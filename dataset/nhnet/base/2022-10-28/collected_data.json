    "maintext": "GEDDES, N.Y. - \"This is the best goddamn state fair we've ever played!\"\nOf course, this was also the first state fair performance in the 22-plus year history of the Dropkick Murphys. But this is a band, evidenced by having taken the open slot vacated by Dickie Betts within a day after the former Allman Brothers Band co-founder suffered a mild stroke Friday, that's down for anything.\nFair officials estimated the crowd at 13,455, but unlike other major Chevy Court performances, when fans camp out hours ahead of time for good seats, large portions of the seating area remained vacant until around showtime.\nBut once the music started, the crowd arrived--I suspect peak attendance to have been 20,000-plus--and didn't stop clapping and howling until the final note was struck an hour and a half later.\nAlmost on cue, the crowd rose to its feet when Sinead O'Connor and The Chieftains' rendition of \"Foggy Dew\" played to introduce the band, like it was the national anthem before a sporting event.\nThe lead singing duties are split between Ken Casey, free of his bass playing duties for the night as he recovers from recent neck surgery, and Al Barr, who provides the throaty growl synonymous with Dropkick Murphys' punky, vicious sound.\nAt one point, Barr said \"it was a little weird\" for the band to play a seated venue and thanked the crowd for not sitting down. And it's true, just about everybody in attendance stayed standing throughout the show, forcing several folks, like my bench mate Jennifer, of Weedsport, who also doubled as my Dropkick Murphys live performance guide, to stand on the benches to see the stage.\nCasey is a man of the people, or more accurately, a man with the people, as the frontman showed no signs of injury as he hopped off the stage, headed down the aisle, and sung \"Rose Tattoo\" from the handicapped-accessible section in the center of the Chevy Court seating area, taking photos with fans along the way.\nBy the end of the song, Casey had parted the sea of screaming fans as he hopped from bleacher to bleacher, surrounded by security guards holding on to him, and used his microphone as a conductor's baton as he led the crowd in singing the song.\nBefore singing \"Jimmy Collins's Wake,\" Casey honored Bill Dinneen, whose name is mentioned in the song. Dinneen, a Syracuse native, was a pitcher for the Boston Americans, later to be known as the Red Sox, and hero in the team's 1903 World Series win. Collins was the team's manager and third baseman.\nClearly somebody did their homework before coming to Syracuse.\nEarlier in the show, during the band's performance of \"Johnny I Hardly Knew Ya,\" a fan threw a Syracuse Crunch jersey onto the stage. The band briefly put it on display near the drums.\nTo call Dropkick Murphys' live performance high-energy is a grave understatement. No, this was a 90-minute non-stop onslaught of fast guitars, guttural, ferocious vocals, dancing and thrashing, because no amount of heat and humidity--and there were plenty of both--was going to hold the band or fans back or stop anyone from slamming on the benches amidst chants of \"let's go Murphys\" during the band's break between the main set and the encore that lasted three minutes but felt like an hour.\nThis may have been Dropkick Murphys' first state fair concert--and the best--but if this show was any indication, it won't be their last.\nDropkick Murphys set list\nNew York State Fair Chevy Court, Aug. 28, 2018\nCaptain Kelly's Kitchen\nThe Boys Are Back\nPrisoner's Song\nSandlot\nJohnny I Hardly Knew Ya\nBlood\nThe State of Massachusetts\nCaught In A Jar\nI Had A Hat\nSunshine Highway\nFields of Athenry\nFolsom Prison Blues (Johnny Cash cover)\nJimmy Collins' Wake\nThe Walking Dead\nPaying My Way\nThe Irish Rover (The Dubliners cover)\nFirst Class Loser\nWorker's Song\nRose Tattoo\nOut Of Our Heads\nGoing Out In Style\nEncore:\nBody of an American (The Pogues cover)\nDirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (AC/DC cover)\nI'm Shipping Up To Boston\nJacob Pucci finds the best in food, entertainment and culture across Upstate New York.

That said, we are sorry and we regret that the fans could have felt disappointed\u201d by Griezmann\u2019s final decision and the way it was delivered, said Mestre.\nPique has defended himself, saying he was not aware whether or not Griezmann was going to stay with Atletico when he got on board with the TV show and that the French player was unsure of what path to take until the last minute.\nHe wrote on Twitter that the documentary was \u201canother way to see the life of a football player and his doubts over the most important decision of his career\u201d.\n(AFP)",

Domestic games: played 51, won 43. Domestic trophies: three out of three. Five-goal hauls: 11. Defeats since Christmas: one.\n\u201cScan the history books, fan back to the big city clubs of Victorian times, linger on the red-shirted eras of the last 50 years.\n\u201cEnglish domestic football has never seen anything quite like this single-season hit from Manchester City. It turns out we really do all live in a sky blue world now.\u201d",

With his 28th goal of the season, the Venezuelan has officially surpassed Roy Lassiter (1996), Chris Wondolowski (2012), and Bradley Wright-Phillips (2014) and now has the most goals ever scored in a single season in Major League Soccer. The record goal was appropriately scored against Atlanta United\u2019s biggest rival, Orlando City.\nThis record is just another on the list of accolades he has collected in MLS, with him already taking the top spot on for most hat tricks in MLS history. On top of all this, he still has eight-plus games left to play to add to his lead.\nTimes like these leave us a chance to remember how lucky we are to be able to watch a player of his quality on a week-to-week basis. Whether or not he leaves soon or later in the future, Martinez has left an impact in MLS and Atlanta that won\u2019t soon be forgotten.\nCongratulations Josef on this achievement!",

Bhadana, a \u201cGujjar\u201d, had joined Rashtriya Lok Dal in 2015 and then BJP before 2017 Lok Sabha elections. He also won from Meerapur Assembly constituency. His induction would help Congress further strengthen its base in Western Uttar Pradesh, as most of its prominent leaders are either in Central or Eastern Uttar Pradesh.\nFormer Union Minister and four-time MP from Mishrikh Lok Sabha constituency in Sitapur, Ram Lal Rahi, was expelled from Congress four years back for participating in Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Swachch Bharat Abiyan.\nAdvertisement\nAsked about the joining of Bhadana, BJP spokesperson Harish Srivastava said, \u201cAise log na ghar ke rehte hain na ghat ke.

It\u2019s a great position to be in for a fighter who hasn\u2019t competed since UFC 202 two years ago, but Diaz feels like he should be the one calling all the shots.\n\u201cI already told you about those guys, I slapped the shit out of both of them,\u201d Diaz told TMZ Sports (shown above). \u201cThey need to quit acting like them motherf*ckers are running shit. There\u2019s one king in this motherf*cker and he\u2019s right here.\u201d\nDiaz went a little deeper and gave his outlook on McGregor vs. Khabib.\n\u201cI think Conor\u2019s got a way better fighting style,\u201d he said. \u201cKhabib\u2019s scared for his life, so I don\u2019t know how good he\u2019s going to do with that. He might get scared and hold on for his life. I hope that\u2019s not happening for the sake of fighting. We don\u2019t need two boring ass champions.\u201d\nWhen asked who he would like to see win UFC 229\u2019s main event, Diaz revealed he wants both fighters to knock each other out. With that unlikely to happen, the UFC veteran is leaning towards whichever fighter shows up to scrap.\n\u201cI ain\u2019t pulling for nobody,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cDouble knockout as far as I\u2019m concerned. But let\u2019s get something. Let\u2019s get a fight. No bitch-ass hold on for your life, \u2018I work so hard\u2019\u2026 That boy [Nurmagomedov] ain\u2019t fought nobody. He went and grabbed on for his life against everybody. He fights like a scared little bitch. I\u2019m going for the fighters in this one.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going for anyone, but as far as fighting style, I got for the fighters usually.\u201d\nWith McGregor recently expressing interest in a trilogy bout with Diaz, who has split two previous Octagon meetings with \u201cNotorious,\u201d Diaz should want the Irishman to pull out the win at UFC 229. A trilogy bout between the two would likely produce better PPV numbers than McGregor vs. Khabib and close out one of the biggest rivalries in MMA history.\nSurprisingly, Diaz isn\u2019t that interested in a third bout with McGregor.\n\u201cI ain\u2019t fighting no trilogy,\u201d he said. \u201cHe already got his ass whipped. He can fight everybody else, I got shit to do too.\u201d\nDiaz also confirmed that he has limited interest in a showdown with Khabib.\n\u201cI don\u2019t wanna fight no boring ass fighter,\u201d he said. \u201cI already slapped the guy on the street and that motherf*cker didn\u2019t do shit. And then he tried to roll up with his boys and I slapped all those motherfuckers too. Pussies.\u201d\nWhile Diaz has always been the type of fighter to march to the beat of his own drum, it\u2019s highly unlikely that the lightweight fan favorite would bypass a lucrative grudge match with McGregor or a title fight opposite Khabib. Either fight makes sense for Diaz if he\u2019s able to defeat Poirier at UFC 230.\nWe\u2019ll have to wait and see who comes out on top at UFC 229 and if Diaz changes his tune post-fight.\nMMAmania.com will deliver LIVE round-by-round, blow-by-blow coverage of the entire UFC 229 fight card on fight night (click here), starting with the Fight Pass \u201cPrelims\u201d matches online, which are scheduled to begin at 6:30 p.m. ET, then the remaining undercard balance on FOX Sports 1 at 8 p.m. ET, before the PPV main card start time at 10 p.m. ET.",

Zhang landed a nice overhand left, but Torres countered with a right hand of her own. Zhang landed two more spinning back kicks and a nice shot upstairs, triggering a scramble that Torres was able to escape with a quickness. Zhang struggled for a takedown with two minutes remaining in the round, which Torres fought off well, but the Chinese fighter managed to circle behind her and jump on her back. Torres was eventually able to spin her off and clipped her with a nice, hard right hand on the break. Torres scored her own takedown with a few seconds remaining in the round, but Zhang pulled off a nice reversal as the clock expired.\nRound two opened with both ladies bouncing back-and-forth, with Zhang scoring first with a flush spinning backfist. It took about two minutes for things to heat up, with both fighters trading hard shots in the center of the Octagon. Zhang attempted to throw Torres, but she stood her ground and used the fence to remain upright. Zhang eventually got her to the ground and dished out a little ground-and-pound before Torres flipped her over and landed on top in her guard. Torres was unable to do anything with the dominant position, though, with Zhang landing a nice upkick at the buzzer.\nTorres started the third and final frame with a nice front kick to Zhang\u2019s belly, then an effective sidekick that also found its mark. Zhang responded by charging in with a wild combination, but it was Torres who scored with the harder shots as she was trying to retreat. Torres caught a spinning back kick, but then ate an elbow to the face as both her hands were occupied. Zhang scored a big takedown along the cage, but was unable to land anything significant as Torres hid her face in Zhang\u2019s mid-section. Zhang eventually was able to land some hard elbows to Torres\u2019 face \u2014 she was unable to get out from underneath her Chinese opponent.\nAnd that ultimately is what did her in, as Zhang controlled her for the duration of the round. She was also the more dynamic and dominant fighter throughout all three rounds, earning a unanimous decision nod from all three judges who were sitting ringside.\nZhang is on her way up, while Torres is on her way down. Indeed, a 19-fight win streak in MMA is impressive. And she was able to accomplish it at the expense of the No. 7-ranked female in the division.\nFor complete UFC 235: \u201cJones vs. Smith\u201d results, including play-by-play updates, click here.",

After a couple of softer opponents, the Warriors tested their mettle against a very good Boston Celtics team. Now, fresh off their four-point win in Boston on Saturday, the Warriors head into Indiana to take on the Pacers in the final game of this road trip.\nGame Details\nWHO: Golden State Warriors (35-15) at Indiana Pacers (32-16)\nWHEN: Monday, January 28; 4 p.m.\nWHERE: Bankers Life Fieldhouse \u2014 Indianapolis, IN\nWATCH: NBCSBA, NBA TV\nRADIO: 95.7 The Game\nBlog buddy: Indy Cornrows\nA team without their star\nVictor Oladipo was having a breakout year while leading the surprising Indiana Pacers to the third seed in the East. He led the team in scoring with nearly 19 points per game and was near the top for the team in both rebounds (5.6) and assists (5.2) ...so losing him sucks. In case you missed it, he went down just two games ago on a non-contact play \u2014 the diagnosis is not good and he\u2019s done for the season.\nOne of my favorite parts about sports in general, and the NBA specifically, is that once a player gets injured, everyone is immediately rooting for them hard! Here\u2019s Demarcus Cousins, talking about injuries and how hard these men have to work to get back on the court.\nDeMarcus Cousins just went through a grueling rehab. He feels for Victor Oladipo: \u201cWe put our bodies through so much in the NBA. I feel like it\u2019s undervalued.\u201d pic.twitter.com/dEvFErmrzY \u2014 Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) January 27, 2019\nWithout Oladipo, the third place Pacers are assumed to begin an inexorable slide back down the standings. How far and how fast they slide will be determined by how well the remaining players are able to step up and fill the void left by Oladipo\u2019s unfortunate disappearance. They have got some options though.\nThad Young, a player many Warriors fans have been keeping tabs on for years, will step up \u2014 as will Bojan Bogdanovic and Darren Collison \u2014 but will it be enough? Probably not against a Warriors team that is firing on all cylinders. But Oladipo and his injury have redefined the entire Pacers season and I assume they are now somewhat in need of a moral victory or two. A close game against this Warriors squad is probably what they\u2019re aiming for tonight.\nCan the Warriors keep winning?\nNo strangers to record-setting hot streaks, Golden State finds themselves well positioned to reel off a nice streak of wins here. Already at ten straight, the Warriors haven\u2019t lost a game since that squeaker they dropped to the Houston Rockets back on January 3rd.\nThe upcoming schedule is not without danger \u2014 and of course anyone can lose on any given night \u2014 but after this Pacers game, the Warriors have a lot of very winnable games on the horizon.\nInterestingly, while the team\u2019s league-leading offense is continuing to climb, so is the defense. Once a perennial top defensive squad, the Warriors now rank 15th in team defensive efficiency. As Brady would say \u201cdecidedly mediocre.\u201d\nOne element to pay attention to: Demarcus Cousins\u2019 foul rate. Right now, the big man is averaging just over four fouls per game, which pro-rates to more than seven fouls per 36 minutes of action. Yes, he is recovering from a severe lower leg injury and hasn\u2019t played real basketball in over a year, but fouling like this is unsustainable.\nAgainst the Boston Celtics on Saturday, Cousins picked up five fouls in just 23 minutes. While the team doesn\u2019t really need him for much more time than that, the abundant fouls can lead to all sorts of problems by putting the other team in the bonus, screwing up our rotations or getting other players in their own heads worried about adding more fouls to the pile.\nBoston was the first real test for Cousins. The Pacers may not be quite on par with the Celtics after losing their best player, but they do have a number of good big men that they\u2019ll be using. Right now, the Warriors aren\u2019t too worried about all these fouls, but as the season moves along, at some point, this is going to become a discussion.",

Iowa\u2019s market might be small compared to the likes of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, but it should benefit from being able to capitalize on a lack of legal sports betting in Nebraska and Minnesota.\nNebaskans already spend more than $300 mm each year at Iowa casinos.\nIowa could use sports betting as much as any other gaming.

    "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/did-michael-cohen-actually-commit-campaign-finance-violations": "President Trump\u2019s longtime attorney Michael Cohen pointed a finger at his old boss Tuesday, saying he committed two campaign finance crimes at the direction of Trump when he arranged six-figure payoffs for women alleging affairs.\n\"His crime was the president's crime,\" Cohen attorney Lanny Davis, a Democrat who represented former President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, told Fox News Wednesday.\nBut many legal experts say Cohen didn't actually commit a campaign finance crime, leading to speculation about why he pleaded guilty, and what his confession may mean for Trump.\nThe criminal case against Cohen dealt largely with unrelated tax and bank fraud charges. The campaign finance charges were the only ones directly related to Trump, and in pleading guilty he accepted a contentious legal theory that payoffs to porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal were campaign contributions.\nAmong election law experts, however, there\u2019s doubt that Cohen committed a crime. Skeptics say silencing the women may have helped Trump during the 2016 campaign, but also protected Trump's family and company from embarrassment, meaning it wasn't an election contribution.\n[Also read: Trump's 'bad week': Manafort found guilty, Cohen enters plea deal]\nExperts point to the failed prosecution against former Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., whose wealthy supporters gave money to his mistress Rielle Hunter to silence her.\n\u201cThe big fish here is Trump, and this is a long way toward trying to \u2018get Trump,\u2019 so to speak,\u201d said Bradley Smith, a former Republican chairman of the Federal Election Commission.\nBut Smith, a professor at Capital University Law School who is \"not a big fan of Trump,\" said Cohen\u2019s plea doesn\u2019t necessarily torpedo the president, given the legal question is unsettled.\n\u201cI think it is not a crime to pay a mistress in this way, because it\u2019s not a campaign expense, even though it is something that potentially benefits the campaign,\u201d he said.\nSmith said campaign finance offenses are generally dealt with civil fines unless the offense is \u201cknowing and willful,\u201d a difficult standard when precedent is unsettled. \u201cKnowing and willful is what makes it criminal, absent the knowing and willful it\u2019s just a civil violation and you get a fine,\u201d he said.\nSmith said it\u2019s conceivable, however, that prosecutors would seek some tangential criminal charge against Trump pegged to Cohen\u2019s conduct, such as a fraud or conspiracy charge.\nOutside of court Tuesday, prosecutor Robert Khuzami, deputy U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said Cohen submitted \u201csham\u201d invoices for reimbursement after acting at Trump's direction to pay $130,000 to Daniels and to broker payment of $150,000 to McDougal by the Trump-allied National Enquirer\u2019s parent company.\nDavid Warrington, a Republican attorney who formerly worked with the Trump campaign, said he believes prosecutors may have sought Cohen\u2019s plea to the campaign finance counts to help special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\u201cSlapping on the campaign finance violation, maybe somebody in the prosecutors office thinks that helps them build a narrative in the Mueller investigation, even though this was done by the Southern District of New York,\u201d he said.\nWarrington said he could imagine a legal theory from Mueller's team relying on the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act of 2002, a corporate accountability law that he said has been wielded by prosecutors because of a broad prohibition on creating false records.\n\"I could see the Department of Justice coming up with a theory that allegedly false invoices would amount to a violation of Sarbanes-Oxley, in conjunction with the Federal Election Campaign Act alleged violation Cohen did,\" Warrington said. \"All of that is a stretch from a legal standpoint, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily stop the Department of Justice from investigating and charging someone under those theories.\"\nWarrington also believes that the alleged campaign finance crimes aren\u2019t actually crimes, and questions the legal guidance of Davis.\n\u201cLanny Davis had his client plead guilty to a crime that isn't a crime,\u201d Warrington said. \"Who\u2019s Lanny Davis really working for, Michael Cohen or the Clintons?\u201d\nTrump made the same argument Wednesday, tweeting, \"Michael Cohen plead guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime.\"\nWarrington said he believes that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the Southern District of New York, which prosecuted Cohen after a referral from Mueller\u2019s team, would not seek to unilaterally indict Trump, instead deferring to Mueller on the potentially unprecedented action.\nOther experts believe the Cohen plea implicating Trump may be intended primarily for political effect, potentially empowering an impeachment push among Democrats, should they regain control of Congress in the November election.\n\"The idea that this is a campaign contribution or expenditure is highly speculative,\" said attorney Cleta Mitchell, a Republican election law expert, saying that she believes Cohen's plea was not motivated by legal strategy, but by political motivations.\nHans von Spakovsky, a former member of the FEC who works at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that \"I believe the Justice Department would have a hard time prosecuting any such claim\" that payoffs were campaign expenses.\nDavis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nSmith, the former Republican FEC chairman who is not a Trump supporter, said he's concerned about prosecutors' actions.\n\u201cI find the whole thing kind of disturbing \u2013 what seems to be almost a determination to use whatever laws we can find to get Trump because a lot of people know Trump\u2019s such a bad guy, he must be violating the law, and even if he\u2019s not, we have to get him anyways,\" he said.",

The two sides were separated by 4th Avenue and plenty of Seattle police, but they were still able to taunt and shout at each other.\nThe rally began around 1 p.m. with Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson giving brief remarks. City Hall plaza was secured by police, but also dozens of armed men wearing homemade military-style gear. They forced some attendees to open their bags for security checks. Seattle police aided the security team by ejecting people who refused to be searched. The security was provided by the Oath Keepers and III% groups. A man from Eastern Washington who called himself \"A.D.\" was inside the rally wearing a Confederate flag on his head. He said he came to the rally to fight for gun rights. The rally was initially called to protest I-1639, a gun safety ballot initiative. A Thurston County judge on Friday blocked that initiative after a challenge brought by the National Rifle Association.\nAcross 4th Avenue from A.D., left wing protesters held up pictures of Heather Heyer, the woman killed by a white nationalist in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. A.D. said he wore the Confederate flag on his head because his family is from the south. \"I'm not a racist, I'm a lover of all,\" he said, underscoring that his family did not fight in the Civil War for slavery. \"I don't agree with owning slaves.\"\nCounter protesters invoked Heather Heyer, who died in August 2017 when a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd in Charlottesville, Virginia Men from the Oath Keepers and III% groups provided extra security. They dressed in homemade military garb and carried semiautomatic handguns. Angie True Fryar wore her friend's shirt to the rally.

This is a fallout from the Easter Sunday attacks in which over 250 people were killed.\nNine suicide bombers, including a woman, carried out a series of devastating blasts that tore through three churches and three luxury hotels, killing 258 people and injuring over 500 others on the Easter Sunday.\nThe Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, but the government has blamed local Islamist extremist group, the National Thawheed Jama\u2019ath (NTJ), for the bombings.\nSome inflammatory exchanges happened between the two communities in the town since Saturday, the residents said.\nA Catholic woman claimed that she was threatened inside a Muslim-owned shop.\nCardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the Archbishop of Colombo, cancelled all masses since the Easter Sunday until the security situation could improve.\nIt was just this morning that churches resumed their normal Sunday services since the attack.\nEarly this month, several people were injured in clashes between Muslims and Christians in Negombo, a majority Christian town where St. Sebastian\u2019s Church was targeted during the Easter attacks.\nAfter clashes in Negombo, Cardinal Ranjith appealed to Christians and other communities to show restraint.\n\u201cI appeal to all Catholic and Christian brothers and sisters not to hurt even a single Muslim person because they are our brothers, because they are part of our religious culture,\u201d said Ranjith.\n\u201cTherefore please avoid hurting them and try to create a better spirit of understanding and good relations between all the communities of Sri Lanka.\u201d\nIn his address to the nation after the Easter Sunday blasts, President Maithripala Sirisena called on the public to refrain from looking at the Muslim community with a suspicious eye following the attacks.\n\u201cIt was only a small group which had engaged in such acts of terror,\u201d he added.\nSri Lanka has a population of 21 million which is a patchwork of ethnicities and religions, dominated by the Sinhalese Buddhist majority.\nMuslims account for 10 per cent of the population and are the second-largest minority after Hindus.

Mousasi comes into the contest riding a seven-fight win streak that goes back to 2016. Since coming over to Bellator last year after his UFC contract expired, Mousasi scored a controversial decision win over Alexander Shlemenko at Bellator 185 in October 2017 before scoring a first-round TKO of Rafael Carvalho back in May at UFC 200 to win the promotion\u2019s middleweight title. MacDonald also came over to Bellator after his UFC deal expired, making his promotional debut with a second-round submission of Paul Daley at Bellator 179 in May 2017. He then defeated Douglas Lima by decision at Bellator 192 back in January to become welterweight champion.\nWith a win, MacDonald would become the first fighter in Bellator history to hold titles in two weight classes simultaneously. He would also become the second Bellator fighter to win titles in two weight classes (Joe Warren is the first, with title wins at featherweight and bantamweight).\nThe co-main event will see the fourth installment of the legendary rivalry between Quinton \u201cRampage\u201d Jackson and Wanderlei Silva. Silva won the first two bouts \u2014 via first-round TKO in the final of the PRIDE Middleweight Grand Prix at PRIDE Final Conflict in November 2003 and via second-round KO to retain the PRIDE Middleweight Title at PRIDE 28. When the two met under the UFC banner at UFC 92 in December 2008, Jackson was the one scoring the first-round knockout.\nJackson enters this bout on back-to-back losses, losing to Muhammed \u201cKing Mo\u201d Lawal at Bellator 175 in March 2017 before falling to Chael Sonnen in the first Bellator Heavyweight Grand Prix match back in January at Bellator 192. Meanwhile, this will be Silva\u2019s first fight since losing to Sonnen in the main event of the June 2017 Bellator NYC pay-per-view. That was Silva\u2019s first fight since serving a three-year suspension from the Nevada State Athletic Commission.\nBellator 206 will also feature the start of the Welterweight Grand Prix, with the winner ultimately claiming the Bellator Welterweight Title and a cash prize of $1 million from rapper 50 Cent. The tournament\u2019s opening bout will see former champions Douglas Lima and Andrey Koreshkov.\nBellator 206 Results:\nBellator Middleweight Championship: (c.) Gegard Mousasi def.

    "https://www.tomsguide.com/us/samsung-galaxy-s10,review-6279.html": "The 6.1-inch Galaxy S10 may be the middle child of the S10 lineup, but don't sleep on this powerful smartphone or its beautiful display.\nWhy you can trust Tom's Guide Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test .\nMake way, Galaxy S10. The Samsung Galaxy S20 series is here, which bring advanced cameras, 120Hz displays and improved performance to the company's flagship phone.\nThat brings up an interesting question: should prospective buyers entertain one of the newer models, or snag a Galaxy S10 on the cheap, while many retailers have heavily discounted their stock?\nThat all depends on how badly you want the S20's upgrades. The S20 models packs 5G connectivity and Snapdragon 865 power; a triple-lens rear camera with a 48-megapixel, 3x optical zoom lens; a 120Hz display; and a larger, 4,000-mAh battery, among other upgrades. es.\nYou could save nearly a quarter of what the S20 costs and still get one of last year's finest phones in the Galaxy S10, with its dazzling OLED display and great (if not class-leading) cameras that come alive when shooting low light. Even with the S20 looming large, the S10 is still every bit the jack-of-all-trades premium Android handset it was when it launched \u2014 not to mention one of the best smartphones money can buy.\nIf you're on the fence, be sure to check our Galaxy S20 versus Galaxy S10 comparison to see all the differences. And see how Samsung's flagship stacks up against Apple's in our Galaxy S10 vs iPhone 11 Pro face-off.\nSamsung Galaxy S10 review: Price and availability\nYou can buy a Galaxy S10 from all major retailers. The big four U.S. carriers \u2014 AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile \u2014 carry the S10, as do U.S. Cellular and Xfinity Mobile. You can also order an unlocked Galaxy S10 (opens in new tab) online.\nFollowing the Galaxy S20's launch, Samsung began offering the 128GB Galaxy S10 for $749 and the 512GB model for $899. Those models cost $899 and $1,149, respectively, before the S20 entered the picture. Check out our roundup of best Galaxy S10 deals as well as our Samsung promo codes for more opportunities to save.\nSamsung Galaxy S10 review: Specs\nPrice $899 Display (Resolution) 6.1-inch Dynamic AMOLED (3040 x 1440) Rear Camera(s) 16-MP ultrawide (\u0192/2.2), 12-MP dual-pixel wide (\u0192/1.5, \u0192/2.4), 12-MP telephoto (\u0192/2.4) Front Camera 10-MP dual-pixel (f/1.9) CPU Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 RAM 8GB Storage 128GB, 512GB microSD Yes, up to 512GB Battery 3,400 mAh Colors Prism Black, Prism White, Prism Blue, Prism Green (except U.S.), Flamingo Pink (except U.K.) Size 5.9 x 2.77 x 0.3 inches Weight 5.5 ounces\nSamsung Galaxy S10 review: Display\nAlmost every other smartphone maker has eliminated bezels by adding a notch that swoops down from the top of the device to disguise the front-facing camera. Samsung avoided that trend altogether with all three Galaxy S10 models, instead developing the unique Infinity-O display, which embeds the front-facing camera lens directly in the screen.\nThe midsized S10 sports a hole-punch-size cutout for its single selfie lens, which is far less distracting than the S10 Plus' oval-shaped cutout.\nI read lengthy New York Times articles, raced my trusty Mitsubishi Lancer in Asphalt 9 and took multiple selfies with the S10, and the hole punch never took away from the experience. When snapping photos of myself, I realized that the obvious cutout ensured I always looked directly at the lens. For those of you who never seem to nail eye contact with the camera lens, the S10's cutout is a great feature, making this task ridiculously easy.\nYou can also hide the hole punch with Samsung's cleverly designed wallpapers. That won't help when you're streaming videos or browsing the web, but the disguise looks pretty damn good when you show it off to friends. The slightly curved glass practically cascades from the phone's frame. That curved glass also makes it a little too easy to accidentally press something simply because you were holding the device; this was also a problem in past generations of Galaxy phones. If you want to hide the cutout altogether, that\u2019s an option, but that effect is so ugly that you may as well buy another Android device with a notch and call it a day.\nThe S10 broke DisplayMate's records for display brightness, color accuracy and image contrast, and the list goes on, so the S10 earned an A+ for a virtually perfect display. We found the same in our testing. The S10's AMOLED display covers 208.2 percent of the sRGB color gamut and notched a 0.38 Delta-E rating for color accuracy (numbers closer to 0 are better). The S10 hit a peak brightness of 611 nits when we shone a flashlight on its sensor, making the phone's panel almost as bright as that on the S10 Plus (625 nits). The Pixel 3 is ultra dim by comparison, hitting just 362 nits.\nSamsung Galaxy S10 review: Design\nAside from the hole-punch display, the Galaxy S10 is the same as every other smartphone on the market. That's not a bad thing, but if you're waiting for innovative smartphone design before spending close to $1,000 (or far more) for a new device, you'll have to hold out for the foldable phones arriving this year.\nThe 6.1-inch S10 has the exact same dimensions as Apple's 6.1-inch, $749 iPhone 11 but is more than a full ounce lighter. The S10 isn't a one-handed device for those of us with petite paws; the 5.8-inch S10e is both smaller and cheaper, so go for that device if size is the deciding factor for you in phone selection.\nThe S10 comes in the same colors as the larger $999 Galaxy S10 Plus, which offers a few simple options (like white and black) and some bolder ones (blue, Flamingo Pink). I tested the Prism Black model, which is a terribly boring glassy black slab. I suggest going with Prism White, or one of the more interesting hues, which will help you stand out. The black model collects so many fingerprints that you'll look like a really uncool forensics investigator.\nLike all Galaxy S models, the S10 is rated IP68 water-resistant, meaning it can survive in up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) of water for a half-hour. That's respectable in the flagship phone realm, and thus earns the Galaxy S10 a spot on our list of the best waterproof phones.\nSamsung Galaxy S10 review: Cameras\nThe S10 and S10 Plus have one key difference, aside from the larger phone's bigger display: The Plus sports an additional 8-megapixel, depth-sensing, front-facing camera for better selfies. Both devices have a selfie-portrait effect, which enables other effects, including wind-swept and black-and-white backgrounds.\nBut the S10 achieves those effects using software instead of an additional depth-sensing lens, and it shows when comparing the two side by side.\nAs you can see in the black-and-white Live Focus image above, the S10's camera software gets a little messy around my curls. Meanwhile, the S10 Plus seamlessly softens the background around them, creating a more natural effect.\nOtherwise, the S10 and S10 Plus have the same rear triple-lens camera array, with telephoto, standard and wide-angle shooters for capturing a variety of viewpoints. I compared the S10 with a Pixel 3 by capturing a Brooklyn storefront. Both images capture the detail in the brick and the gleam of the coffee shop's sign, but the S10 is more color-accurate; the neon \"No Sleep Till\" sign glowed more yellow than blue-white in real life.\nI also compared the S10's telephoto lens and optical zoom with the iPhone XS cameras by playing tourist with a photo of the Statue of Liberty as seen from the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. It's an almost impossible shot, because Lady Liberty is extremely far away and the midday sun is not helpful. The iPhone's optical zoom fared better, as the S10's image is darker, with more artifacts in the photo.\nThe S10's cameras are good, though if you want more dramatic photos, the Pixel 3 and newer Pixel 4 remain better options, while the latest iPhones capture more-natural shots.\nSamsung Galaxy S10 review: Security\nSamsung can't compete with Apple on biometric authentication, and we're not sure the Galaxy maker is even trying. This is one area where Samsung needs to work harder to ensure that unlocking your phone and authenticating payments are locked down with the most secure biometric scans that money can buy.\nIn our testing, the S10's facial recognition is easily fooled by a photograph of a person's face. That's just plain embarrassing. The photo trick doesn't work if you turn off Fast Facial Recognition in the S10's settings, but the facial-authentication method is still less secure than it should be. That's because Samsung doesn't use hardware to create a 3D map of your face the way Apple does with its Face ID.\nThe S10's in-display reader is more secure, due to an ultrasonic sensor that maps the 3D curves of your fingerprint. You have to press a little longer on the sensor than you would think, but the phone unlocks quickly enough, and I appreciate that it's not a two-step process, like on the iPhone XS. (On that phone, you have to wait for the camera to scan your face and then swipe up.)\nThere have been some complaints about the Galaxy S10's ultrasonic fingerprint sensor not working properly when a screen protector is applied to the phone. In fact, one woman claims that anyone could unlock her Galaxy S10 after she purchased a screen protector off of eBay. Fortunately, Samsung issued an update designed to fix this problem shortly after release.\nSamsung Galaxy S10 review: Performance\nThe Galaxy S10 Plus and smaller S10 have the same exact specs, and it shows in their performance power. With Qualcomm's 7-nanometer Snapdragon 855 processor and 8GB of RAM, the S10 easily matches the larger S10 Plus' speed.\nThe two devices scored evenly on Geekbench 4, a synthetic test of overall system performance. The S10 notched a multicore score of 10,813, sneaking just ahead of the larger phone's performance (10,732). Both phones lag behind the iPhone XS' A12 Bionic processor, which blows away the competition with a 11,420 score.\nBut both S10s handily crush their Android rivals, including the Pixel 3 (7,316) and OnePlus 6T (8,972).\nMORE: Best phones: Here are the 10 best available\nAnd the S10, like the S10 Plus, pulled ahead of both the iPhone and competing Android flagships in the 3DMark Slingshot Extreme graphics-performance benchmark. The S10 notched a score of 5,606 on the OpenGL ES 3.1 test, just behind the larger S10's score (5,648) and easily ahead of the results from the OnePlus 6T (5,183), Pixel 3 (4,396) and iPhone XS (4,339).\nI unlocked one premium race car after another in my favorite graphics-intensive game, Asphalt 9, easily killing 45 minutes burning rubber around the globe. The S10 never lagged or felt warm to the touch.\nSamsung Galaxy S10 review: Battery life\nThe Galaxy S10's 3,400-mAh battery isn't as large as the massive, 4,100-mAh pack inside the S10 Plus. And as expected, the smaller device doesn't last as long on a charge, though you can still go a long time without topping off your battery.\nThe S10 eked out 10 hours and 19 minutes on the Tom's Guide Battery Test, which consists of continuous web surfing over 4G LTE. The S10 Plus landed near the top of our list of longest-lasting smartphones, reaching 12 hours and 35 seconds on that test.\nMORE: Smartphones with the longest battery life\nThe Galaxy S9 Plus, released in 2018, also lasts longer on a charge than the S10, but that older phone has a slightly larger, 3,500-mAh battery. The S10e and its smaller, 3,100-mAh unit died after 9 hours and 42 minutes. The S10 outlasted both the iPhone XS (9:41) and the Pixel 3 XL (9:30). In the iPhone 11 Pro vs. Samsung's S10 face-off, the Pro lasted four minutes longer (10:23) than the S10.\nAll three Galaxy S10 models have a new Wireless PowerShare feature that we wish every smartphone on the market offered. The tool, which you toggle on in the shortcuts menu by swiping down, lets you charge up any Qi-compatible device.\nI used this to charge up Samsung's Galaxy Watch Active, and the process works quickly and seamlessly.\nSamsung Galaxy S10 review: Software\nThe OneUI software on the Galaxy S10 is streamlined as promised and fairly to easy to use. The settings menu, for example, presents a lot fewer options than previous Galaxy phones.\nBy default, there\u2019s a Recent Apps, Home Button and Back button along the bottom of the display. But you can switch to full-screen gestures. You'll swipe up from the bottom left to see recent apps, up from the bottom to go home and up from the right to go back.\nThe Galaxy S10 also now offers some of the more compelling software features of the Galaxy Note 10. These include Live Focus video for applying bokeh effects to your footage and Samsung DeX for PC, which allows you to see notifications and send and receive messages on your laptop without having to fire up your phone.\nSamsung Galaxy S10 review: Verdict\nEven more than a year since its release, the Galaxy S10 offers superfast performance and a beautiful display, with a less distracting camera cutout than on the larger, pricier S10 Plus. I also love that the S10 offers my favorite feature, Wireless PowerShare. That means you don't have to splurge on the priciest Galaxy to reverse-charge all of your devices.\nApple and Google's latest flagships sport better cameras, depending on whether you prefer more dramatic or more natural shots. And if you want longer battery life, the S10 Plus is a better bet, provided you can handle a larger, 6.4-inch screen. We do prefer the S10 to the value-priced OnePlus 6T, based on our face-off.\nSure, the Galaxy S20's redesigned triple-camera stack and 5G connectivity could put the Galaxy S10's photography and data speeds to shame. But at the end of the day, if all you're looking for is a well-rounded, well-crafted Android flagship that can do it all \u2014 including work with a pair of good old-fashioned wired headphones \u2014 for a price you can sleep easy at night spending, the Galaxy S10 remains an unbeatable proposition.",

The Galaxy Note series featured the largest displays, the most processing oomph, and the features most obviously geared toward anyone who subscribed to the theory that Bigger Is Almost Always Better.\nGalaxy S10 Plus, S10 (left) and Note 9\nThat question became a bit more complex when the Galaxy S10 lineup came out this spring, highlighted by the Galaxy S10 Plus, one of the best phones we saw in 2019. The S10 Plus' display is every bit as big as what you'd find on Samsung phablets like the Galaxy Note 9, and the 6.1-inch Galaxy S10 isn't that much smaller. What's more, Samsung has packed the kind of features into the Galaxy S10 that used to be firmly in the Note's domain. As a result, the choice of which big-screen Samsung phone to get isn't as clear as it was before.\nWe've reviewed both the S10 Plus and S10, with enough hands-on time to compare and contrast these two phones with the older Note 9.

To see how Samsung's newer phablets compare to the S10 lineup, check out our Note 10 vs. Galaxy S10 face-off.\nPhone\nGalaxy S10\nGalaxy S10 Plus\nGalaxy Note 9\nStarting Price\n$899 (opens in new tab)\n$999 (opens in new tab)\n$999\nScreen (Resolution)\n6.1-inch Dynamic AMOLED (3040 x 1440) 6.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED (3040 x 1440) 6.4-inch Super AMOLED (2960 x 1440) CPU\nSnapdragon 855\nSnapdragon 855 Snapdragon 845 RAM\n8GB\n8GB/12GB\n6GB/8GB\nStorage\n128GB, 512GB\n128GB, 512GB/1TB\n128GB/512GB\nMicroSD?\nYes, up to 512GB\nYes, up to 512GB Yes, up to 512GB Rear Camera\n16-MP ultra-wide (f/2.2), 12-MP dual-pixel wide (f/1.5, f/2.4), 12-MP telephoto (f/2.4) 16-MP ultra-wide (f/2.2), 12-MP dual-pixel wide (f/1.5, f/2.4), 12-MP telephoto (f/2.4)\nDual 12-MP (f/1.5, f/2.4) Front Camera\n10-MP dual-pixel (f/1.9)\n10-MP dual-pixel (f/1.9), 8-MP depth sensing\n8-MP (f/1.7)\nFingerprint Sensor\nUltrasonic in-display\nUltrasonic in-display Rear-mounted\nBattery\n3,4,00 mAh\n4,100 mAh\n4,000 mAh\nBattery Life (Hrs:Mins)\nTBD\n12:35\n11:26\nS Pen Support?\nNo\nNo\nYes\nSize\n5.9 x 2.77 x 0.3 inches 6.2 x 2.91 x 0.3 inches 6.3 x 3 x 0.3 inches Weight\n5.5 ounces\n6.2 ounces\n7.1 ounces\nColors\nFlamingo Pink, Prism Black, Prism White, Prism Blue, Prism Green Flamingo Pink, Prism Black, Prism White, Prism Blue, Prism Green, Ceramic White, Ceramic Black Lavender Purple, Ocean Blue, Cloud Silver, Midnight Black\nDesign and Display\nWhen comparing the Galaxy S10 and the Galaxy Note 9, it's hard to start anywhere other than the displays. That's because the S10 Plus model now features a 6.4-inch OLED panel stretching from edge to edge, just like the Note 9.\nGalaxy S10 Plus and S10\nBut there are some key differences with that screen. The resolution on the S10 Plus is a bit sharper at 3040 x 1440 to the Note 9's 2960 x 1440. The S10 Plus also uses Samsung's new Dynamic OLED panel, which should feature a wider range of colors due to its support for dynamic-tone mapping. The 6.1-inch S10 offers the same resolution as the S10 Plus on its Dynamic OLED screen\nGalaxy S10 Plus\nThat said, when we tested the S10 Plus' display, it registered 136.5% of the sRGB color gamut, compared to 224% for the Note 9. The S10 Plus displays colors more accurately, with a Delta-E score of 0.29 to the Note 9's 0.34. (Numbers closer to zero are better.) The S10 Plus has a slightly brighter screen as well (625 nits versus 604 nits for the Note 9), though we got that number by shining a flashlight at the S10's sensor.\nThe smaller S10 compares more favorably, capturing 208.2% of the sRGB color gamut. Its Delta-E rating of 0.38 was a shade worse than the Note 9's score. And the S10 is plenty bright, too, with a reading of 611 nits.\nSamsung's phones also achieve their edge-to-edge displays in different ways. The Note 9 features a bezel at the top to house its front-facing camera. But the S10 and S10 Plus opt for Samsung's new Infinity O display and its punch-hole design, where the camera is housed in a cutout in the middle of the screen. (In the S10 Plus's case, that cutout contains two front cameras, as we'll discuss in a moment.) The end result is that the S10 Plus squeezes more screen into a smaller form factor than the Note 9, but that punch hole could stand out when you're using apps or watching videos that fill the whole screen.\nGalaxy Note 9\nRegarding form factor, the S10 Plus is a little shorter and less wide than the Note 9 at 6.2 x 2.91 x 0.3 inches. It weighs less, too, tipping the scales at 6.17 ounces to the Note 9's 7.1 ounces. With its smaller screen, the S10 is the most compact of the bunch at 5.9 x 2.77 x 0.3 inches and 5.5 ounces. (There's an even smaller version, the Galaxy S10e, but it lacks some of the higher-end features of the S10 and S10 Plus and really isn't much of an alternative to the Note 9.)\nAnother big design change becomes apparent when you spend some time with the phones. The S10 and S10 Plus use an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor that fits underneath their displays. (A modest cutout gives you a clue as to where to place your finger to unlock your phone.) The Note 9, like other recent Samsung phones, puts the fingerprint sensor on the back. (Though thankfully, it's beneath the dual cameras instead of next to the lenses.)\nMORE: Best Galaxy S10 Deals Right Now\nYou'll get contrasting choices in colors depending on which phone you favor. The Note 9 comes in four shades \u2014 Lavender Purple, Ocean Blue, Cloud Silver and Midnight Black. S10 shoppers can choose between Flamingo Pink (unless you're in the U.K.), Prism Black, Prism White and Prism Blue. (If you're outside the U.S., add Prism Green to the mix.) Higher-capacity versions of the S10 Plus come in Ceramic Black or Ceramic White.\nWinner: Galaxy S10\nCameras\nSamsung introduced dual cameras to its flagship phones with the Note 8, and the Note 9 continued that tradition with a pair of 12-megapixel shooters. The S10 and S10 Plus up the ante by adding a third lens to the back \u2014 a 16-MP ultra-wide-angle camera joins the 12-MP main lens and 12-MP telephoto shooter. (The 6.1-inch Galaxy S10 features this triple-lens setup, too.)\nGalaxy Note 9\nThat means either S10 model will give you the option of pulling back when you want a shot that captures more of the surrounding details, while also letting you zoom in as you can with the Note 9. The S10 main dual-pixel camera has the same variable aperture as the Note 9 that lets in more light when you're taking pictures in the dark.\nGalaxy Note 9\nThe secret sauce to the Note 9's camera was artificial intelligence, capable of recognizing different scenes and adjusting camera settings accordingly. The S10 models add more smarts to now recognize 30 different scenes, compared with the Note 9's 20.\nUp front, you get more lenses on the S10 Plus, too. There's an 8-MP depth-sensing camera joining the 10-MP selfie cam on Samsung's newest phone. The Note 9 gets by with a single 8-MP lens up front. Samsung says the two lens on the S10 Plus can improve the bokeh effects on portrait shots, and that the new phone's front cameras can capture Ultra-HD video, too.\nWe pitted the Galaxy S10 Plus against the Note 9 in a camera face-off. (The camera set-ups on the S10 and S10 Plus are pretty much the same, save for that extra selfie cam on the S10 Plus, so we'd expect similar results if we used Samsung's S10 in a photo face-off with the Note 9.) There wasn't much separating the two phones, and in some tests, the Note 9 actually did better than the newer models. This indoor shot of baked goods, for example, features better contrast in the Note 9's image, without as much color saturation. The Note 9 also performed better in low light.\nOnce outside, though, we began to see the benefits of the triple lenses on the Galaxy S10 Plus. The ultra-wide lens let us pull back and capture more details, and when we used the telephoto lens, as in this shot of some tulips, the S10 Plus did a better job handling shadows.\nThe S10 Plus also fared better when taking group portraits and selfies. In this self-portrait, a lot of sunlight comes streaming in from the left, and it proves too much for the Note 9 to handle with some of my colleague Adam's face washed out in the final shot. The S10 Plus' effort is better balanced and background details look sharper.\nWinner: Galaxy S10\nPerformance\nAfter benchmarking Samsung's phones, we have a clear sense of how the S10 performs compared to the Note 9s. The Note 9 is no performance slouch, running on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 845, the chipset of choice for 2018's flagship Android devices. But all the Galaxy S10 models feature a new system-on-chip, the Snapdragon 855, which Qualcomm says benefits from the biggest performance increase ever for a Snapdragon update. And that makes a big difference in our Galaxy S10 benchmarks.\nOn Geekbench 4, which gauges overall performance, the Galaxy S10 scored 10,813, the best number we've ever seen from an Android device when we ran that test in the spring. (Subsequent Android phones have since topped that number.) The Galaxy S10 Plus was just behind that number, with a 10,732 result\nThe Galaxy Note 9 scored 8,876 on Geekbench 4, so you can expect a better than 20% improvement no matter which S10 model you prefer.\nThe S10 and S10 Plus also topped the Note 9 when we tested graphics using 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme benchmark. The latest Samsung phones turned in respective scores of 5,606 (S10) and 5,648 (S10 Plus), besting the Note 9's 4,639 result by 21-22%.\nThe S10 Plus enjoys an extra advantage when measuring performance because its base model features more RAM. It ships with 8GB of memory, compared with 6GB in the Note 9's base model. You could upgrade to 8GB in the Note 9, but the S10 Plus's variations include a model with up to 12GB of RAM.\nMORE: First Galaxy S10 Benchmarks: Meet the Fastest Android Ever\nThe S10 Plus comes with the same amount of storage in its base model as the Note 9 \u2014 128GB. And while both phones feature a 512GB option, only the S10 Plus lets you buy a phone with 1TB of storage.\nWinner: Galaxy S10\nBattery\nThe 4,000 mAh battery in the Note 9 was the biggest power pack ever included with a Samsung phone. The operative word there is \"was,\" as the S10 Plus features a 4,100 mAh battery. The S10, meanwhile, gets by with a 3,400 mAh battery.\nGalaxy S10\nThe S10 Plus makes use of its bigger battery, lasting 12 hours and 35 minutes on our battery test, where the phone continuously surfs the web over T-Mobile's LTE network until it runs out of power. The Note 9 lasted for 11:26 on that test, and that was with the phone's adaptive display feature turned off. So you can expect the S10 Plus to last more than hour longer than its big-screen sibling. Still, both devices are on our list of the longest-lasting phones.\nWe can't say the same for the Galaxy S10, which suffers from that smaller battery. It lasted 10 hours, 19 minutes on our test, which is a little better than average for a smartphone.\nThe S10 and S10 Plus boast one power management feature you won't find on the Note 9. The new phones' Wireless PowerShare feature lets you use any S10 as a reverse charger to wirelessly power up other devices \u2014 including the Note 9.\nWinner: Galaxy S10\nSoftware and special features\nThe S10 lineup introduces Samsung's new OneUI skin for Android, which is marked by rounder icons and a redesigned layout meant to make it easier to use large phones with just one hand. That last point is relevant to the S10 Plus and its 6.4-inch screen. Of course, Note 9 users have been able to get the OneUI beta since last year, so they're not missing out on this new interface. And the Android 9 Pie update has been rolling out to the Note 9, bringing that phone in line with the OS version that ships on Samsung's new S10 phones. (That said, Samsung has launched a beta for the OneUI 2.0 interface based on Android 10. The S10 is going to get that update; we're not so sure about the Note 9.\nGalaxy Note 9\nIf there's one area where the Note enjoys a big advantage over the Galaxy S lineup, it's the S Pen that comes with Samsung's phablet. The Note 9 saw a particularly welcome improvement to its stylus, as you can now use the S Pen as a remote control.\nGalaxy Note 9\nBy turning the pen into a remote shutter, you can control music playback or even snap a photo. Even with the improvements to the S10 and S10 Plus, Samsung's latest flagships don't offer anything quite like the S Pen that comes with the Note 9.\nWinner: Note 9\nPrice and availability\nThe S10 Plus is the most expensive phone in the new S10 lineup, with a starting price of $999 for the 128GB model with 8GB of RAM. Upgrading your storage to 512GB or 1TB will set you back $1,249, or $1,599. The S10 is a comparative bargain at $899, with an upgrade to 512GB available for $1,149. We keep tabs on the latest Galaxy S10 deals to see if you can get either new model for less.\n(opens in new tab) Galaxy S10: Samsung's flagship starts at $899 for the 6.1-inch version of the phone. If you want a screen to match the Galaxy Note 9, you'll want the $999 Galaxy S10 Plus.\nThe S10 Plus's asking price is in line with what Samsung charged for the Note 9 when it debuted last August. Then, the base model cost $999, while a 512GB Note 9 cost you $1,249. Prices have fallen since the release of the Galaxy Note 10, though not steeply. Most places charge $899 for the older Note now, though you can get a lower price with a trade-in. Check the latest Note 9 deals to see if there are any chances to save on the cost of this phone.\n(opens in new tab) Galaxy Note 9: The arrival of the newer Galaxy Note 10 means a price drop for last year's Note 9. You can now get that phone for anywhere from $725 to $899.\nSince March, the Galaxy S10 is now widely available \u2014 you can buy it from Samsung, all four major U.S. carriers, regional carrier US Cellular, Xfinity Mobile and retailers including Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart. Several prepaid carriers, including Metro by T-Mobile, Boost and Cricket, now offer the phones, too. The Note 9 has been on sale since last year and remains available at most carriers.\nWinner: Galaxy S10\nBottom line\nThe Galaxy S10 is clearly the better phone than its older sibling, winning every category save for special features where the Note 9 is still tops thanks to that powerful S Pen. We think the Galaxy S10 Plus is the best Android phone you can get right now, and if you like the flexibility that the S Pen has to offer, the more recent Galaxy Note 10 is a better big-screen option than last year's Note. The main reason to turn to the Note 9 is to save a little money.\nThe main takeaway here, though, is just how outstanding the Galaxy S10 is, particularly the S10 Plus, which gives the Note some serious competition for Samsung's big-screen phone of choice. The display is just as large as what you get on a Note 9, you'll enjoy better performance, and the new phone's battery lasts longer on a charge.\nf you're a big-phone fan, you've never had a better range of choices for your next handset. And the Galaxy S10 Plus is hard to beat.",

A fingerprint scanner and a single camera which lacks autofocus sensor are present on the rear shell of the device. The Pixel 3 has dual selfie snappers, but the Lite has only single camera on the front. There is a single speaker and a USB-C port on the bottom edge of the device.

The internal storage of the device is small, but Google will be providing unlimited cloud storage for the buyers of Pixel 3 Lite.\nFor photography, it features OIS enabled single camera of 12.2-megapixel with f/1.8 aperture. As far as image quality is concerned, the source claims that the Pixel 3 Lite can shoot same quality images as the Pixel 3. At the front is a selfie camera of 8-megapixel. It is packed with a 2,915mAh battery.\nGoogle is also expected to debut the bigger Pixel 3 XL Lite along with the Pixel 3 Lite. However, the source did not share any information on the XL Lite variant.

    "https://www.si.com/nfl/2019/03/06/eric-weddle-ravens-cut-released-possible-landing-spots-patriots-steelers-safety-market-earl-thomas": "With a loaded safety market, Baltimore will try their hand at finding a longer-term solution. Who could they target? And where could Weddle play in 2019?\nSince the Super Bowl, I\u2019ve watched film and talked scheme with about 50 NFL coaches. For the second straight year, the only defensive schemes anyone has truly praised are Chicago\u2019s and Baltimore\u2019s. Ravens conversations have been the most abundant. Roughly two dozen coaches\u2014some close to the team, others only familiar with them from afar\u2014marvel at that Baltimore scheme\u2019s aggression and efficacy. And to a man, these coaches have cited Eric Weddle as the key ingredient.\nNo one has said Weddle performs at an All-Pro level. At 34, his speed and quickness have diminished, and he\u2019s no longer the soundest tackler. But his IQ is towering and, more importantly, so is his confidence. That has made him the most daring and creative pre-snap disguise artist in football. His willingness to get out of position pre-snap and change his\u2014or a teammate\u2019s\u2014assignment on the fly gives Baltimore\u2019s defense its trademark deceptiveness.\nThe Ravens tend to play similar six-man matchup-zone coverages from snap-to-snap, but you\u2019re never quite sure who the six zone defenders will be or where they\u2019ll align because you\u2019re never quite sure what to make of Weddle, who moves all over before the snap. This is even truer with Baltimore\u2019s blitz packages.\nThe Ravens, presumably, believe their defense is strong enough to make them contenders in 2019, even if the offense will be adjusting to developmental second-year quarterback Lamar Jackson. Which makes it all the more surprising that Weddle, it\u2019s key ingredient, would be cut in order to save $6.5 million.\nBut a deeper look reveals the logic behind the move. The Ravens, who are young in key spots on both sides of the ball, see themselves not just as contenders in 2019, but contenders for years to come. A smart, versatile safety is vital to their scheme, and Weddle, at this point, might have only a year or two left in the tank. This year\u2019s free agent safety class is unusually deep and, more importantly, unusually top heavy.\nIt might not be coincidental that Weddle\u2019s release came after the Giants officially let Landon Collins hit the market. Tyrann Mathieu and LaMarcus Joyner are also available. Like Weddle, Mathieu and Joyner are versatile enough to play back deep or in the box. And, unlike Weddle, both can slide down and cover the slot. Also, there\u2019s Adrian Amos, who played in a disguise-heavy scheme in Chicago. The physically gifted Ha-Ha Clinton-Dix is also a disguise player (though some of that\u2019s by accident, as he\u2019s mastered the art of wandering out of position\u2014still, Clinton-Dix is talented). There\u2019s also Earl Thomas, who can drop into the box but is more of a pure centerfielder. Stylistically, Thomas is still the closest thing the NFL has had to Ed Reed since Ed Reed himself. One imagines the Ravens, especially, can appreciate that.\nBy releasing Weddle, most likely the Ravens are not trying to save money at safety, they\u2019re priming to spend money there long-term (not unlike they did when signing Weddle\u2019s sidekick and close friend, Tony Jefferson, two years ago). Any of the safeties listed above can be inked to five-year deals. (Yes, even Thomas, who will only be 30 on Opening Day.) Those safeties will also get up to speed quickly, since they have meaningful NFL experience and will be playing for defensive coordinator Wink Martindale, whom Ravens coaches say is one of the best teachers they\u2019ve ever seen.\nAs for Weddle himself, the question is, Where will he play in 2019? His weaknesses are now an issue. As several coaches explained, Weddle\u2019s game is built on smoke and mirrors. He wins by playing with crafty leverage. He can no longer survive in man-to-man or be fully trusted in space. Baltimore\u2019s uniquely aggressive scheme hid these flaws while accentuating his strengths. That would not be the case in a traditional scheme.\nThis might be why Weddle said two months ago, via the Baltimore Sun, \u201cIf [the Ravens] want to go in a different direction, I\u2019m not going to play for another team. That\u2019s not where I\u2019m at in my career.\u201d He has since changed his mind.\nSo where would he play in 2019? The same rich safety free agent class that got him released in Baltimore will suppress his value on the open market. What might help his value is that more and more teams are playing with three safeties instead of just two.\nBefore joining Baltimore, Weddle reportedly almost signed in New England, and Greg Bedard of the Boston Sports Journal has suggested that would be a good marriage. Contrary to popular belief, New England\u2019s D is not immensely complex or aggressive like Baltimore\u2019s. The Patriots blitz sparingly and their coverage disguises ask players to cover small bits of ground, not large swaths of field. But the Patriots do put their safeties in favorable position, often aligning one in deep centerfield and the other over the middle, where he\u2019s a free help defender or QB-reader. That type of role plays to Weddle\u2019s football IQ and masks his limitations.\nOther teams that could use and could fit Weddle include:\nGiants: Weddle would be a cheap replacement for Landon Collins. Their defensive coordinator, James Bettcher, is perhaps football\u2019s most aggressive blitz designer, with most of those blitzes being built on disguise.\nBears: The last thing a Super Bowl-caliber defense wants is a glaring hole, which is what the Bears face at safety if Adrian Amos is not re-signed. If new coordinator Chuck Pagano stays close to what predecessor Vic Fangio did, Weddle could be hidden by a scheme that hinges on two-deep match-zone principles, where defensive backs almost always have some sort of help in coverage.\nBroncos: Fangio will be running his scheme in Denver (obviously). The Broncos believe their defense alone can make a deep playoff push now\u2014that\u2019s why John Elway hired a 60-year-old head coach and traded for a veteran starting quarterback in Joe Flacco. The biggest key to Fangio\u2019s scheme is the subtly of its coverage disguises. Those disguise tactics aren\u2019t easy to learn\u2026 unless you\u2019re Eric Weddle.\nLions: Matt Patricia is running the 200-level version of New England\u2019s scheme. Weddle could help push the D to level 300 or 400.\nBucs: New defensive coordinator Todd Bowles plays the way Bettcher plays with the Giants. Tampa Bay\u2019s incumbent safeties are so-so. Bowles might want more athleticism here, but we\u2019ve seen a hundred coaches in his position before eventually say, \u201cScrew it, just give me a guy who knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\nSteelers: Because they\u2019re so weak at linebacker, they badly want a dime safety who can play in the box, allowing either Jon Bostic or Vince Williams to leave the field. Ex-Packer Morgan Burnett can be that guy, but injuries made him a week-to-week mystery last year. Weddle isn\u2019t a box player, but second-year safety Terrell Edmunds could slide there, with Weddle playing back deep. Plus, the Steelers wouldn\u2019t mind a veteran who has intimate knowledge of their rival Ravens.\nTitans: They\u2019re coached by Weddle\u2019s former Ravens defensive coordinator, Dean Pees, and they\u2019ll be looking for safety help with Jonathan Cyprien soon to be released and Kenny Vaccaro a free agent.\nAll of these teams need the type of immediate help at safety that Weddle can provide. It will be fascinating to see how this market play out.\n\u2022 Question or comment? Email us at talkback@themmqb.com.",
    "https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2470529/gotham-finale-trailer-check-out-all-the-characters-flash-forward-looks": "Spoilers ahead for the penultimate episode of Gotham's fifth and final season on Fox.\nThe fifth and final season of Gotham is very nearly finished, and the penultimate episode was the end of an era that saw Jim Gordon become commissioner, Bruce Wayne head off for the next leg of his Bat-journey, two of his biggest future rogues recommitted to their villainous paths, and more. Even baby Barbara Gordon got to be decked out in her future Batgirl colors. Gotham as we knew it is done, and the series finale next week will be something brand new.\nThe finale flashes forward ten years, which allows Gotham to finally reveal its Batman without putting a teenager in the cape and the cowl. Prepare yourself for some of the last Gotham footage you'll ever get to see and check out the trailer:\nThe Gotham series finale, fittingly called \"The Beginning...\", will apparently see some kind of fancy party or gala, as many of the characters can be spotted in formalwear. The episode picks up ten years after the end of the penultimate episode that saw Bruce depart Gotham, with no sign of when he might want to return. He's finally coming home due to the opening of the new Wayne Tower, which only took a decade to rebuild after he and Selina blew it up to delay Bane.\nSince this is Gotham, there will be some bonkers twists to guarantee that the opening doesn't go off without a hitch. A series of crimes leads Gordon to suspect that his old frenemies Penguin and Riddler are back in the crime game. Bullock will be framed for murder, and the episode description states that \"Gordon begins to piece together an even more sinister plot targeting the city.\" Based on the trailer, I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that Jeremiah has something to do with it!\nFans still have several days to wait before getting to see the series finale; fortunately, the trailer combined with some episode photos have revealed the new looks of a bunch of characters following the flash-forward. Keep scrolling to see what has changed and what hasn't in the ten years between the end of the penultimate episode and the beginning of... well, \"The Beginning...\"\nSome characters -- like Lucius, Lee, and Harvey -- actually basically look the same, but others get a seriously updated appearance. Let's start with the good guys.\nJim Gordon Gets A Mustache\nIn the trailer footage, Jim Gordon looks about the same as he always has. Kudos to him for aging well, but he loses points for not getting a little creative over the past decade. Still, one of the photos released for the finale reveals Jim with a good old-fashioned Commissioner Gordon mustache. He apparently won't have the mustache for all or perhaps even much of the finale, and it looks less creepy than the mustache from Bruce's dream sequence.\nWill the mustache be part of Jim's look at the beginning of the episode, and he shaves it off, thus giving comics fans a nod to the iconic Commissioner Gordon facial hair? My money is definitely on him with the 'stache at the beginning rather than the end. Considering Ben McKenzie's tease of the final scene of Gotham and Gordon's lack of facial hair in what appears to be that scene in the trailer, I'm guessing he doesn't end with it.\nBarbara Went Red\nBarbara Kean has gone through many hairstyles throughout the years. The long blonde hair from her time as Jim's fiancee was chopped short in future seasons. Barbara's hair got crazier and bolder the longer that she spent working with the baddies of Gotham City. She was looking to spend her time on the right side of the law after she discovered she was pregnant in Season 5, so perhaps Sirens has a redhead running the joint without crossing any lines.\nHonestly, for Barbara, I'm guessing that Gotham gave her a redheaded look for the grand finale to explain why her daughter presumably is a redhead. If Babs Gordon takes after the many Babs Gordons who have appeared on the pages of DC Comics and in most adaptations, then she'll have red hair. Could one of Gotham's finale twists be that Barbara has been a natural redhead all along, and only dyeing her hair red? Whatever the reason, Barbara is looking snazzy for the finale.\nAlfred Is Up And At 'Em\nAfter Alfred got his back broken by Bane in a twist on an iconic comics plot, fans had reason to wonder if he was going to be down for the count for the rest of the series. Bane wasn't exactly pulling his punches when he smacked Alfred's spine against a pole, and I can still hear the crunch. Still, Alfred was on his feet, although not looking his best by the end of the penultimate episode.\nThe finale proves that the ten years since his back was broken gave Alfred plenty of time to get back to his dapper old self, although he is still walking with a cane. Still, for a guy who spent a decade recovering from a horrific injury, dealing with the absence of the young man he considers the only son he'll ever have, and rebuilding both a mansion and a skyscraper into his 60s, he looks pretty great. Besides, he can probably do some serious damage with that cane.\nSelina Kyle Gets Catty\nAlthough the trailer for the series finale doesn't give any close looks at Selina's face, it's probably safe to assume that the cat burglar in all black is good old Selina Kyle. There's really no single image from the trailer that does justice to Selina's efforts to rob what appears to be a museum or store with serious security messages, but Selina in motion proves that she's upped her game in the years since Bruce bailed on her.\nHer new look is pretty sleek, and she seems to favor a helmet or a cowl of her own to contain her hair. It looks like she still has the whip, and the clawed gloves are coming in handy in her criminal exploits. Honestly, the young woman deserves some credit for pulling off that backflip in those heels. Would it be too much to ask for a sequence of Batman trying to chase after Catwoman before the final credits roll?\nThe Dark Knight Rises\nYes, the long-awaited debut of the Dark Knight is on the way. Bruce's journey from scared orphan who watched his parents gunned down in an alleyway to young man willing to sacrifice anything if it means saving lives will finally result in him donning the cape and the cowl. Whatever happens during his ten years away from Gotham, he'll be ready to seize his destiny.\nUnfortunately, the ten-year jump that will allow Bruce Wayne to be ready for Batman doesn't also mean actor David Mazouz gets ten years older. Still, Gotham found a way for Mazouz to play Batman despite not being quite big enough just yet to fill the Bat-suit, so the man behind the mask won't be a stranger. Batman's origin story will really, truly, finally produce a Batman! Here's a closer look at the cowl:\nIs it too soon for me to say that I'm excited for this scene? We'll have Batman, a kinda sorta Bat-Signal, and the trio of Jim Gordon, Alfred, and Harvey Bullock looking on. I fully expect it to be one of the most memorable scenes of the series, and possibly give us our closest look at Gotham's Batman. It's too dark to see many Bat details just yet, so we can only hope that it's as great as we've had five seasons to count on.\nBaby Batgirl Is No Longer A Baby\nOnce upon a time, it seemed all but impossible that Jim and his crazy ex Barbara could get together to make the future Batgirl, but Season 5 really found a way to make the wild idea of a baby Barbara Gordon come true. Born in the final episodes before the flash-forward, the closest look at baby Babs so far came from the ceremony where Jim was named commissioner, when she was wearing her little purple and black dress with the yellow bow.\nNot-so-baby Babs in the trailer is still wearing at least one of the signature Batgirl colors, but the footage doesn't show her face or much of her hair to reveal if my redhead theory is correct. All we can really say about 10-year-old Barbara Lee Gordon is that she wears her hair in pigtails, chose a purple sweater that day, and likes to hug her dad. That's enough for now!\nNow, on to the bad guys!\nPenguin Gets An Eye\nPoor Penguin lost an eye in the penultimate episode of the series, after a grenade thrown by Bane shot some shrapnel into his face. The trailer shows that he does get his right eye back -- or at least, a right eye -- somehow, and that's not the only thing he'll add to his face. Penguin is finally getting the monocle that most iconic versions of the character wear at some point or other.\nHis whole look is practically straight from the pages of the comics, aside from the fact that Gotham's Penguin didn't gain a whole lot of weight in the ten-year flash-forward. Robin Lord Taylor didn't have to spend his final episodes as Penguin in a fat suit! He does have the top hat in at least part of the episode, but he loses it at some point. Hat or not hat, he looks like the perfect Penguin.\nRiddler Gets His Question Marks\nEd got a green suit shortly after he made his turn into The Riddler, and he certainly looked spiffy in his green jacket... when he wasn't waking up confused after being used to do dastardly things by the mind control chip in his brain. After his grand speech about no longer being a common criminal in the second-to-last episode of Gotham, Ed has upgraded his villain look. The Riddler has his question marks!\nAnd also a sweet pair of glasses with a green tint that probably isn't too functional but adds a certain flair. His glasses are green, his shoes are shiny silver, his tie has question marks, and the result is that we have a classic Riddler look who strikes quite a villainous figure. Honestly, seeing the new looks for Riddler and Penguin just makes me want a spinoff all about their exploits together all the more.\nJeremiah's New Look Is Super Creepy\nWell, Gotham made us wait all the way until the series finale to see Cameron Monaghan's final new look as Jeremiah Valeska, but it looks like the wait will be worth it. Although this trailer doesn't actually show much of him, another preview showed him in all his creepy, Joker-esque glory. His delightfully unnerving cackle is heard, however, and the footage is enough to reveal that he breaks out of Arkham, presumably with the help of none other than Ecco.\nHonestly, Jeremiah doesn't look that bad considering he was dumped in mysterious acid, and it didn't look like anybody was exactly rushing to fish him out. All signs pointed toward him never recovering. Good for him, I guess? As for Ecco, she's looking much spiffier than Jeremiah, although no less bonkers.\nEcco Still Looks Like Harley Quinn\nGotham may never have delivered Harley Quinn herself, but Ecco definitely fit the bill just as much as Jeremiah fit the bill for the Joker, and she'll get one more episode to show off why she's such a dangerous ally for the madman.\nThe trailer shows her having infiltrated Arkham, presumably to spring Jeremiah from the clink and unleash him on the city again. Ecco will apparently pay a visit to Sirens on top of Arkham, and it should be fun to see what she gets up to before the final credits roll.\nTune in to Fox on Thursday, April 25 at 8 p.m. ET to catch the series finale of Gotham.",
    "https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2471686/the-time-emilia-clarke-pretty-much-spoiled-daenerys-targaryens-ending-on-game-of-thrones": "SPOILERS AHEAD from Game of Thrones Season 8, Episode 5. Also WARNING: Toward the end of this post, I'm gonna rant like a mofo about Dany's TV character development.\nGame of Thrones just Dracarys-ed the hell out of Daenerys Targaryen's storyline as a hero of the game. In Season 8, Episode 5, \"The Bells,\" the Breaker of Chains ignored the King's Landing bells signalling the city's surrender. She and Drogon instead covered King's Landing in fire and blood -- not just the soldiers, but thousands of innocent people. No matter what happens in the May 19 finale, there's no coming back from that.\nIt was quite a change of pace for the fire-loving dragon queen who had never before turned her Dracarys powers on civilians completely out of the game. Tyrion Lannister used wildfire to kill thousands and win the Battle of the Blackwater and Arya Stark killed off an entire House, but in context those kills -- and Dany's previous kills, even the Tarlys -- could all be fairly explained, keeping our heroes on the right side.\nBut now?\nEmilia Clarke knew this was coming, of course. She got the final season scripts and filmed them, and she shared multiple hints along the way that Dany's story would take a dramatic turn for the worse.\nOne fan dug up a pre-Season 8 ET interview Emilia Clarke did with Nathalie Emmanuel (Missandei) and Jacob Anderson (Grey Worm), showing Emilia dying to say what she really thinks:\nET: Have you shot your final scenes yet [nods from cast] and are you happy with how things ended?Nathalie Emmanuel: Yes.[Emilia Clarke cringe-smiles and nervous-laughs.]ET [pointing to Emilia]: She didn't say yes. You didn't say yes.Emilia: Best season ever!\nOoh, but you have to watch how she says it. It's pretty clear she did not think it would be the best season ever:\nSee more\nIt reminded me of Michael Scott on The Office:\nOr the Chrissy Teigen cringe smile:\nProps to Nathalie Emmanuel for staying spoiler strong there, even though Missandei was killed off last week. She could've joined Emilia Clarke in cringe-laughing but instead kept a straight face and stayed loyal to the show.\nI'm with Emilia, though. And that interview was not the only time she gave fans a hint that Dany's storyline would go south.\nRemember a year ago, when Emilia Clarke was asked about filming Dany's final on-screen moment? Here's what she had said to Vanity Fair about that:\nIt fucked me up. Knowing that is going to be a lasting flavor in someone's mouth of what Daenerys is.\nThat unsettling reaction was a big hint that Dany would go out in a negative way.\nEmilia Clarke joked about it again after the airing of Episode 5, saying on Instagram she needed a lot of liquor to get through the May 12 episode (the only episode so far this season with a \"rotten\" score, by the way):\n(opens in new tab) A photo posted by on\nGame of Thrones has never been a show that cares about fan service, but it should care about character consistency.\nThat's why so many Dany fans (especially book readers like myself) are pissed off at the showrunners for the past couple of seasons, but especially the writing of Season 8. Dany's Season 8 story took a dramatic turn from the woman who always stood up for the people, and never wanted to be the queen of ashes. They even had her begging Jon not to tell anyone about his lineage. They made her weak and desperate, something very far from Book Dany and also foreign to most of HBO Dany's story. Imagine if the situation were reversed and Jon started slaughtering innocent people. Fans would rightfully be confused and frustrated at such a huge character change.\nJust because she got mad doesn't mean she had to go mad. But Game of Thrones decided to go hard on The Mad Queen angle in Season 8. Instead of just letting her be as ruthless as Arya or Tyrion when it counts -- something she had shown the whole time, and why she was able to win so many good people to her side -- they decided to tip her scales to madness.\nDany deserved better than to be lumped in with her abusive brother Viserys and their father The Mad King just because they are Targaryens. (Meanwhile, Rhaegar, who dumped his wife and kids for Lyanna Stark, is somehow \"noble\"? OK.) Jon is a Targaryen too, but no one calls him out on anything he's done -- or not done, since he's become one of the most passive characters -- or decides it's because of his dragon blood.\nI know not everyone agrees. That's the beauty of a show like Game of Thrones. It inspires strong opinions, but not the same strong opinions. Some fans think Dany has been going mad the whole time in a steady progression. Others just never liked her. We were warned that fans would have divided opinions on the final season, depending on various characters' fates. So be it.\nGame of Thrones' final episode ever airs this Sunday, May 19 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO. And then we can spend the rest of our lives debating it like the Lost finale (I actually liked that ending, gods save me), the Dexter finale (actually is there a debate there or do we all agree that one sucked?) and The Sopranos finale.",

After 2 installments of our round table discussion about Miami-FSU, we now come to the piece you\u2019ve been waiting for: our predictions. Before we get there, let\u2019s go back.\nHere\u2019s part 1 of our round table:\nHere\u2019s part 2 of our round table:\nAnd now, here are our predictions:\nPrediction time. How do you see the game playing out?\nCam Underwood: I\u2019ve said this all week long, and even a while before that referring to last year\u2019s Miami-FSU game: if you put up anonymous stat profiles for these teams and asked people to choose a winner and winning margin, people would unanimously choose the Miami-profile team to win by 21+ points.\nBUT, when you put names on the teams, and consider the rivalry nature of this game, things aren\u2019t as clear as the profiles on paper might lead people to believe.\nI don\u2019t think that FSU can block Miami\u2019s defensive line, and their offense won\u2019t be able to get going because of that. And with Miami playing a new QB, one who is accurate and has the arm to take advantage of the receivers I believe will be running open all day long, and plenty of skill position talent to exploit the already-seen holes in FSU\u2019s defense, I don\u2019t think this game ends up being all that close.\nFinal Score: Miami 38 Florida State 20\nEvan Hadrick: I think the defense makes some plays early and just makes HRS goes nuts. FSU then falls apart and returns to early season form. Miami 34 - FSU 13.\nMatt Washington: Miami holds off FSU, wins the turnover battle and ultimately come out on top. Final Score: MIA 30-FSU 24\nJohn Camera: I think it\u2019s going to be all Miami through 2.5 quarters before FSU creeps in to make it a game. Perry has a turnover or two but ultimately, FSU\u2019s comeback falls short. 30-21 Miami.\nGaby Urrutia: I can see this being a game, at least for a little bit. Emotions will be high and I would not expect Florida State to just roll over and let us dog them. I do, however, expect the game to finish with Miami on top and the score being lopsided. I believe the Hurricanes defense is as hot as any unit in the country and Florida State is in the line of fire. There is nothing that Willie Taggart can throw at Manny Diaz that he isn\u2019t ready for.\nI believe Perry can make the throws that were open all game last week for Louisville and Miami can impose their will on the weak secondary that Florida State has put together.\nFinal Score: Miami 38 Florida State 17\nMarshall Thomas: I see it being very close in the first half, and both teams struggling to score early, maybe Miami 10-6 at half. However, I think Perry strings together a few scoring drives in the third quarter, and then a pick by Francois will open the floodgates where FSU can\u2019t recover from. Miami wins 31-13.\nDylan Sherry: I see Miami winning, but not as much as they\u2019re favored by. My score prediction is Miami 31-24. I see Miami giving up 24 points due to the fact that FSU\u2019s offense will guard better than they have all season, in addition to the that fact that the \u2018Canes have bent but not broken to some teams -- I expect the FSU game to go in a similar way. The \u2018Canes defense will give up yards, but stiffen up when they need to. If Malik was starting, I\u2019d go with the \u2018Canes winning 28-24, but I think Perry will lead them to victory, and end up getting the extra score that Miami needs in order to end the game in the victory formation.\nKevin Fielder: I think this game will be closer than most think. I think Miami takes an early 10-0 lead after an N\u2019Kosi Perry touchdown pass to Michael Harley and a short field goal. However, I think the Seminoles offense begins to gain speed and take a lead going into halftime at 13-10. In the second half, I think the Hurricanes prove to be too much for the Seminoles and the experienced players on both ends (Travis Homer, Jeff Thomas, Shaq Quarterman, Joe Jackson) begin to control the line of scrimmage and dominate the game. I have the Canes winning 31-16 with a big performance from N\u2019Kosi Perry (270+ yards and 3 touchdowns) and the offense in the second half\nCraig T. Smith: Can you believe it\u2019s been since September 2004 that Miami has won at home against FSU? That was a month before I became a lawyer, and it feels like I\u2019ve been one for a lifetime. It\u2019s time for UM to ditch this curse and continue to make Hard Rock Stadium a special place for the Canes. Dallas and Travis Homer pace an offense that gets the Canes into the upper 20s, the defense thwarts a late Nole drive and Miami wins a tight one 28-24.\nAnd there you have it. Our picks for Miami-FSU.\nYou have picks too, so share them in the comments below. And, who knows, there may even be a gift for the person closest to the actual score. Maybe.\nGo Canes",

As the off-duty FBI agent flips, the gun is seen falling off from the man's holster onto the floor. The man is then seen jumping quickly to pick up the gun, but as he picks it up, he appears to fire the gun by accident.\nSome people in the crowd scatter for safety as others look in disbelief. The man then appears to put the gun in the back of his pants and is seen holding his hands up before walking away from the shot.\nA man was hit by the bullet in the lower leg and was taken to the hospital, where he was listed as having non-life threatening injuries.\nThe agent was taken to Denver Police Headquarters and later released to a FBI supervisor. The incident is being investigated by the Denver Police Homicide Unit and charges will be determined by the Denver District Attorney\u2019s Office, the police spokesperson said.",
    "https://thevikingage.com/2018/09/01/minnesota-vikings-final-2018-roster-cuts/": "The Minnesota Vikings trimmed their roster down to 53 players on Saturday and the list of cuts included a number of notable names.\nThanks to some early moves on Friday, the Minnesota Vikings made trimming down their roster to 53 players a little easier on Saturday. However, the Vikings still had to part ways with a number of talented guys this year.\nFor the players cut on Saturday, Minnesota will hope to sign some of them to their 10-man practice squad this season. But a number of guys let go by the Vikings also have the talent to sign on with another NFL team this year.\nSaturday\u2019s roster moves even came with a big surprise from Minnesota. Tough decisions are part of the business of today\u2019s league, but it doesn\u2019t make it any easier for fans when they see the Vikings letting go of some of their favorite players.\nDepending on who else gets released around the NFL, Minnesota could still possibly cut more guys before their first game of the regular season next Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers. But who were the 23 players the Vikings officially decided to part ways with on Saturday?",
    "https://www.nrl.com/news/2019/03/26/manly-warringah-sea-eagles-v-new-zealand-warriors-round-3-preview/": "The return of Tom Trbojevic can't come soon enough for Manly and Daly Cherry-Evans needs to start firing.\nThe Sea Eagles also lost, but they finished the game strongly against the Roosters and might feel like they learned something about themselves.\nAfter a good first-round home win over the Bulldogs, the Warriors weren't able to stick with the Tigers last week at Campbelltown and crashed to a heavy loss.\nStrange as it may seem, winless Manly might actually go into this Saturday afternoon encounter with more momentum and confidence than the Warriors.\nWarriors: A few late alterations, with Isaiah Papali'i elevated to the starting lineup in the back-row and Adam Blair shifting to lock. Lachlan Burr drops to the bench and Gerard Beale moves from the reserves to the bench. Blake Ayshford and Liligiifo Sao were cut an hour before kick-off, while Chanel Harris-Tavita and Karl Lawton dropped out of the squad on Friday.\nSea Eagles: Manly will take to the field as named on Tuesday. Sea Eagles fans will be delighted to see fullback Tom Trbojevic back from an ankle injury, while prop Addin Fonua-Blake returns from suspension for Toafofoa Sipley, who moves to the bench. Brendan Elliot and Kelepi Tanginoa were the last players cut prior to kick-off, while Trent Hodkinson and Lloyd Perrett dropped out of the squad on Friday.\nKey match-up\nCherry-Evans and Blake Green were teammates at Manly before Green moved on to the Warriors. Both players have a lot on their plate every week for their teams to be successful but that comes with the territory of being starting playmakers in the NRL. Their respective contributions on Saturday are crucial to the outcome.\nFor the Sea Eagles to win\nThey can't have a repeat of last week when the game was effectively over at half-time. The forwards need to assert themselves against the hot and cold Warriors pack, while Cherry-Evans and Kane Elgey need to step up and take control.\nFor the Warriors to win\nWhen the Warriors cut the Tigers' lead to 12-6 early in the second half it looked as the game could've gone either way. But the Tigers turned up the heat and the visitors didn't have it in them to fight on. An 80-minute effort is vital on Saturday and they need their experienced leaders to take charge.\nBrett Kimmorley says ...\nI\u2019m not too sure where Manly can go on the back of being blown off the park last week and being poor in week one. They really need a good first 40 minutes When you are down on cattle you need to start well, lead, and then go from there. The Warriors would have their pride hurt after last week. With this game being in Christchurch there will be a lot of emotion, that will mean a lot. The game has to be played between the ears, that is the biggest deficiency for the Warriors. Warriors by 8\nSea Eagles Stat Attack\nCurtis Sironen is equal-second in the NRL in off-loads (7), while Apisai Koroisau has been busy in defence with 93 tackles (equal-second). On the down side Cherry-Evans is equal-second in handling errors (4).\nWarriors Stat Attack\nMistakes and poor options hurt the Warriors in the 34-6 loss to the Tigers. They completed just 67% (22/33) of their sets and had 14 errors - twice as many as the Tigers.\nAnd another thing ...\nIt's fair to say Blake Green is a rugby league journeyman, but the 32-year-old playmaker has carved out a very respectable career. Green is with his sixth NRL club and also had stints with two English Super League clubs. He played with the Sea Eagles in 2017 and would love to get a win over his former teammates.",

The team reportedly intends to deal with this problem by signing a second kicker to the active roster.\nWith veteran kicker Caleb Sturgis nursing a strained quad, the Chargers are signing free agent kicker Mike Badgley, league sources tell @FieldYates and me. Sturgis will not be cut, however, as the Chargers will carry two kickers on their active roster. \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) October 11, 2018\nMike Badgley has never attempted a field goal during a regular season NFL game. He played for the University of Miami during his college career and was mostly successful. He converted on 25 of 30 field goal attempts as a sophomore, 21 of 26 as a junior, and 17 of 23 as a senior. Those numbers are not impressive, but they are passable.\nOne hesitates to say they hope the Chargers do not need to use the rookie kicker because Sturgis has been so unreliable, but one hopes the Chargers do not need to rely on him this weekend. It is impossible to know what Badgley might do in his first taste of NFL experience, but hopefully, if he gets it with the Chargers, he will find success.",

Romelu Lukaku opened the scoring at Vicarage Road with a bundled finish from Ashley Young\u2019s cross after 35 minutes. Chris Smalling then showed a delightful touch in the box to double the advantage, chesting and volleying past Ben Foster just three minutes later. Watford, who boasted four wins from four matches ahead of kick-off, hit back through Andre Gray in the second half but couldn\u2019t find a way back onto level terms and maintain their unbeaten record.\nExpress Sport has run the rule over the Manchester United players during their latest win, but do you agree with these ratings? Manchester United player ratings vs Watford \u2013 Premier League GK: David De Gea \u2013 6 One stunning save from Troy Deeney kept the scores level before United found the breakthrough. A late stop from Christian Kabasele was another demonstration of his worth to the team, although he will be disappointed to miss out on a clean sheet yet again. RB: Antonio Valencia \u2013 5 Still too slow with his decision making in the final third but always sticks to his guns defensively. CB: Chris Smalling \u2013 8 Has established himself as the first-choice centre-back at Old Trafford, displaying more leadership than has been seen in recent season. Then popped up at the other end with masterful control and a thumping finish to double United\u2019s lead.

Provided the cross for Lukaku\u2019s goal, and generally kept Will Hughes quiet. CM: Paul Pogba \u2013 8 Involved in a private battle with Ben Foster, bringing the best out of the Hornets goalkeeper on two separate occasions in the first half. Looks at his best when striding forward in possession, and the team selection let him do that. CM: Marouane Fellaini \u2013 9 Preferred over Fred as United opted for greater physicality in midfield, and the Belgian ace didn\u2019t disappoint. Involved in both goals and looks one of Mourinho\u2019s more reliable players, despite still being unpopular among fans. Also provided an effective defensive shield and deserves to start again next week. CM: Nemanja Matic \u2013 5 With Fellaini in the holding role, Matic was undoubtedly neat and tidy but somewhat redundant. Similar to his time at Chelsea alongside N'Golo Kante, the Serbian needs to offer more offensively if he is going to justify his selection. Then demonstrated ill-discipline to pick up a second yellow in injury time.\nMarouane Fellaini was instrumental against both Watford and last time out against Burnley\nRAM: Jesse Lingard \u2013 6 One delightful cross to Pogba that should have been finished, and used his movement to open up space for others. LAM: Alexis Sanchez \u2013 4 Still working to recapture his best form, with the Chilean often looking frustrated at both his team-mates and himself for failing to meet his high standards. Worked Foster with a fierce drive but looks a shadow of his former self. ST \u2013 Romelu Lukaku \u2013 7 Benefited from Fellaini\u2019s selection and picked up the pieces after his team-mate caused carnage in the box, bundling home with his midriff.

When the leader of that gang re-emerges many years later, she must work her way back through the remaining members and into her own history with them to finally reckon with the demons that destroyed her past.\nWhat do critics say about Destroyer? The neo-noir thriller directed by Karyn Kusama has received a respectable 71 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes. The critics' consensus reads: Destroyer's gruelling narrative is as uncompromising as Nicole Kidman's central performance, which adds extra layers to a challenging film that leaves a lingering impact. Jake Coyle for Associated Press: While \"Destroyer\" can be overwrought and mechanical, it's an often gripping, well-crafted crime drama with a distinction of its own in the genre, an almost always male-dominated one. Rafer Guzman for Newsday: \"Destroyer\" is a worthwhile film, especially for moviegoers who love film noir in all its phases: The hard-boiled Bogart era, the nihilist takes of the 1960s and '70s, the neon-lit productions of the '80s. VICE REVIEWS: WHAT DO CRITICS SAY ABOUT DICK CHENEY MOVIE?\nDestroyer: The Nicole Kidman thriller has a positive 71 percent on Rotten Tomatoes\nGary M. Kramer for Salon.com: Despite the film's uneven qualities, \"Destroyer\" is compelling because of Kidman's unflinching performance. The actress appears in every scene, and it's impossible to take one's eye off her. She exudes a fierce determination that is alluring. Peter Travers for Rolling Stone: Nicole Kidman, playing a burned-out LAPD cop, proves she's as an actress who knows how to stay the course, no matter how twisty, tangled or down and dirty it gets. She's dynamite. BUMBLEBEE REVIEWS: WHAT DO CRITICS SAY ABOUT THE TRANSFORMERS PREQUEL?\nManohla Dargis for the New York Times: Kusama is still figuring out how to balance form and pulp, but she has a singular unapologetic idea about what women can and cannot do onscreen, one she lets rip with verve and her superbly unbound star. Mark Kennedy for Associated Press: It's been a while since we've had a Los Angeles on the screen like this one. Rachel Leishman for The Mary Sue: Destroyer is hands down the best work Kidman has done yet, unafraid of inhabiting this incredibly raw character-one who is trying to understand pain in a new way, and it's definitely a movie you don't want to miss. IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK REVIEWS: WHAT DO CRITICS HAVE TO SAY?\nDestroyer: Critics were over-all pleased with the movie by Karyn Kusama\nSara Stewart the New York Post: The particulars of the story are typical for the genre - a heist gone wrong, a slippery crime boss - but they're elevated to visceral levels by Kidman's hard-core performance... Bilge Ebiri for New York Magazine/Vulture: Kidman's performance as this broken, obsessed woman is powerful. Breathless, rasping through her teeth, she conveys both vulnerability and intractability. April Wolfe for TheWrap: Despite the film's needlessly fractured structure and a relentlessly grim story, Kidman and Kusama seem to be speaking the same language, illuminating the faults of the protagonist and of every tragic hard-boiled detective in cinematic history. Linda Holmes for NPR: Rarely are women cast in these roles of screwed-up, hard-boiled antiheroes with a lifetime of regrets to make up for, and even if this is your basic LA noir, it's well-executed and satisfying in all the ways it should be.\nDestroyer: Nicole Kidman (L) with director Karyn Kusama (R) have been praised for their work",

The date of Eid al-Adha, said to be the holier of the two Eids, is also dependant on the lunar calendar each year. Eid al-Adha falls on the tenth day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the 12th and final month in the Islamic calendar. In the international solar Gregorian calendar, the dates drift about 11 days earlier each year.\nThe dates of the upcoming Eid al-Adha are determined by the moon sighting, applied on the 29th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar. However, the sighting of the new moon will vary between countries, so the exact date depends on local religious authorities. In Saudi Arabia, the date of Eid al-Adha determines the date of Hajj. This year, local news has reported that the crescent was sighted, making Sunday, August 12 the first day of the 12th month and August 21 the first day of Eid al-Adha.\nEid 2018: Hajj is an annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia\nWhat is Hajj? Hajj is an annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, the holiest city for Muslims. It is a mandatory religious duty for Muslims, that must be carried out one in their lifetimes by all adults who can physically and financially undertake the journey. It is one of the five pillars of Islam, along with Shahadah (belief in the oneness of God and acceptance of Muhammad as prophet), Salat (prayer), Zakat (charity) and Sawm (fasting). The Hajj is a demonstration of the solidarity of the Muslim people, and their submission to Allah.\nHajj: Muslims gather atop the mountain during the Day of Arafat\nWhat date is Hajj 2018? Hajj begins on the eighth day of the Dhu al-Hijjah, so is also dependant on the moon sighting. This year, it is due to commence on August 19, and will continue until August 24. On the tenth day then, Eid al-Adha will commence and those on the pilgrimage will observe the festival. This is the day when an animal will be slaughtered in honour of the prophet Ibrahim.\nEid 2018: Last year, about two million Muslims travelled to Mecca for Hajj.",

Heyman claimed that his client was unhappy with the fact that he is not in the main event and he will go to Las Vegas, hinting at rival wrestling promotion All Elite Wrestling, to look for something better. But that promo seems to be entirely kayfabe so there was probably a different reason behind the strange call.

Each year there is a theme, with a strong focus on remembrance and learning from the past. The Holocaust Memorial Day also pays tribute to those who died in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur.\nHow to mark Holocaust Memorial Day Each year thousands of activities take place for HMD, bringing people from all backgrounds together to learn lessons from the past. Activities are organised from schools to libraries, workplaces and local authorities.

    "https://wccftech.com/msi-x570-gaming-motherboards-amd-ryzen-3000-cpus-leak/": "The latest round of AMD X570 chipset powered motherboards has leaked out by Videocardz and this time we are looking at the MSI lineup for Ryzen 3000 series processors. With Computex just a few days away, more leaks and teasers for the next-gen X570 boards have started appearing on the web.\nMSI X570 Motherboards Pictured, The X570 Gaming Pro Carbon and The X570 Gaming Plus For AMD Ryzen 3000 CPUs\nThere are at least two motherboards which are revealed by Videocardz and both utilize the AMD X570 chipset. There would obviously be more motherboards in the new AM4 lineup for 3rd Gen Ryzen processors but right now, let's talk about the two pictured today.\nMSI X570 Gaming Pro Carbon Motherboard\nStarting off with the higher-end MSI X570 Gaming Pro Carbon, we are looking at what seems to be a 12 phase VRM which should deliver some really good overclocking results on the upcoming AMD Ryzen processors. The AM4 socket is powered by an 8+4 pin connector configuration and there are the MSI DDR4 Boost and Core Boost technologies that should automatically tune up clocks from within the BIOS. There are four DDR4 DIMM slots that can support up to 64 GB of DDR4 memory. Supported clock speeds aren't mentioned but we have seen up to 4000 MHz OC+ memory support on BIOSTAR's X570 Racing GT8 motherboard so we should expect higher memory clock support on the Gaming Carbon.\nStorage options include 6 SATA III ports and dual USB 3.0 front panel headers. Expansion includes two PCI-e 4.0 x16 slots (x16/x8 electrical), two PCI-e 4.0 x1 slots and two M.2 slots (PCI-e 4.0 x4). The full-length PCI-e slots are shielded by metal brace while the M.2 slots are covered by heatsinks that extend from the main PCH heatsink. The motherboard has wireless (WiFi+BT) capability which has been indicated by the source.\nMSI has there Dragon theme and carbon textures all across the motherboard and we can also see active fan cooling on the PCH which is a common theme for all X570 motherboards we have seen so far. The MSI X570 Gaming Carbon seems to have solid I/O and a metal fin heatsinks along the CPU VRMs and a great looking I/O panel cover with RGBs that are compliant with MSI's Mystic Aura lighting technology.\nMSI X570 Gaming Plus Motherboard\nMoving on to the MSI X570 Gaming Plus, we are looking at a slightly toned down design with standard aluminum heatsinks that are placed over what looks to be a 6 or 8 phase VRM supply. Power to the socket is supplied through an 8+4 pin connector configuration and we can spot the whole red and black aesthetics across the motherboard. Storage options include 6 SATA III ports while expansion slots include two PCI-e 4.0 x16 (x16/x8 electrical), three PCI-e 4.0 x1 and two M.2 slots. The motherboard also features the active fan cooling on the PCH heatsink which looks to be of the same design as MSI's AERO series graphics cards.\nThe MSI Gaming Plus (X470) was priced under $140 US so we can see that even the entry-level X570 boards require active PCH cooling which could highlight slightly higher thermals than the existing X470 and X370 PCH.\nAMD's Next-Gen X570 Chipset \u2013 A New House For Ryzen 3000 Series CPUs\nAs we saw with X470, there were a few features for the Ryzen 2000 series processors which were only supported by new motherboards such as Precision Boost Overdrive and XFR 2.0. There\u2019s no doubt that AMD\u2019s Zen 2 based Ryzen mainstream processor family would come with new features but the main highlight would be support for PCIe Gen4. The X570 platform will be an all PCIe Gen4 solution, which means this would most probably be the first consumer platform to feature support for the new PCIe standard.\nThat, however, doesn\u2019t mean that AMD Ryzen 3000 series would only be compatible on X570 boards since just like last time, the new CPUs will be backward compatible with X470 & X370 boards too. Following are links to the respective motherboard manufacturers BIOS release for existing motherboards to support 3rd Gen AMD Ryzen CPUs:\nThey certainly won\u2019t display the same feature set that will be available on the newly launched X570 lineup but will feature fully stable functionality for users who just want to drop in a new CPU and continue using their PCs without the hassle of upgrading the motherboard and everything from scratch. Expect more to hear at Computex 2019 which commences on 27th May 2019.",
    "https://wccftech.com/samsung-galaxy-note-9-iphone-x-oneplus-6-benchmarks-performance-specifications-iphone-lead/": "In its customary style, Samsung pulled off a fantastic event to launch its second flagship mobile gadget in 2018, the Samsung Galaxy Note 9. The company made some impressive changes to the device, as it chose to focus on specific user needs and experience instead of a new design and look for the gadget. Samsung also upgraded the Galaxy Note 9's S-Pen, which now has a battery and can carry out tasks such as snap photographs or control the device's volume.\nAdditionally, we also got two important performance upgrades in the form of a variant with 8GB of RAM and increased battery capacity for the Galaxy Note 9. As tests and analysis of the gadget start, one thing that several folks will like to hear about is benchmarks. Well, if you're one of them then we've got just the post for you today. Take a look below for more details.\nSamsung Galaxy Note 9 Compared To The iPhone X, OnePlus 6 & Other Gadgets In Benchmarking Run\nWhile there's a great amount of debate, with some solid arguments in favor of the fact that benchmarks do not reflect real-world performance, they still demonstrate how well a device's core performance statistics such as the GPU and CPU will perform, especially under strenuous workloads.\nWith that in mind, we've got some of the first benchmarks for the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 today which don't paint a rosy picture for the device. Folks over at TomsGuide have carried out a handful of tests for the smartphone, running on 6GB of RAM. As a result, we've got two performance and two supplementary tests today.\nSamsung Galaxy Note 9 Vs iPhone X Vs OnePlus 6: GeekBench 4 And 3D Mark Results Show Clear Lag For The Note 9\nThe first two tests related to performance. We've got GeekBench 4, which focuses on holistic performance rather than segments. In the test, Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 scores 8,876 points - which are in the ballpark of what one would expect from the Snapdragon 845. The iPhone X and the OnePlus 6 on the other hand score 10,357 and 9,088 points respectively, making for a clear lead on the iOS device. Additionally, the OnePlus 6 in the test is running on 8GB of RAM, so the Note 9 and the device are pretty much on par.\nMoving towards 3D Mark Slingshot Extreme 3.1, the Galaxy Note 9, iPhone X and OnePlus 6 scored 4639, 4994, and 5124 points respectively. While the OnePlus 6 and iPhone X are somewhat in the same ballpark, the Note 9's score is more on par with the Samsung Galaxy S9+, which manages to score 4634 points,\nSamsung Galaxy Note 9 Vs iPhone X Vs OnePlus6: Display Tests Demonstrate Relatively Stronger Performance By The Note 9\nA display brightness test for the Galaxy Note 9 reveals that the device has a peak luminosity of 604 nits, considerably greater than the iPhone X and OnePlus 6 which score 547 each. However, in this metric, the Galaxy S9+ and LG's G7 ThinQ top out the Note 9, managing to score 630 and 900 nits in light output.\nFinally, the Galaxy Note 9 tops the iPhone X in color percentage, managing to capture 224% of sRGB against the iPhone's 128.6%. The OnePus 6 and the Galaxy S9+, on the other hand, capture 240.3% and 231% of the spectrum respectively.\nTo conclude looks like the Note 9 is a device that will provide you with the same level of performance as other flagship devices, but using it will not result in an extraordinary experience.

    "https://wccftech.com/review/the-walking-dead-the-final-season-ep-2/": "Game Info The Walking Dead: The Final Season - Episode 2 September 25, 2018 Platform PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch Publisher Telltale Games Developer Telltale Games\nThe Walking Dead: The Final Season was supposed to be the beginning of a new chapter for Telltale Games. Following a series of so-so releases and damning reports about working conditions at the studio, Telltale changed up their leadership and pledged to refocus and give The Walking Dead the sendoff it deserves. And it seemed like Telltale was going to deliver on their promise \u2013 The Walking Dead: The Final Season Episode 1 was a gripping return to form for the studio.\nAnd then it all went to hell. Late last week, Telltale unexpectedly announced they were closing their doors and cancelling all future projects. Telltale has yet to specifically spell it out, but word is The Walking Dead: The Final Season won\u2019t receive a proper conclusion. But Telltale did send out review codes for The Final Season Episode 2 just days before they pulled the plug, and thus I find myself in the slightly odd position of reviewing a finale that wasn\u2019t intended to be a finale. So, is this episode worth playing, or will it leave Telltale and Walker fans feeling dead inside?\nWarning: This review contains spoilers for The Walking Dead: The Final Season Episode 1.\nOn the previous episode of The Walking Dead: The Final Season, Clementine, now around 16, and her adopted son AJ were rescued and taken in by a group of teens who had set up camp in an abandoned boarding school. Being around kids her own age allowed Clem to finally let her guard down and it seemed like she and AJ had found a permanent home. Of course, this being The Walking Dead, something sinister was going on at the school \u2013 it turns out the kids\u2019 leader, Marlon, had secretly traded two members of the group to a band of raiders. When one of the other kids confronted Marlon about this, he lashed out, accidentally killing her. This was witnessed by Clementine, who got locked in a cellar with Marlon\u2019s zombified victim for her trouble. Clem survived and told everybody what Marlon had done, but, in a classic weasel move, he tried to pin it on her. Unfortunately, AJ decided to settle the argument by putting a bullet in Marlon\u2019s head. Cue Episode 2\u2026\nThe boarding school gang aren\u2019t thrilled about their leader\u2019s skull being ventilated, even if he was kind of a jerk, and so they vote to expel Clementine and AJ. Once out on their own, they quickly run afoul of the raider group Marlon did his dirty deal with, who just so happen to be led by somebody from Clementine\u2019s past. No spoilers, but Telltale went all the way back to Season One to unearth this character. A conflict ensues, during which AJ is shot, but, thankfully, our heroes are saved at the last minute by James, a former member of the Whisperers, who survives amongst the walkers by wearing a human skin mask. According to (the surprisingly hunky) James, the raiders are looking to forcibly recruit the kids at the school into their army, so Clem heads back to the school to get medical attention for AJ and warn them about the attack. With doom hanging over their heads, everybody agrees to let murderous bygones be bygones and begin preparing for the raiders\u2019 attack.\nThe Final Season Episode 1 told a simple story focused on character development and a more disturbing, psychological brand of horror. Episode 2, by comparison, is all about plot. Longtime fans of The Walking Dead may appreciate the callbacks to earlier Telltale seasons and references to the comics, but, ultimately, this episode just isn\u2019t as interesting as the first. It feels a bit padded, with a sequence in the school\u2019s greenhouse feeling particularly wedged in and contrary the previous episode\u2019s setup (why would these kids who are so concerned about maintaining a safe zone leave a bunch of walkers wandering around in a glass house on school grounds?) Also, if you\u2019re at all familiar with any iteration of The Walking Dead you\u2019ve probably already seen battles like the one at the end of this episode play out multiple times.\nThe Final Season Episode 2 isn\u2019t without its high points though, most of which come when it gets back around to the character-driven stuff. The \u201cpost-apocalyptic parenting sim\u201d feel of the first episode has been dialed back a bit, but there are still some downright heartbreaking scenes between Clem and AJ. The game asks you to consider what you would do if somebody you loved did something horrible \u2013 would you empathize with the victim/society, or is it family above all? A difficult question at the best of times, but an almost impossible one when the perpetrator is an adorable 5-year-old boy. In addition to the AJ stuff, there are also further hints there may be some romance in Clem\u2019s future, with the game allowing you to engage some cringe-worthy (in a fun way) teen flirting.\nUnfortunately, while this episode\u2019s writing is solid enough, it\u2019s action scenes take a turn for the worse. Episode 1 largely deemphasized action, but Episode 2 makes up for that with a boatload of quick-time events and a particularly annoying, glitchy walker-shooting sequence. Yeah, the action stuff is still easy enough to muscle through, but it was easier to ignore in the previous episode.\nThe Final Season Episode 2 lasts your standard 2 to 3 hours, and then it\u2019s done. Anybody hoping Telltale might have added something to the episode at the Eleventh Hour to provide fans with some closure are out of luck. The episode ends on a typical Walking Dead final page cliffhanger, except this time the next \u201cissue\u201d will probably never come. Dreadful sorry, Clementine.\nThis review was based on a PC copy of The Walking Dead: The Final Season Episode 2 provided by publisher Telltale Games. You can purchase the Season for Xbox One or PlayStation 4 via Amazon, for PC via Green Man Gaming.\n7 Wccftech Rating The Walking Dead: The Final Season - Episode 2 The Walking Dead: The Final Season - Episode 2\nAs a middle chapter of what was supposed to be a four-part series, The Walking Dead: The Final Season Episode 2 gets the job done just fine. It gets a bit bogged down in plot, but still delivers some moving scenes and interesting new and returning characters. As possibly the final statement of one of the best narrative video game developers of all time, it's a crushing disappointment. Here\u2019s hoping the remainder of The Walking Dead: The Final Season can somehow rise from the grave.",

Additionally, it grants owners access to an exclusive set of weekly challenges, which are crucial to levelling up the Battle Pass and getting those cosmetics quicker. While it's normally possible to buy one Battle Pass with real money and earn enough from it to buy the following seasons (and so on from there), this enables you to save the V-Bucks you earn from the Battle Pass and spend them on skins or other cosmetics on the Fortnite shop.\nA variety of Overtime Challenges are now available, so you can get started on working towards that free Fortnite Season 8 Battle Pass.

While the first of the month marked the arrival of most of the month's non-Netflix originals, the remainder of April is primarily focused on Netflix's own content--and, sadly, the deadline has passed to watch what was the service's best animated show. Star Wars: The Clone Wars has departed from Netflix, but there's still a whole lot else to watch. Here's a rundown on the on the month's arrivals and departures.\nAs of April 1, Netflix has released plenty of new movies, including Freddy vs. Jason, Pineapple Express, and the classic sci-fi movie The Fifth Element.

The viewer watches Grylls try to survive in some of the world's harshest environments, and their decisions could help him.

    "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-update-out-now-here-are-the-patc/1100-6460669/": "A new update is live for Rainbow Six Siege primarily focusing on balancing changes and bug fixes. The update launched first on PC before also coming to Xbox One and PS4. Called Patch 2.2, the update makes several gameplay changes.\nThe first change affects how players deploy drones. Instead of immediately pulling into the drone camera's view upon deployment, players will have the choice between Standard and Advanced views. For Standard, the player's view changes to that of the drone upon deployment. For Advanced, the player's view remains with their Operator after throwing out a drone, and drone view will have to be manually switched to.\nPlayers also can now choose their preference for how they rotate through their team's Observation Tools. For Defenders, there are groups of Observation Tools, divided between the main collection of cameras and the groups of specialized cameras assigned to specific Operators, like Valkyrie. Before, Defenders rotated through all the cameras as one large group. Players can still do that if they prefer, or change their settings so the switch between different Observation Tool groups is manual instead of automatic.\nUbisoft is also rolling out the first few Operator and item balancing changes outlined in the company's Designer's Notes. We've highlighted the major ones here, but the full list of changes and bug fixes can be found on Ubisoft's Rainbow Six Siege blog.\nBalancing Changes\nFinka\nReduce ability duration from 20 seconds to 10 seconds\nStun grenades will be replaced with Frag grenades\nReduce Smoke\u2019s Gas Canister damage modifier\nAim down sights modifier from Adrenaline Rush reduced from -50% to -25%\nIQ\nFrag Grenades replaced with Claymore\nElectronics detection reduced from 20m to 15m\nBlackbeard\nIncrease MK17 damage from 42 to 49\nReduce SR-25 damage from 72 to 61\nReduce the hit points on the Rifle Shield from 60 to 50\n30% reduction in movement speed penalty when the Rifle Shield is equipped (He will move faster)\nGlaz\nReduce OTS-03 damage from 85 to 71\nTwitch\nReduce FAMAS damage from 40 to 37\nJackal\nIncrease footsteps scanning distance from 5m to 8m\nFrost\nIncrease SMG damage from 43 to 45\nIncrease Super 90 damage from 32 to 35\nDokkaebi\nClaymore will be replaced with Stun Grenades\nBarbed Wire",
    "https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-dragon-prince-season-2-review-slowly-pick/1100-6465051/": "The Dragon Prince Season 2 is out now on Netflix. Have you watched both seasons? What do you think of the improved animation quality? Which characters are your favorite? Let us know in the comments below, and read on for our review!\nThe Dragon Prince is a show that started strong, but left a lot to be desired given the short length of its first season. It introduced an intriguing world and some fun characters, but spent so much time establishing its lore that the plot took a back seat until the last few episodes. Season 2 turns out to be much the same: Once again, after a slow, but promising start, The Dragon Prince seems like it will finally start gaining some momentum--next season, that is.\nWhen we last saw Prince Callum, Prince Ezran, and the elven assassin Reyla, they were on the run from the kingdom of Katolis to return the magical dragon egg when it suddenly hatched. Hot on their trail were Claudia, a dark magic user, and Soren, her bone-headed brother who intended on returning the two princes back home against their will. It was an action-packed finale to what was otherwise a slow burn of a first season, and while Season 2 picks up immediately after, it feels like the show immediately hits the brakes, focusing on establishing character motivations as opposed to pushing the plot forward.\nWhile that\u2019s certainly a disappointment, it\u2019s not such a bad thing this time around. With another set of nine episodes focused on more buildup, almost every character was given a chance to begin a unique arc for themselves. Callum, for example, dealing with the repercussions of breaking the Primal stone, cannot cast magic anymore and struggles with whether or not he\u2019ll turn to the dark arts to compensate. Ezran, a child himself, must act as the main guardian of the recently hatched dragon, Zym, while he reels from the news that he is next in line to become king. They don\u2019t make too many strides forward in their quest to bring Zym back to his mother, but they make up for it with character growth that sets up their goals and challenges for the seasons to come.\nExtra attention was even given to some of the side characters as well, in particular the siblings, Claudia and Soren, who were tasked with tracking down the two princes last season. We spend a good amount of episodes with them, which is fantastic because their chemistry together rivals that of the main characters. Soren is still as burly and brash as ever, but time is taken to show us a bit more about what drives him to be the best, while Claudia begins to face the repercussions of her proclivity with dark magic. Viren, the main antagonist of the series so far, also gets mixed up in his own side story, showing us his insecurities and reasons for wanting to go to war with the elves. There\u2019s some disturbing implications that come with it, and considering the season begins with Aunt Amaya literally smacking two elves into a pit of lava, I can\u2019t wait to see if the show will continue to get darker.\nOne highly requested (and much needed) change to The Dragon Prince was adding more frames of animation to its quieter, dialogue focused scenes. While it could still use some work, I\u2019m happy to say that there isn\u2019t one scene this time around that reminded me of the sometimes borderline stop-motion animation that plagued the first season. Fight scenes are still as exciting and creatively choreographed as ever, and just like last season, scenes of serenity give us some beautiful vistas showcasing the lush world these characters inhabit. Just like the first season, it wasn\u2019t uncommon for me to pause the show and just stare at some of the visuals. Its sense of humor is still very much intact as well, occasionally catching me off guard with that trademark Avatar: The Last Airbender-esque humor.\nThere are a couple of issues lingering on from the first season that continue to hold the show back, however. Ezran is still an extremely underdeveloped character. He\u2019s given more to do this season, which helps, but he\u2019s still criminally underused as one of the show\u2019s three main characters. His contributions to conversations usually amount to no more than naivete as a form of comic relief, and don\u2019t give any insight into his feelings until the last episode. That grievance can be amplified by some of actor Sasha Rojen\u2019s dialogue delivery as well, which sometimes comes off as flat. On that same note, Reyla, who arguably experienced the most growth in Season 1, was given very little to do this time around. She gets into all the fights and can clash with the best of them, but we already knew that about her. While I can respect that her spotlight was taken away to give other characters a chance to shine, it\u2019s a shame the only thing we learn about her this season is that she\u2019s working on overcoming her aversion to boats.\nWhile there have been missteps here and there while The Dragon Prince begins its journey, I can\u2019t fault it too much this time around considering the amount of care the writers are putting into each character. When the first season ended, I wasn\u2019t sure whether or not I would be excited to continue watching because it wasn\u2019t quite enough to get me fully invested. While I\u2019m still patiently waiting to see where the story takes the characters, I can\u2019t wait to see where the characters will take the story. Yes, it\u2019s disappointing that the characters have barely gotten any closer to completing their goal, but the quality time we spent with them this season was anything but filler. With battle lines being drawn and allegiances tested, everything is poised to fan the flames of the plot. It still hasn\u2019t taken off quite yet, but when The Dragon Prince returns, I\u2019m confident it will soar.",

The iconic art-style from Akira Toriyama (Dragon Ball, Chrono Trigger) was on full display, and we had a taste of the localized English voice acting.\nEarly in the game, you'll arrive at the city of Heliodor, where the main character Hero is referred to as a \"Luminary\", which is a common class title in past Dragon Quest games. Hero is sent to jail by King Carnelian, who seems to have a vendetta against luminaries, believing they're conspiring with darkness.\nDragon Quest XI comes to PlayStation 4 and PC worldwide on September 14, 2018, while the Nintendo Switch version does not have a release date yet. Pre-orders are now open and there will be two separate editions of the game. The game launched in Japan for PS4 and Nintendo 3DS in July last year and sold extremely well, with over three million units sold in a four-month period.",

Check out all the Fortnitemares challenges to see what you need to do to get them.\nUpdate 6.20 and the Fortnitemares event also introduce a PvE element to the game. \"During Fortnitemares, you\u2019ll face off against Cube Monsters in a whole new way of playing Battle Royale,\" Epic explains. \"There are new weapons to fight back against these creepy creatures, like the Six Shooter and Fiend Hunter Crossbow.\n\"Take out the Cube Fiends and Fragments to pick up loot, and survive against enemy players.\" Interestingly, Fortnitemares seems to blur the line between the Battle Royale mode and Save the World mode by giving players zombie-like enemies to fend off.\nYou can see the other changes, additions, and tweaks that have been made to Fortnite this week by reading the update 6.20 patch notes.",

Unsurprisingly, the statement claimed the Huskers were ready and willing to make it work and the Zips were the ones who backed out.\nOn Sunday evening, Akron released its own version of events and \u2026 basically confirmed what Nebraska had been saying. Athletic director Larry Williams released a statement that included talk about the inability to secure accommodation in and around Lincoln.\nWilliams added that the only accommodations they would have been able to get would have split the team up. Apparently having the team in multiple locations would have not been \u201cin the best interests of our team.\u201d\nAkron AD Larry Williams releases a statement explaining why Akron chose not to stick around.

That would mean a week 14 matchup.\nWilliams made it clear that so far the talks have only been if the teams need another game in order to become bowl eligible. It\u2019s not clear if Akron would agree to travel all the way to Lincoln if they had week 14 free but didn\u2019t need it to try and get to a bowl.\nIf other reports are accurate, it would appear the Zips have the Huskers between a rock and a hard place. Those reports state the contract between Nebraska and Akron made the money the Cornhuskers offered to play the game, guaranteed once it kicked off.\nIf that\u2019s the case, then it\u2019s a monumental good to have allowed the game to start, considering the weather that was already in the area. The game was delayed and eventually canceled immediately after the opening kick.\nAkron could now ask for an additional payout in order to make a return trek to Lincoln.

He held the potent Red Raider offense to just five hits and walked none.\nThough both teams had their chances in regulation, the starting pitching and bullpens delivered time and time again. Four relievers combined to strike out 19 Red Raiders across 14 innings of work, with each reliever working around jams via the K. The first run to score came in an unusual way; Johnny Rizer singled and advanced to third with two outs, bringing up Conner Shepherd. Shep struck out, but strike three was dropped, and as the Tech catcher went to throw him out and end the frame, apparently the turf monster got him:\nNot how it was drawn up but... Frogs lead!!

But the game continued when the Red Raiders doubled home a run - initially ruled out, the play was overturned on review.\nA pair of scoreless frames followed until the Frogs finally got some breathing room in the 14th, when TCU loaded the bases thanks to singles by Conner Shepherd and Adam Oviedo preceded a Bobby Goodloe walk. Zach Humphreys took his place in the batter\u2019s box with two down and the bags packed, and delivered a two run double to make it a 3-1 ball game.\nTech didn\u2019t go quietly in the bottom of the inning, putting the tying runs on with one out. But Augie Mihlbauer struck out the final two batters he faced to give the Frogs a dramatic W.\nWith the victory, TCU Baseball moves to 29-21 overall and 11-11 in Big 12 play. The Frogs and Texas Tech face off in game two tonight, with first pitch scheduled for 6:30 on FSSW+.",

It\u2019s crazy,\u201d Clarkson told cleveland.com Monday afternoon. \u201cI was like, \u2018Man, it felt like somebody took my family member from me.\u2019 That\u2019s what it felt like. This is a whole thing, man. It\u2019s just embarrassing to us. It\u2019s just crazy, man. Crazy stuff.\u201d\nThe 33-year-old Grammy-nominated West Coast rapper was known for his reality-based lyrics and work in the South Los Angeles community. He had developed an interest in technology and community development, and was part of a team of artists and entrepreneurs who developed Destination Crenshaw, an open-air museum devoted to honoring African-American artistic achievement.\nAccording to TMZ, Nipsey was supposed to be meeting with LAPD brass Monday to discuss ways of preventing gang violence.\n\u201cHe\u2019s so important to the culture and it\u2019s detrimental in terms of that,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cIn terms of everything, you have a black man that\u2019s doing good for himself no matter his past or whatever he had done. In his own neighborhood, started his own business, had his own thing going and he gets shot on a Sunday. It\u2019s almost embarrassing to our culture and to us as people that we would do something like that.\n\u201cIt does hurt because I feel like he has touched all of us in many ways. Then even people bringing their phones out and recording him while he\u2019s on the ground and stuff like that, it\u2019s a lot. We just have to change as people to be honest with you. I don\u2019t see no other races doing that. We definitely have to change as people. We just need to look in the mirror.\u201d\nClarkson said he only met the rapper, born Ermias Asghedom, a few times. Nipsey Hussle frequently sat courtside at Staples Center for Lakers home games. The two talked \u201chere and there\u201d and exchanged pleasantries on Twitter.\nBut the talented rapper still made a profound impact, which became more clear by the outpouring of messages and condolences.\n\u201cFeel like he\u2019s the 2Pac of our generation to be honest with you,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cSame impact. He has that much pull on people. You see how much in terms of people showing love.\u201d\nEarlier this year, Nipsey\u2019s long-awaited debut studio album, \u201cVictory Lap,\u201d earned a Grammy nod for best rap album. It featured lyrics about surviving street life, including fighting off would-be robbers. He collaborated with Kendrick Lamar, CeeLo Green, Diddy, The Dream and YG on that album.\nOne of the tracks, \u201cGrinding All My Life,\u201d was used in Isaiah Thomas\u2019 documentary titled \u201cBook Of Isaiah,\u201d while chronicled Thomas\u2019 trade from Boston and return from injury.\nClarkson\u2019s favorite track, \u201c7 Days a Week,\u201d came from Nipsey\u2019s \u201cThe Marathon\u201d mixtape. Earlier this season in Los Angeles, Clarkson got a tattoo on his lower leg of deceased rapper Pimp C. Asked if he will pay tribute to Nipsey Hussle with some ink the same way, Clarkson said \u201cI don\u2019t know yet. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\u201cHe was a real dude,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cHe always kept it honest. Even when he started his stuff to everything, he kept it real.

John Kasich to, ironically, raise money for Planned Parenthood in Ohio.\nKlausner wrote on Twitter that she began receiving random criticism and insults on social media on Wednesday after Fox News picked up her airplane story, which has been reported on by cleveland.com and other media outlets.\nShe responded by turning the tables on her conservative critics, saying she would donate $1 to Planned Parenthood of Ohio for each comment she received on Twitter and Instagram. She also launched a GoFundMe page, which she named \u201cTrolls for Planned Parenthood.\u201d\nI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t donate any money to women\u2019s reproductive freedom this morning, Susan! NOT! Thanks for the contribution. https://t.co/4GXXgv3B0P \u2014 Julie Klausner (@julieklausner) January 30, 2019\nKaisch is opposed to abortion, and has signed a number of laws restricting abortion access in Ohio (although shortly before leaving office in January, he vetoed a bill that would outlaw abortions when a fetal heartbeat is detected) while Klausner, a political liberal, says she supports women\u2019s right to choose to have an abortion.\nKlausner subsequently posted PayPal receipts showing donations she\u2019d sent to Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio.\nThanks to all of your mentions-- from trolls and supporters alike-- I've raised and donated just under 3K this morning for Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio. I'll continue to donate one dollar for each hateful tweet I get going forward. Thank you, and John Kasich sucks. pic.twitter.com/NxGqD1atrC \u2014 Julie Klausner (@julieklausner) January 30, 2019\nIn total, Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Sarah Inskeep said, the organization believes Klausner and her story have resulted in almost $5,000 being donated to Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, as of Wednesday afternoon. The organization is having a difficult time tracking the exact amount because some is going to the national Planned Parenthood organization while some has been sent to the Ohio affiliate, Inskeep said.\n\u201cThe active Go Fund Me page has been live only a few hours and is trending positively, raising thousands of dollars for our health centers,\u201d she said in an email.\nTo recap, Klausner first wrote of her interaction with Kasich on Jan. 16, when she posted on social media about Kasich getting her seat on an Alaska Airlines flight. As she told it, Kasich\u2019s seat had been taken by a co-pilot at the last minute, and rather than moving out of first class, Kasich took her seat. Klausner said she then agreed to take a different flight rather than prolong the confrontation.\nKasich has said through a spokesman that there was \u201cconfusion\u201d after the airline assigned a pilot to his seat, and that he\u2019s sorry that someone lost a seat.\nKlausner described the story in greater detail on Friday, using colorful and sometimes profane terms to describe Kasich\u2019s behavior, in her personal podcast. Cleveland.com summarized the Kasich story, as told on her podcast, in a story on Monday.\nSince that story published, it has been the second-most popular article on cleveland.com, as of Wednesday afternoon. Much of that traffic has been driven by shares on social media.\nRepublicans and Democrats alike seem to be enjoying the negative attention Kasich has received. Among those who have shared the story is Bob Paduchik, an Ohio political operative and Kasich critic who left a top position with the Republican National Committee in January to join President Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign.",

Speaking without notes, he explained his vision for Indonesia and also gave the floor to his running mate to speak.\nBut his speech was criticised for repeating the key messages on his campaign materials.\nDespite the negative reviews, Mr Widodo was praised for being more courageous in his rebuttals.\nSeveral times Mr Widodo responded to his opponent saying, \"don't just accuse, give evidence, and lodge an official report\".\nBut many Indonesians were left disappointed when both candidates failed to fully address key issues such as military involvement in combatting terrorism, the controversial ITE law, and the status of the Corruption Eradication Commission.\nThere has been some speculation the two candidates agreed to stay away from controversial human rights issues.\nHowever, Usman Hamid from Amnesty International Indonesia said the efforts of the two candidates need to be appreciated.\nThere is speculation the two presidential candidates agreed to stay away from controversial human rights issues.

    "https://news.sky.com/story/game-of-thrones-review-explosive-episode-paves-way-for-big-finale-11719131": "Warning! This article contains spoilers for Game Of Thrones season eight, episode five, The Bells.\nWell. In the end, the bells for peace tolled, but Daenerys Targaryen was having none of it.\nThe deaths of Missandei and Rhaegal in last week's episode did indeed prove to be the straw that broke the dragon's back, finally transforming the once benevolent Khaleesi into the feared Mad Queen who had not-so-subtly been promising to unleash herself throughout this entire final series.\nJon Snow may not want The Truth, but he sure got to find out what happens when The Truth comes out.\nIf The Long Night was the most breathtaking episode of season eight visually (the long dark gripes aside), The Bells was the one that had your heart in its grip from the beginning and never let go.\nGrittier, rawer and perhaps a little less Hollywood, this was bigger than the battle against The Night King and a far more emotionally charged war. Because that was clear-cut, good versus evil; this time, the good turned evil and set the world on fire.\nImage: Arya Stark amid the destruction. Pic: HBO/ Sky Atlantic\nWith so much to tie up, so little time, there will undoubtedly be certain scenes, deaths and questions from this penultimate episode that will divide fans. But for sheer exhilaration, The Bells delivered. This is what Game Of Thrones is all about.\nKing's Landing incinerated\nWith two dragons down and just one left, there had been much speculation about how Daenerys would fare against Cersei Lannister's bigger and less battle-weary army.\nAdvertisement\nWith Rhaegal taken out so quickly (and conveniently) by Euron Greyjoy, would this fight to be more evenly matched than on paper? The answer was a resounding no.\n:: Listen to the Backstage podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker\nGetting to grips with Drogon after infuriatingly retreating from Greyjoy and faffing about with Jon during the Great War before that, the Mother Of Dragons finally showed that swords and spears and massive crossbows are no match for great balls of fire, and not before time.\nIt quickly became apparent that who would win the Last War was never in question, with Drogon obliterating anyone standing in Dany's path.\nOh, if only she'd thought to do this last week! Maybe BFF Missandei would still be alive and there would be no need for all this.\nThis had become about vengeance, and when Cersei's soldiers waved the white flag, Dany carried on, incandescent with rage; destroying King's Landing and killing the thousands of innocent people she had once vowed to rule over peacefully.\nGoodbye, Cersei and Jaime\nThis was the episode where the mask dropped and we saw Cersei, the frightened mother-to-be, desperate to protect her unborn child as her city collapsed around her.\nReunited briefly with Jaime, she was reduced to tears as King's Landing fell. Yes, she's a monster and deserved everything coming, but you couldn't help feeling sorry for her as that rarely seen vulnerable side came out.\nAs the walls caved in around them, the star-crossed twins/lovers died in each other's arms in an ending that will no doubt enrage fans who wanted to see revenge served cold and torturously (to Cersei, obviously, but also to Jaime, who we can't forgive for breaking Brienne's heart).\nBut actually, this was a fitting end. Cersei didn't die battling for the throne and proudly standing up to her enemies, she died helpless and weak - her biggest fear.\nImage: It's goodbye Cersei. Pic: HBO/ Sky Atlantic\n'Someone has betrayed me'\nThe episode started with Varys, foreseeing his death it seems and committing Jon's secret to paper.\nSure enough, Dany quickly ordered his execution by dragon fire, setting the tone for what was to come.\nIf that wasn't enough for lovestruck Jon to have a polite word with the woman he has bent the knee for, surely the destruction of King's Landing and its people will be?\nCome on, Jon! Varys did warn you, mate.\nWith just one episode left, sadly the time for polite words has passed; now is the time to be the hero we have known and loved in seasons before. We know you've got it in you, even if you have been a bit rubbish this series.\nThe Night King is gone. Cersei is gone. The question now is about the final battle for the Iron Throne: now he's witnessed the full scale of her penchant for burning people alive, will the last war be between Jon and Dany?\nCleganebowl\n\"Hello, big brother,\" said The Hound, in the biggest TV reunion since Sharon witnessed the resurrection of Dirty Den.\nThis was the moment Game Of Thrones fans had been waiting for: The Hound versus The Mountain, and it didn't disappoint.\nSwords clanged as the brothers fought to the bitter end, with the superhuman and super-gruesome Mountain surviving everything his brother could throw at him, even a knife straight through the head.\nAs it looked like the Hound was about to become another of his poor eye-crush victims, little brother locked his grip and pulled them both from a wall and down to a fiery death below.\nArya: She's only human, after all\nBefore his death, the Hound and Arya Stark shared their goodbyes.\nAfter arriving in King's Landing announcing her intention to kill Cersei, once the city started to fall the Hound was quick to point out to Arya that continuing with him meant certain death.\nAfter slaying the Night King and becoming the hero of Winterfell, and turning down Gendry's proposal to pursue her quest for killing, the young assassin had become almost robotic in her search for vengeance.\nBut the Hound's words resonated. \"You think you've wanted revenge a long time? I've been after it all my life, it's all I care about, and look at me. You want to be like me? You come with me, you die here.\"\nSuddenly, she was little Arya Stark again. \"Thank you,\" she whispered as she turned to flee, the understanding that this was farewell as the Hound left to meet his fate.\nImage: Many are killed in the inferno. Pic: HBO/ Sky Atlantic\nBrotherly love\nBefore his death, Jaime also had a poignant reunion with his other sibling, Tyrion.\n\"If it weren't for you, I never would have survived my childhood,\" Tyrion told his brother. \"You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had.\"\nIt was an emotional scene.\nTrying to do the right thing, Tyrion betrayed his queen and freed Jaime from capture, wanting to save him and also believing he was the one who could bring about peace.\nHe knew his fate should Daenerys find out.\n\"Tens of thousands of innocent lives, one not particularly innocent dwarf,\" he said. \"Seems like a fair trade.\"\nIn the end, Tyrion was the last Lannister standing.\nAnd finally\u2026\nViewers who kept up with other fan favourite Line Of Duty will have spotted a familiar face in King's Landing this week.\nDetective Inspector Michelle Brandyce, who popped up in the final episodes of the police drama, had inexplicably hot-footed it from AC-12 to Westeros.\nWhat's worse, you wonder: bent coppers and an OCG, or angry dragons?\nSadly for the DI, it turned out to be the dragons, and she met a fiery end along with her young daughter.\nOh, Ma'am. When DI Kate Fleming told you to \"stop making a t*t out of yourself and p*ss off\", I'm not sure this was quite the punishment she had in mind.\nSo this is it. The end is nigh.

    "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/26/politics/north-korean-embassy-madrid-fbi-spanish-judge/index.html": "Washington (CNN) A shadowy North Korean dissident group claimed responsibility for last month's raid on Pyongyang's embassy in the Spanish capital, Madrid on Tuesday but disputed allegations that what occurred at the diplomatic compound was an \"attack\" involving armed intruders.\nCheollima Civil Defense, a secretive organization whose goal is to overthrow the Kim regime in North Korea , also denied that any other foreign governments were involved in the operation or that it was related to President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un's summit in Hanoi, which occurred days later.\n\"This was not an attack. We responded to an urgent situation in the Madrid embassy. We were invited into the embassy, and contrary to reports, no one was gagged or beaten. Out of respect for the host nation of Spain, no weapons were used. All occupants in the embassy were treated with dignity and necessary caution. There were no other governments involved with or aware of our activity until after the event,\" a statement released by CCD said.\n\"We have evidence verifying our account. It is to protect those who seek our help, and those who take great risk to protect others, that we cannot share more about the event at this time. We continue to be engaged in extraordinarily sensitive work around the world,\" it added.\nThe statement was released hours after a Spanish judge said Tuesday that the FBI was contacted by one of the alleged intruders who carried out last month's mysterious raid on the North Korean embassy in Madrid and offered stolen data taken during the brazen attack.\nJudge Jos\u00e9 de la Mata lifted a secret decree on the investigation into the February 22 attack, providing \"an account of what happened before, during and after the assault,\" according to a document from Spain's High Court\nThe alleged incident, was carried out by 10 people who the judge says identified \"themselves as members of an association or human rights movement for the liberation of North Korea.\" The court document does not specifically name CCD.\nFive days after the attack, the FBI was contacted by the group's alleged leader, a US resident, \"in order to provide information regarding the incident at the Embassy, \u200b\u200bas well as the audiovisual material allegedly obtained\" during the raid, the document says.\n\"In addition, he stated that, under his own will, he carried out the events together with a group of unidentified persons,\" it adds.\nThe judge also said he believes the identified intruders, which include American and South Korean citizens, traveled to the US after the attack.\nState Department deputy spokesperson Robert Palladino said Tuesday that the US government \"had nothing to do with\" the attack at the embassy. He also noted that the US \"would always call for the protection of embassies belonging to any diplomatic mission throughout the world.\"\nThe FBI declined to comment.\nCCD maintains that they shared information with the FBI voluntarily, but at the bureau's request.\n\"No information about Madrid was shared with any parties with the expectation of any benefit or money in exchange. The organization shared certain information of enormous potential value with the FBI in the United States, under mutually agreed terms of confidentiality. This information was shared voluntarily and on their request, not our own. Those terms appear to have been broken,\" the statement said, referring to media reports implicating them in the break in.\nSpanish authorities confirmed earlier this month that they were investigating a reported attack on the embassy but declined to provide details about an ongoing probe.\nSpain's Interior Ministry previously said it does not comment on active investigations.\nPrevious accounts of the attack published by the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds said a group of individuals carrying fake firearms entered the compound where they interrogated and beat up people inside.\nThe alleged assailants then restrained staff members with rope and stole a variety of items before fleeing in luxury vehicles, according to Spanish media reports.\nSimilar details were revealed in the Spanish court document released Tuesday.\nA source familiar with the incident previously told CNN that the Cheollima Civil Defense, a shadowy North Korean dissident group, is believed to be behind the attack, which occurred days before US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held their second summit, in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi.\nTrump and Kim's meeting ended abruptly in part due to disagreement over when to remove UN sanctions in exchange for steps toward Pyongyang's denuclearization. But Trump and his aides said both sides left on good terms.\nThe Washington Post was first to report the involvement of the secretive group. They were also first to report that the FBI was contacted by the alleged intruders.\nThe Cheollima Civil Defense first gained international recognition after it reportedly came to the defense of Kim Han Sol, the son of Kim Jong Nam. Kim Jong Nam, the elder half-brother of North Korea's leader, was exposed to the deadly nerve agent VX in 2017 while entering an airport in Kuala Lumpur, killing him in minutes. US, South Korean and Malaysian authorities have pinned the attack on Pyongyang, but North Korea has adamantly denied any responsibility.\nIt's unclear why Kim Jong Nam was killed, but analysts said that if North Korea was behind the murder, perhaps Kim Jong Un saw his brother and his family as a possible threat to his leadership.\n\"The Cheollima Civil Defense established credibility by acting quickly and getting Kim Han Sol, the son of Kim Jong Nam, within days of his father's gruesome assassination,\" said Sung-Yoon Lee, a professor at Tufts University Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.",

The cause of death was drowning.\nTheir fully clothed bodies were discovered Oct. 24 near the river, two months after they were last seen in Fairfax, Virginia, where they had been living in a shelter amid allegations that they were abused at home.\nPolice said the sisters had been in Manhattan since Sept. 1, staying at expensive hotels and ordering in pairs of meals until a credit card they were using maxed out. A jogger said he saw them praying at a playground near the river, sitting about 30 feet (9 meters) apart with their heads in their hands, hours before their bodies were found, police said.\nThe deaths shined a light on the secretive and risky journeys Saudi women take to flee their homes in the kingdom and abroad.

The 28-year-old was arrested on Tuesday as part of a year-long investigation into the deaths of babies at the Countess of Chester hospital\u2019s neonatal unit in 2015-16.\nLetby was held on suspicion of the murder of eight babies and the attempted murder of six others. She has not been charged. Police said she had been bailed pending further inquiries.\n\u201cWe continue to recognise that this investigation has a huge impact on all of the families, staff and patients at the hospital as well as members of the public. Parents of all the babies continue to be kept fully updated and are being supported throughout the process by specially trained officers,\u201d Cheshire police said.\n\u201cThis is an extremely difficult time for all the families and it is important to remember that at the heart of this there are a number of bereaved families seeking answers as to what happened to their children.\u201d\nThe force said the investigation was ongoing and there were no set timescales for progress.\nA spokesman for the Countess of Chester hospital NHS foundation trust said: \u201cWe are continuing to support Cheshire police with their ongoing investigation.\n\u201cIn line with the trust\u2019s current policies, the member of staff involved will not be returning to work while this matter is ongoing.

The vehicle had been moved to a neighbouring driveway on Tuesday to clear space to erect a blue forensics tent, which remains in place.\nIn the afternoon officers wearing white suits and blue gloves were seen carrying pieces of wood out of the property and digging up the back garden.

    "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/15/gdansk-polish-city-mourning-mayor-pawel-adamowicz-stabbing": "The music has been switched off at the Red Light pub in the heart of the picturesque old town of Gda\u0144sk. A single candle adorned with a black ribbon rests on the bar. The city is in mourning.\nThe people of Gda\u0144sk are coming to terms with the death of their mayor, Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz, who was stabbed on stage at a charity concert in front of thousands of people on Sunday. A public appeal led to crowds of people queueing for hours to donate blood to save their mayor, but he was pronounced dead on Monday afternoon.\nAt the Red Light, people console each other between shots dedicated to Adamowicz. Adela Szczepa\u0144ska-Ko\u015bcielnik was at the concert when the attack happened. It was the local finale of a nationwide charity drive, the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity, which raises funds to buy equipment for children\u2019s units in state-run hospitals. The concerts end with a countdown towards the moment when fundraising stops and people raise lights in the air in celebration. Adamowicz was leading the countdown; the attack was timed to coincide with the moment it reached zero.\n\u201cAt the end of the countdown we didn\u2019t understand what happened. There was no light, no music. A girl started screaming: \u2018They killed him! They killed him!\u2019 We were confused, some people thought it was a joke. The city has never been so sad, it is as if someone cut the electricity.\u201d\n01:02 Thousands across Poland pay tribute to stabbed Gda\u0144sk mayor - video\nAfter the announcement of the mayor\u2019s death on Monday, thousands of people gathered at the statue of Neptune in the city\u2019s Long Market, also home to city hall, where Adamowicz served for more than 20 years. With tears running down people\u2019s faces, the crowd stood motionless as they listened to an a capella version of Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s Sound of Silence.\nThis was silence with a purpose \u2013 not only to mourn, but to protest against an increasing prevalence of hate speech in Polish public discourse that Adamowicz had attempted to confront. A staunch defender of migrants and refugees and of LGBT rights, he had marketed Gda\u0144sk as a liberal enclave, a city in open defiance of the xenophobic nationalism promoted by Poland\u2019s rightwing Law and Justice party (PiS), which has governed since 2015.\n\u201cI am a European so my nature is to be open,\u201d Adamowicz told the Guardian in 2016. \u201cGda\u0144sk is a port and must always be a refuge from the sea.\u201d\nHis liberal stance cast him as a hate figure for government supporters and the far right. In a 2017 publicity stunt, the All-Polish Youth movement published a series of \u201cpolitical death certificates\u201d of pro-European politicians; on Adamowicz\u2019s certificate, they put his \u201ccause of death\u201d as \u201cliberalism, multiculturalism, stupidity\u201d. Observers say he was regularly subjected to personal attacks and abuse on social media and from rightwing media outlets.\nDemonstrators holding a \u2018stop the hate\u2019 banner during a march in memory of Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz on Monday. Photograph: Attila Husejnow/Sopa Images/Rex/Shutterstock\nSome of the attacks continued even after he died. In an interview with a rightwing media outlet broadcast on the day Adamowicz\u2019s death was announced, the far-right politician Grzegorz Braun described him as a \u201ctraitor to the nation\u201d for his political views.\n\u201cSadly, hatred is becoming more and more visible and more widely accepted in Polish political and social life,\u201d read a joint declaration of Jewish organisations in Poland, published on Tuesday. \u201cThe death of Mayor Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz is yet another tragic warning signal that in our society, ideological differences, and differences of worldview, can lead \u2013 in extreme cases \u2013 to acts of physical violence.\u201d\nAdamowicz told the Italian newspaper la Repubblica in 2017: \u201cPhysical abuse is normally preceded by verbal violence. When the language of the elites violates the limits imposed by decency, it causes more and more physical violence. Unfortunately this is not a theory but the reality, as the growing cases of racially and religiously based violence demonstrate.\u201d\nSome people have drawn parallels between Adamowicz\u2019s murder and the assassination of Gabriel Narutowicz, the leftwing president of interwar Poland who was shot by a rightwing activist in the 1920s. Making this connection explicit, a silent \u201cmarch against hatred\u201d held in Warsaw on Monday evening made its way through the streets of the capital to the Zach\u0119ta art gallery, where Narutowicz was killed in 1922.\nA woman signs a book of condolence for Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz in Warsaw on Tuesday. Photograph: Tomasz Gzell/EPA\nMany on the Polish right have accused their liberal opponents of politicising the murder by attributing political motives to the killing. The alleged murderer, a 27-year-old resident of Gda\u0144sk named in press reports as \u201cStefan W\u201d, said he had been released from prison only last month after serving a jail sentence for a series of violent bank robberies. According to Polish media reports, he was diagnosed with and treated for paranoid schizophrenia while in prison, but stopped taking his medication before his release. He pleaded not guilty to murder on Monday.\nMany of Adamowicz\u2019s supporters, noting he has long been a target of aggressive government propaganda, are incensed at what they regard as attempts by those they hold largely responsible for Poland\u2019s toxic political climate to wash their hands of any responsibility.\n\u201cIf you watched our main government TV, you would see that for months there were programmes about how bad he is, how he lies, how he steals,\u201d said Witek Nabo\u017cny, a resident of Gda\u0144sk who had come to the statue of Neptune to pay his respects. \u201cThey created a mood in which weak people, sick people, respond to this kind of atmosphere.\u201d\n\u201cAdamowicz has become a symbol of something bigger than the attack itself. He died during a charity event that tries to bring Poles together. As a result, he became a symbol of the death of unity in this society,\u201d said Rafa\u0142 Pankowski, the director of the Never Again association, an anti-racism campaign group. Adamowicz had begun his career as a much more conservative politician, he said.\n\u201cHe started to become more and more outspoken on issues of diversity and minority rights and tolerance just as society was moving in the opposite direction. It was very impressive. He was a very brave man \u2013 and he paid for it.\u201d",

But Eurovision was unable to live up to its apolitical aspirations this year, with deep domestic and international divisions causing significant contention from day one.\nPoliticians in Israel tried and failed to convince the event\u2019s organisers, the European Broadcasting Union, to allow them to host in Jerusalem as a symbolic move intended to boost their disputed claim to the holy city, part of which is contested by the Palestinians.\nConcerns over the event peaked earlier this month when Israel and militants in Gaza fought one of deadliest clashes in years, killing 23 Palestinians and four Israelis and sparking the rumblings of war. An unofficial truce ended three days of bloodshed and appeared to have held.\nMeanwhile, rights campaigners accuse Israel of exploiting the frivolous pizzazz to distract from its treatment of Palestinians, millions of whom live just an hour\u2019s drive from Tel Aviv under military rule in the West Bank or blockaded in Gaza to the south.\nThe global boycott, divestment and sanctions movement \u2013 which calls for an end to the occupation, to stop discrimination against Arabs in Israel, and to allow Palestinian refugees and their families to return \u2013 has also pressurised singers to pull out.

The quicks were amazing with the new ball. Virat is an unbelievable batter in some serious nick and it was nice to get him out when we did. I definitely do not want to call him my bunny! I was under pressure after he hit me for two boundaries but I tried to keep my cool and he missed it, luckily. I feel like I\u2019m bowling well at the moment, especially in tandem with Nathan. The message from the coaches is to continually look for wickets. You\u2019re gonna go for runs so an attacking mindset goes a long way.\u201d\n8 Mar 2019 15.44 GMT That\u2019s a fine win for Australia, which keeps the series alive. The return to form of Aaron Finch is a happy bonus, and they will be particularly pleased that they won the game despite another immense innings from Virat Kohli. Usman Khawaja also made his first ODI hundred to continue his excellent form, while Pat Cummins, Jhye Richardson and Adam Zampa all bowled very well. Cummins and Richardson both ended with three for 37, while Zampa took three vital wickets: Dhoni, Jadhav and Kohli.\nUpdated at 15.46 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 15.41 GMT AUSTRALIA WIN BY 32 RUNS! WICKET! India 281 all out (Kuldeep c Finch b Cummins 10) That\u2019ll do. Pat Cummins, whose new-ball spell put Australia on top, finishes the job when Kuldeep holes out to the captain Finch.\n8 Mar 2019 15.39 GMT 48th over: India 281-9 (Kuldeep 10, Bumrah 0) \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Dennis Johns. \u201cJust discussing with a friend about Kohli\u2019s 41 ODI centuries and we got to thinking: what year do you reckon England reached 41 ODI tons as a team/nation state/whatever? For what it\u2019s worth, he\u2019s saying 1997 and I\u2019m saying 2003. Neither of us are adept enough at StatsGuru to figure it out. I know this is a sorrowful admission to make on the OBO. Fancy a crack to settle it? (And shared enjoyment of how lamentable England were at one day cricket for basically ever.)\u201d If my Statsguruing is correct, the answer is \u2026 22 February 1996.\nUpdated at 15.39 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 15.38 GMT WICKET! India 281-9 (Shami c Cummins b Richardson 8) Australia are one wicket away. Shami smacks two jaunty boundaries before miscuing a slower bouncer to cover.\n8 Mar 2019 15.34 GMT WICKET! India 273-8 (Jadeja c Maxwell b Richardson 24) A second wicket for the excellent Jhye Richardson. Jadeja drags a slower ball to mid-on, where Maxwell takes an easy catch. Australia are two wickets or 17 balls anyway from a fine victory.\n8 Mar 2019 15.33 GMT 47th over: India 273-7 (Jadeja 24, Kuldeep 10) Jadeja swings Maxwell sweetly over midwicket for six. That\u2019s an impressive, defiant stroke, and he manages to keep the strike with a single off the last ball. Ten from the over.\n8 Mar 2019 15.30 GMT 46th over: India 263-7 (Jadeja 15, Kuldeep 8) Another quiet over from Richardson leaves India needing 51 from 24 balls. This game is done and dunner. \u201cNow that the game is drawing to a mundane close,\u201d says Surendranath Halder, \u201cmay I ask what your opinion about the five balls per innings idea by Abhijato would be?\u201d Hi Abhijato. I think it\u2019s a bad idea: gimmicky, messy and unnecessary. But I\u2019m frequently wrong, so there\u2019s that.\nUpdated at 15.31 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 15.26 GMT 45th over: India 260-7 (Jadeja 13, Kuldeep 7) Lyon finishes with figures of 10-0-57-1. India need 54 from 30 balls; don\u2019t we all.\n8 Mar 2019 15.23 GMT 44th over: India 253-7 (Jadeja 13, Kuldeep 2) This match is all over bar the clouting. The returning Richardson concedes only two from his seventh over, pushing the required rate above 10 an over. He\u2019s been impresisve today and would be in my World Cup squad, for whatever that\u2019s worth. (Clue: nowt.)\nUpdated at 15.24 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 15.19 GMT 43rd over: India 251-7 (Jadeja 12) That was the last ball of the over, so India need 63 from 42 balls. \u201cA few weeks ago a friend of mine posted a pic on social media of himself in a Caribbean bar with Viv,\u201d says Pete Salmon. \u201cI was able to shoot off a question to ask the great man: \u201c\u2018When Viv is trying to sleep does he imagine that he is a 48-year-old, slim white copy-editor from the UK, like I imagine I\u2019m him?\u2019 \u201cViv\u2019s answer was, \u2018No.\u2019 \u201cMy greatest sporting moment.\u201d\n8 Mar 2019 15.18 GMT WICKET! India 251-7 (Shankar c Richardson b Lyon 32) That should be the match for Australia. Shankar, who slog swept Lyon mightily for four earlier in the over, tries to repeat the shot and holes out to Richardson on the boundary.\n8 Mar 2019 15.14 GMT 42nd over: India 242-6 (Shankar 27, Jadeja 9) Shankar hits the first boundary since the dismissal of Kohli, driving Zampa high over extra cover. Lovely shot, that. Zampa completes an expensive but probably matchwinning spell with figures of 10-0-70-3. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Dean Kinsella. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Mr Kohli is admired, revered, idolised or whatever but I tell you what - he\u2019s bloody good at batting! I feel that after he mastered English conditions last time around, we could see something extraordinary from him in this summer\u2019s World Cup. He has the ability, passion and drive to carry his team with him (like today) in the same way that Mr Tendulkar did. There is no-one on his level in world cricket and I think that makes India firm favourites to win this summer.\u201d I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d make India favourites, firm or otherwise, but it wouldn\u2019t be remotely surprising if Kohli completed his exorcism of that 2014 series by scoring 162 not out to beat England in the final. He\u2019s so far ahead of everyone else, especially in ODIs. It\u2019s like he\u2019s found a cheat code for batting.\n8 Mar 2019 15.08 GMT 41st over: India 231-6 (Shankar 19, Jadeja 7) Replays show that Jadeja would have been given out had Australia been able to review. Even after a decade of DRS, greedy bowlers are still frittering away views. The earlier one from Glenn Maxwell was a shocker. It shouldn\u2019t matter, however, because the game is getting away from India. The tempo has changed completely since the departure of Kohli.\nUpdated at 15.09 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 15.05 GMT 40th over: India 227-6 (Shankar 17, Jadeja 5) Jadeja, missing a sweep, survives an LBW appeal from Zampa. I think it pitched outside leg. Jadeja survives an even better LBW appeal later in the over, but Australia cannot review it because of Maxwell\u2019s earlier indulgence. That looked out. India need 87 from 60 balls.\nUpdated at 15.06 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 15.01 GMT 39th over: India 223-6 (Shankar 16, Jadeja 3) \u201cFor my money, Viv was the better all-round player,\u201d says Richard O\u2019Hagan. \u201cA better bowler and fielder, but also (though not by much) a better batsman. Only Sachin and Lara since have had the same dominance over bowling attacks for a sustained period of time.\u201d I suspect he was too, from everything I\u2019ve seen and read. Lara is the most destructive and exciting player I\u2019ve seen (post-1988), but Kohli\u2019s consistency is terrifying.\n8 Mar 2019 14.57 GMT 38th over: India 221-6 (Shankar 15, Jadeja 2) Quite a comeback from Zampa, who is such an intelligent and courageous bowler. Australia are big favourites now. It was another amazing innings from Kohli: 123 from 95 balls with 14 fours and a six. The ICC need to introduce a handicap for this man. He should start every innings on -20.\nUpdated at 15.01 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 14.54 GMT WICKET! India 219-6 (Kohli b Zampa 123) Silencio. Kohli has gone! He hit Zampa for two stunning boundaries off the first two balls but was bowled by the third, missing an extravagant flick at a ball that skidded on to hit leg stump. It was a poor shot, actually, as if he got carried away with the first two boundaries. Zampa celebrates with teammates. Photograph: Aijaz Rahi/AP\nUpdated at 15.14 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 14.52 GMT 37th over: India 211-5 (Kohli 115, Shankar 15) Australia are under the pump, but they know the wicket of Kohli would instantly make them odds-on favourites. Pat Cummins returns to the attack with that in mind. He almost gets Shankar, who inside edges just past the stumps, and concedes six from the over. India need 103 from 78 balls. \u201cAs Kohli has reached his 41st century in ODIs, I would like to share that I was there at the Eden Gardens when he scored his first hundred for India,\u201d says Avitaj Mitra. \u201c24th December, 2009. India needed 320 odd against Sri Lanka. Sachin and Sehwag went cheaply.Gambhir and Kohli got hundreds, India won by 7 wickets. Gambhir won the man of the match award, which he graciously shared with Kohli. Lovely day, all around. I knew then he was good, but nobody could have predicted he would be this good.\u201d No, I doubt even he thought he would be this good.\n8 Mar 2019 14.47 GMT 36th over: India 205-5 (Kohli 111, Shankar 13) Kohli scorches Zampa down the ground, where the diving Shaun Marsh does exceptionally well to save two runs. Kohli takes Marsh out of the equation next ball, cuffing a slog sweep over him at long on for six. It wasn\u2019t perfectly struck but there was enough on it to clear the ropes. Shankar survives a precautionary stumping referral \u2013 Carey didn\u2019t even appeal \u2013 and then edges very fine for four. Fourteen runs from the over.\n8 Mar 2019 14.44 GMT 35th over: India 191-5 (Kohli 104, Shankar 9) Maxwell\u2019s fourth over is extremely eventful. Kohli is dropped on 98, a sharp deflection to the keeper Carey. Shankar survives an abysmal LBW review after missing a sweep; the ball pitched well outside leg stump and Australia have lost their review. And then, after being reprieved, Kohli reaches another awesome hundred. I don\u2019t use that word lightly, dude. It\u2019s his 41st in ODIs and has come from only 85 balls. I\u2019m trying not to get carried away, and I didn\u2019t see Sir Viv in his pomp, but Kohli might be the best batsman I\u2019ve ever seen. Kohli raises his bat to celebrate scoring a century.

But if you want to try this year\u2019s, click here and use this code: FCABNGCJ.\nUpdated at 14.40 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 14.35 GMT 34th over: India 186-5 (Kohli 98, Shankar 8) Another thrifty over from the impressive Zampa, including one delivery that bounces sharply and forces Kohli to abort his attacking stroke. That\u2019s drinks.\nUpdated at 14.36 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 14.32 GMT 33rd over: India 182-5 (Kohli 96, Shankar 6) Shankar gets his first boundary with a classy stroke, steering Maxwell through backward point. He\u2019s beaten all ends up by the next delivery, which slips through the gate and misses the off stump. Carey couldn\u2019t take the ball cleanly, thoguh I don\u2019t think it was a stumping chance. Seven from the over.\nUpdated at 14.34 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 14.26 GMT WICKET! India 174-5 (Jadhav LBW b Zampa 26) Australia get a much-needed wicket, if not the wicket they really needed, when Jadhav misses a sweep at Zampa and is plumb LBW.\n8 Mar 2019 14.23 GMT 31st over: India 169-4 (Kohli 90, Jadhav 26) With Australia in urgent need of a wicket, Richardson returns to the attack. Instead he goes for consecutive boundaries, with Kohli flicking an inswinger to fine leg and creaming another through the covers on the run. That was a shot of exhilarating contempt.\n8 Mar 2019 14.20 GMT 30th over: India 160-4 (Kohli 81, Jadhav 26) Not for the first time today, Lyon is too straight and Kohli works him very fine for four. Replays suggest this one may have only hit the pad but runs were given. Kohli survives a run-out chance later in the over when Jadhav takes a tight single to Maxwell at midwicket. He would have been out with a direct hit, and Maxwell screams with frustration as the ball whistles past the stumps.\n8 Mar 2019 14.16 GMT 29th over: India 153-4 (Kohli 75, Jadhav 25) \u201cAs an Indian, let me jump in,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. \u201c1) Virat Kohli was genuinely hated by most fellow nationals above the age of forty when he was a young kid showing the finger to the Aussie crowds. Around that time he played the blockbuster innings against Sri Lanka in the tri-series where he smoked Malinga to make people take notice. After assuming the Test captaincy, he\u2019s grown to be seen as a legend in the making. Since 2016, he started making double tons and becoming more mature on the field as well as with the press. He\u2019s been hailed as an idol freely despite his new-age approach with infinite tattoos and expletives. He\u2019s calmed down, and proportionally India has loved him evermore. \u201c2) Dhoni was an unknown face until his 180-odd against Sri Lanka in a chase while opening. He went on to win the World Cup and is the stoic legend everyone adores, except for that period where he dropped senior players in a VB series. He won back the love emphatically when they defeated Australia in the finals. \u201c3) Sachin is Sachin.\u201d But is Sachin as Sachin does?\nUpdated at 14.16 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 14.13 GMT 28th over: India 151-4 (Kohli 74, Jadhav 24) Lyon returns to the attack and hurries through a good over \u2013 three from it. India need 163 from 132 balls.\n8 Mar 2019 14.10 GMT 27th over: India 148-4 (Kohli 73, Jadhav 22) Glenn Maxwell replaces Adam Zampa and almost grabs Kohli with his second ball! It turned through the gate from around the wicket and beat Carey en route for four leg byes. Maxwell went up for the LBW and also wanted a review, but Finch decided it was too high. Replays suggest there was an inside-edge anyway. It\u2019s another expensive over, with Jadhav scorching a flat, one-bounce four down the ground. India scored 74 from the first 18 overs; they\u2019ve added 74 more in the last nine. \u201cThis is with regards to Geoff Wignall\u2019s observation,\u201d says Avitaj Mitra. \u201cI think he\u2019s spot on. Tendulkar is loved and revered mostly because he was the only one who would single-handedly drag India to improbable victories especially during the early and mid-1990s (before the emergence of Dravid and Ganguly). Dhoni of course is more loved because he brought back the World Cup trophy, plus his ability to always remain a fair person, even under severe pressure (recalling Ian Bell in 2011 springs to mind). Kohli, despite his frankly staggering skills, especially in run-chases, still rubs people up the wrong way, mostly because of his brash attitude, win-at-all-costs mentality and \u2018colourful language\u2019 when things don\u2019t always go his way.\u201d\nUpdated at 14.10 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 14.06 GMT 26th over: India 137-4 (Kohli 72, Jadhav 16) Kohli blasts Stoinis inside-out over extra cover for four, another devastatingly good shot. And he ends the over with consecutive boundaries, a flick off the pads followed by a delightful push-drive through extra cover. This is simply awesome batting from Kohli, who has 72 from 60 balls. \u201cInspiration is a funny thing,\u201d says James Walsh. \u201cFollowing your OBO coverage today while smoothing out a short sci fi play I wrote for luck. One of the characters is a messianic tech genius CEO, who is in denial about how his latest product has merged all possible realities together into a kind of Fukuyama end-of-history soup.

With Bednarek just sort of standing a couple of yards outside it waiting for Szczesny to claim the ball after haring out of his area, Niang darted between both Poles, flicked the ball goalwards and had the relatively straight forward task of advancing a few yards and scoring into an empty net while Szczesny and Bednarek stood glaring at each other and Krychowiak.\nUpdated at 18.12 BST\n19 Jun 2018 17.33 BST 72 min: Gueye is booked for a foul on Robert Lewandowski.

It seems the ref had waved him back on and after that it was just tough luck on Poland, who only have themselves to blame for that defensive calamity.\n19 Jun 2018 17.25 BST 62 min: Awful stuff from Poland. From the centre of the pitch and for reasons best known to himself, Krychowiak tries to loft a 50 yard pass back to his own goalkeeper. His pass drops woefully short and with Niang and Szczesny both charging at the ball from opposite directions, the Senegal wins it and has the straightforward task of shooting into an empty net. Bednarek could have done better too, but looked powerless to stop Niang as he raced Szczesny to the ball.\n19 Jun 2018 17.21 BST GOAL!

Sadio Mane has been fairly quiet, as has Poland\u2019s most creative player, Piotr Zielinski. Robert Lewandowski had little or no service in that first half. Play resumes, with Bednarek on for Poland. He\u2019s immediately clattered in an accidental collision.\n19 Jun 2018 16.52 BST Half-time: Poland 0-1 Senegal Peeep! The players troop off for their half-time cuppa, with Senegal leading by the only goal of the game. It\u2019s been entertaining enough, but far from a classic. Thiago Cionek\u2019s own-goal separates the sides; the Polish central defender was helpless to do much about it after Idrissa Gueye\u2019s low drive went in off his shin after 37 minutes.\n19 Jun 2018 16.50 BST 45 min: We\u2019re into added time at the end of the first half. There\u2019s a touch of England-against-Tunisia about Poland\u2019s performance - they\u2019re looking toothless up front and lacking that little bit of creative flair in midfield that might cause Senegal problems.\n19 Jun 2018 16.47 BST 44 min: The clock ticks towards half-time with Senegal continuing to dominate. Krychowiak is penalised for a foul ion Idrissa Gueye about 10 yards inside the Poland half. He\u2019s already on a yellow card and can count himself extremely lucky not to have got a second one for that late tackle.\n19 Jun 2018 16.45 BST 41 min: Senegal corner. The ball\u2019s floated into the mixer and burley Senegal centre-back defender Salif Sane leaps highest. He doesn\u2019t make decent contact with the ball and admonishes himself in the strongest possible terms after heading the ball straight into the ground. He should have scored there.\n19 Jun 2018 16.44 BST 40 min: Fifa\u2019s boffins have decreed that Gueye\u2019s shot was going narrowly wide before it was deflected, so Senegal\u2019s opener will officially go down as a Thiago Cionek own-goal.\n19 Jun 2018 16.42 BST 38 min: Dearie me, how\u2019s your luck? Senegal take the lead through a deflected goal. Mane squared the ball for Idrissa Gueye several yards outside the penalty area and the Everton man took a shot.

Both sides look fairly evenly matched, but good chances have been conspicuous by their absence.

    "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/08/lily-allen-no-shame-review": "It\u2019s hard not to heave a weary sigh as Lily Allen\u2019s fourth album gets under way. From the title down, No Shame has been trumpeted as a ballsy return to form following 2014\u2019s Sheezus \u2013 and yet the opening track, Come on Then, sounds remarkably like something off that album. A relative of Wind Your Neck In or URL Badman without the latter\u2019s acerbic wit, it\u2019s a prickly, defensive whinge about \u201cthe socials\u201d, their cyclical relationship with the tattle mags and tabloids and Allen\u2019s depiction therein.\nOf course, Allen has plenty to feel prickly about \u2013 growing up in public, she\u2019s been given the kind of hard time that Twitter\u2019s grimmer corners and sidebar-of-shame authors seem to reserve exclusively for young women who make their voices heard. Nevertheless, as she demands to know why what\u2019s written about her is \u201cso far from the truth\u201d, it\u2019s hard to assuage the feeling that you\u2019ve heard this all before, and not just from her. Modern pop is already waist-deep in songs bemoaning haters, deceitful journalists and the disparity between public perception and reality. It\u2019s the equivalent of 70s rock stars complaining that life on the road was lonely and tedious: a complaint about a downside of stardom that\u2019s been repeated to the point of cliche.\nA groan of \u201chere we go again\u201d is no way to start any album, especially one heralded as a big comeback. Yet the rest of No Shame is not like its opening track at all. At its centre are a suite of songs depicting in unsparing detail the collapse of Allen\u2019s marriage, and the emotional tone shifts continually: from self-loathing to blame-laying, from denial to melancholy, nostalgia and regret. It never otherwise deals in prickly defensiveness; Family Man and What You Waiting For are not songs from which the author emerges covered in glory.\nIt all feels very realistic. You listen to Allen accusing and admitting, contradicting and doubling back on herself, filled with second thoughts, and think: yeah, that\u2019s probably exactly what divorce is like. It would be a hard listen were it not for the fact that the music is so great: tropical house shot in soft-focus and slow-motion, orchestrated 70s singer-songwriter ballads, every melody and chorus finished to a uniformly high standard. It\u2019s the negative image of Coldplay\u2019s similarly themed Ghost Stories, an album that moped around in its dressing gown, too listless and depressed to come up with a memorable tune.\nElsewhere, her confidence shows up in other ways. Scattering your album with guest spots from UK rappers \u2013 Giggs, Meridian Dan, Lady Chann \u2013 could look like a desperate lunge for contemporaneity, but it never does. Allen\u2019s early work bore the sonic hallmarks of an artist who\u2019d spent their life with \u201cone foot in the rave\u201d, as she puts it on Trigger Bang, immersed in London\u2019s urban music past and present: it takes an innate understanding of reggae, ska, calypso and hip-hop to blend them so successfully into the pop confection of 2006\u2019s Alright, Still. Similarly, on No Shame, she seems to know exactly what to do with her guest stars: their appearances feel integral, never grafted on; the moment Lady Chann and Allen start singing together on Waste is pure joy.\nOn Three, meanwhile, she\u2019s confident enough to even try a gushy paean to her kids, something all rock and pop artists should be contractually obliged not to do \u2013 if Stevie Wonder at the zenith of his powers couldn\u2019t get the baby snaps out without making you want to die of embarrassment, you\u2019ve got no chance. So it proves. Writing a song from the point of view of a toddler proves impossible to do without sounding cutesy; the piano ballad accompaniment is the least interesting on the album. Pushing Up Daisies meanwhile, hymns a new relationship with til-death-us-do-part fealty. The lyrical update of When I\u2019m 64 is very witty \u2013 will you still need me, it ponders, \u201cwhen we\u2019re just a strain on the NHS \u2026 when I\u2019m a Daily Mail-reading know-what\u2019s-best\u201d \u2013 but feels weird after seven tracks that depict a marriage falling apart in unforgiving depth. It\u2019s as if Ingmar Bergman\u2019s punishing Scenes from a Marriage had ended with the cast putting paper hats on and doing the conga.\nSo, No Shame is a slightly odd album, where the horror of divorce is laid bare next to cheery pledges of everlasting love, where stuff wrapped in cliche coexists with songs that are painfully honest and revealing. Still, as Allen would doubtless point out, she never claimed to be perfect. What she is, No Shame strongly suggests, is ready and able to tough it out.",

He published a memoir, A Comedian\u2019s Tale, in which he described his onstage character as his \u201cMr Hyde\u201d. He also released an album of standup and songs entitled Sex and Death.\nFellow comedians commented on Cognito\u2019s generosity.

This result in Rome against the player who last week won the Madrid Open title will give the British player even more confidence entering the French Open, which starts next weekend.\nIn Sunday\u2019s final, Konta will face fourth-seeded Karolina Pliskova after her 6-4, 6-4 win over Sakkari in the second semi-final.\nMidway through the first set, Konta surprised Bertens with a drop-shot winner during a baseline rally, causing Bertens to fall on her stomach to the clay as she rapidly changed directions. In the next game, Konta ran down a drop shot and produced an angled winner that drew a roar from the crowd.\nThe 42nd-ranked Konta served for the first set at 5-4 but was broken to love. However Bertens later double faulted to let Konta serve for the second set and Konta got an early break in the third.\n\u201cI knew going into the match against Kiki that she\u2019s playing some of the best tennis right now in her career. She came off of winning Madrid. She\u2019s definitely in amazing form. She\u2019s No 4 in the world.

I thought I did that well. I stayed very open in trying to find a solution in each point, in each ball. I just trusted that. I kind of accepted both ways. I mean, after I lost the first set, I didn\u2019t do much wrong. It was a very good set of tennis. Equally the second set. There wasn\u2019t anybody putting a bad foot out of line.\n\u201cIn the third, I definitely felt that I was able to maintain my level a bit better than her. I think that gave me the upper hand in stringing some more points together. I\u2019m just very happy to have come through.\u201d\nIn the men\u2019s event, Rafael Nadal looked more like his old, dominant self when he beat Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3, 6-4 to reach the final. It was a measure of revenge for Nadal after losing to Tsitsipas in three sets at this stage in Madrid last week, the last of three consecutive defeats for the Spaniard in the semi-finals clay-court tournaments.\nThis victory should also restore Nadal\u2019s confidence as he prepares to seek a record\u2011extending 12th title at the French Open.\nNadal, aiming for a ninth title at the Foro Italico, will now face Novak Djokovic who beat Diego Schwartzman 6-3, 6-7 (2), 6-3.",
    "https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/01/hands_on_ace_combat_7_skies_unknown_in_psvr_passes_with_flying_colours": "Subscribe to Push Square on\nFor some, a huge part of the appeal for Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown is its additional PlayStation VR mode. Much has been made of the VR content in Bandai Namco's aerial arcade action title, as the idea of dogfighting among the clouds sat in the virtual cockpit is a perfect fit. Luckily, Project Aces hasn't hastily slapped something together to placate PSVR owners -- the mode offers an impressive new perspective on the series' breakneck in-air gameplay.\nAn enforced first person view keeps you firmly in the boots of the ace pilot, Mobius 1, in a short series of missions that take place several years before the events of the regular campaign. There are three missions to play in PSVR, all of which are a little less complex than some of the main game's tougher sorties. However, you'll appreciate the slightly lower difficulty, as piloting a fighter jet in virtual reality is a very intense experience, regardless of enemy threats.\nControlling your aircraft is identical to how it all works in the base game, meaning those familiar with Ace Combat's flying should feel right at home. The effect VR has on the experience, though, is potentially overwhelming. When you're trying to pin down an enemy fighter, pitching and rolling all over the place, there's a possibility it'll cause some lightheadedness, as though you're actually feeling the effects of high g-force. Not everyone will be affected in this way, of course, but it's worth bearing in mind if you're prone to motion sickness.\nThe good news is that some of the UI moves with you, providing you a point for your eyes to focus on. The radar normally affixed in the bottom left corner, however, now resides physically in the cockpit, meaning you'll need to glance down to get your bearings. The same goes for information regarding ammo and damage to your plane; it's made part of your aircraft, enhancing the feeling that you're really flying a supersonic jet. It's all been handled very smartly, and in some ways, you'll feel like a better pilot in VR because you can look all around you and out of the canopy to better locate your targets.\nOnce you've completed the trio of missions, you'll unlock a couple of other modes of play in PSVR. Free Flight is a feature also found in the regular game in which you can fly in any of the three maps with no restrictions or enemies to worry about. The final mode is called Air Show, which places you aboard an aircraft carrier watching planes pulling off air stunts. You can pick and choose what you want to see as well as your position. It's a nice addition that's a welcome change of pace after the high octane missions.\nThe only real downside to Ace Combat 7's VR component is that there isn't more of it. There's nothing stopping you playing through those three missions again, of course, but you'll probably be left feeling a little disappointed there weren't a few extra sorties to tackle. What is here is of a very high quality, make no mistake, and it certainly fulfills that fantasy of being an ace pilot. We hope this isn't the last we see of Ace Combat in PSVR, though, as this short but sweet experience proves it's a match made in heaven.",

    "https://bgr.com/tech/samsung-galaxy-note-10-images-renders-quad-camera/": "There\u2019s still plenty we don\u2019t know yet about the Galaxy Note 10, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the internet from rampant speculation. It doesn\u2019t really matter that the Galaxy S10 isn\u2019t out yet \u2014 we\u2019re already anticipating the next big thing from Samsung. And now, thanks to new 3D renders from PhoneArena, we can get a glimpse of the theoretical future long before the phone maker actually unveils its next-generation flagship phablet.\nUsing the limited number of rumors that have been circulating around the internet in recent weeks, PhoneArena was able to construct its best guess of what the Note 10 will look like. The most enticing rumor regarding the new phone is that it could feature a quad-camera setup, just like the Galaxy S10 5G.\nAlthough the Galaxy S10, S10+ and S10e are all coming out this week, the 5G model won\u2019t be available until later in the summer. In fact, it might launch within a few weeks of the unveiling of the Note 10, so there\u2019s a chance that its camera hardware will be similar. If so, we can expect a 12-megapixel standard lens, a 12-megapixel telephoto lens, a 16-megapixel wide-angle lens, and a 3D depth camera. But Samsung might mix it up a bit.\nThe Galaxy Note 10 will also likely retain the other major upgrades of the S10 series, including the Infinity-O display with the hole-punch selfie camera and in-display fingerprint sensor. In fact, it will be interesting to see how Samsung differentiates the Note 10 from the Galaxy S10 5G, as it features an already-massive 6.7-inch display. How much bigger can the Note 10 get before it becomes unwieldy? Or will it be the same size?\nUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have the answers to these questions yet, as Note 10 leaks have been few and far between. But we expect to see and hear plenty more as the year marches on and August approaches.",
    "https://bgr.com/entertainment/avengers-endgame-spoilers-new-leaks-support-time-travel-theories/": "The Avengers 4 premiere is almost here,and the closer we get to Endgame, the more leaks we see. Disney and Marvel won\u2019t reveal anything about the upcoming blockbuster, as expected, but some of their partners who sell Endgame-based merchandise are dropping spoiler after spoiler. And we now have more confirmation that time travel will be used in the plan that will ultimately undo the deaths from Infinity War.\nLike I said before, there\u2019s no question that Endgame will show us the one future out of the more than 14 million possibilities that Doctor Strange saw in which the Avengers beat Thanos. No matter how dramatic the events are at the end of Endgame, and no matter what personal sacrifices they must make, the Avengers will win and bring almost all the people who died from the snap back to life.\nOver the past few months, we\u2019ve looked at several leaks that suggested the Avengers will go to the Quantum Realm wearing the same kind of suit that Hank Pym had on in Ant-Man and the Wasp. Initially, we saw concept art for Avengers 4 that some people said might be fake. But in the past few months, we saw more and more leaks that proved those costumes were real. The Avengers will have matching suits that are predominantly white, featuring the Avengers logo, and we saw plenty of action figures and Lego toy sets that supported that idea. These toys went on sale much earlier than expected in some markets, and it\u2019s very likely they\u2019re all based on the movie. Here\u2019s a reminder of what some of them look like:\nWith that in mind, you have to check Merchoid\u2019s new additions to the \u201cMarvel officially licensed merchandise\u201d category. We\u2019re looking at caps and hoodies that show the same color palette as the new armor. The new suits are called \u201cAdvanced Tech,\u201d and it\u2019s the kind of tech you\u2019d expect Tony Stark to be working on.\nFan theories explained recently that Doctor Strange kept Tony Stark alive because he needed his brain to come up with the tech that will help them beat Thanos. Making suits for the Quantum Realm is the kind of power only Tony wields. Of course there\u2019s nothing to confirm that the suits are indeed meant for Quantum Realm travel. But it makes perfect sense to assume that\u2019s their purpose. Marvel didn\u2019t show Pym\u2019s Quantum Realm attire by mistake in Ant-Man 2. All the little details matter in these moves.\nAlso, there\u2019s one more thing to note about the image above, and it\u2019s the background image that instantly reminds us of the Quantum Realm.\nMoving on, we have one more important Endgame leak, as seen in the following images from Instagram. We\u2019re looking at a Lego Iron Man minifig that also sports the same white suit:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Bt6H1FwHPXJ/\nMore importantly, we get to see that the package includes Iron Man and fan-favorite character Dum-E. Here\u2019s another look at them:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Bt68vmInsEc/\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the series, then you surely remember Dum-E, the friendly-but-not-too-smart robot that helped Tony around the lab in previous Iron Man and Avengers movies. Here\u2019s a scene where Dum-E saved his life:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQmdrW_e5bE\nBut what\u2019s interesting here is that Lego paired these particular characters together in the same package. That means the Iron Man version that wears white armor might interact with Dum-E in the film. One explanation for this is that Iron Man from the future might encounter Dum-E from the past at some point in Endgame. We also know from other Lego leaks that several old Iron Man suits will also make appearances in Endgame that are significant enough for Lego to make new minifigs based on them, as well as a set based on Tony\u2019s lab. These toys also suggest there\u2019s time travel in Endgame.\nThe simpler explanation is that Tony might make use of Dum-E once he\u2019s back on Earth, although he should have access to more modern tech than Dum-E right now. Also, would that warrant a special new toy?\nWith two months to go until the Endgame premiere, we\u2019ll surely see even more leaks from Avengers 4 merchandise makers.",

A meticulous researcher, he specialized in stories of personal conflict set against the backdrop of compelling historical events, including \u201cThe Caine Mutiny\u201d (1951), \u201cThe Winds of War\u201d (1971) and \u201cWar and Remembrance\u201d (1978). The latter two became ABC miniseries in the 1980s starring Robert Mitchum that averaged tens of millions of viewers over the course of their broadcast and were the highest-rated miniseries after Alex Haley\u2019s \u201cRoots.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nIn a form that the author would echo in other novels, \u201cThe Winds of War\u201d and its sequel, \u201cWar and Remembrance,\u201d trace World War II through the experiences of one family. \u201cThe Winds of War\u201d follows Navy officer Victor \u201cPug\u201d Henry and his relatives from the German invasion of Poland to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, where its sequel begins and then proceeds to the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan.\nThe pair of books established Mr. Wouk\u2019s legacy as a master of historical fiction, in which he blended the narrative power of fiction with great understanding and empathy for the human motivations behind wars and other historical events. The Economist magazine said \u201cThe Winds of War\u201d was \u201cas serious a contribution to the literature of our time as \u2018War and Peace\u2019 was to that of the nineteenth century.\u201d\nLibrarian of Congress James H. Billington said Mr. Wouk helped enliven history in ways that many academic tomes never could and prompted readers to examine the past through engaging fictional characters. \u201cI think he\u2019s been a seminal figure because he\u2019s recrafted the historical novel for a modern audience and not for some niche market,\u201d Billington, who died last year, told The Washington Post in an interview for this obituary.\nAdvertisement\nMr. Wouk, who said he was never a \u201chigh stylist,\u201d attracted a mass audience with books that espoused such values as gallantry and leadership under pressure. Leading critics sniffed at his books, which they often said broke no ground in writing style or character development.\nThe literary essayist Leslie Fiedler once explained Mr. Wouk\u2019s critical reputation by comparing him with Nobel laureate Saul Bellow. \u201cBellow, like most writers critics take seriously, attacked the basic values of middle-class Americans: easy piety, marriage, life in the suburbs,\u201d Fiedler said. \u201cWouk challenges nothing.\u201d\nMr. Wouk said he found nonconformity for its own sake an all-too predictable theme in modern literature and had no interest in experimental or temporarily trendy prose styles. \u201cI write a traditional novel, which is rather unfashionable, and I\u2019ve taken a lot of kicking for it,\u201d he once told The Post. \u201cBut the strength of my work comes from this intense grounding in the 18th- and 19th-century novelists.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHis very significance, wrote Time magazine in a 1955 cover story, was that \u201che spearheads a mutiny against the literary stereotypes of rebellion \u2014 against three decades of U.S. fiction dominated by skeptical criticism, sexual emancipation, social protest and psychoanalytic sermonizing.\u201d\nMr. Wouk began his professional career as a gag writer in the 1930s before moving to the staff of the popular radio comedian Fred Allen. He got that job in part for his notoriety at Columbia University, where his Class of 1934 yearbook named him the wittiest student. He later joked, \u201cIt was not a very sparkling class.\u201d\nEnlisting in the Navy during World War II proved a transformative experience in his development as a writer.\n\u201cMy life was broken at the time, as it was for all of our generation, by the coming of the war, and the winds of war swept a Bronx boy halfway around the world, below the equator, and he landed on an old destroyer minesweeper called the USS Zane,\u201d Mr. Wouk told a National Press Club audience. \u201cAnd that, I think, is where my adult education really began, because there, the hard shell of a New York wise guy cracked and fell off. The shallow conceit of a successful gag man faded away. . . . When I came back, there no longer was a question of a gag writing. I wanted to write novels.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe Caine Mutiny: A Novel of World War II\u201d in 1951 brought Mr. Wouk his first critical and popular success, including the Pulitzer. The book centers on a power struggle aboard the destroyer-minesweeper Caine, culminating in a young lieutenant seizing control of the vessel from the paranoid Capt. Queeg after the crew thinks it faces imminent danger.\nThe action culminates in a court-martial for the lieutenant. Although the novel raised questions of authority and duty versus personal freedom, the naval community embraced it. Queeg also became one of the most memorable characters of the day, a man who relieved his stress by obsessively rolling steel bearings in the palm of his hand.\nTime magazine called \u201cThe Caine Mutiny,\u201d which sold more than 5 million copies worldwide and was translated into 17 languages, the \u201cbiggest U.S. bestseller since \u2018Gone With the Wind.\u2019 \u201d A 1954 film adaptation of the novel, starring Humphrey Bogart as Queeg, became a popular hit, earning Bogart an Academy Award nomination.\nAdvertisement\nThe stage version of the courtroom scenes from \u201cThe Caine Mutiny,\u201d called \u201cThe Caine Mutiny Court-Martial,\u201d proved a Broadway success in the 1950s with Henry Fonda and Lloyd Nolan and remained a staple of community theaters, with productions as far away as China.\nMr. Wouk became further embedded in the cultural firmament with film adaptations of his other books, including \u201cMarjorie Morningstar,\u201d with Gene Kelly and Natalie Wood.\n\u201cMarjorie Morningstar,\u201d published in 1955, underscored another major aspect of Mr. Wouk\u2019s life: books whose themes were central to his Orthodox Jewish faith. \u201cMarjorie Morningstar,\u201d about a young Jewish woman who dreams of being an actress and eventually settles into a life as a suburban housewife, explores how Jews struggled to reconcile their faith with American society. It earned the public\u2019s affection, if not the critics\u2019, and it was credited with helping broaden interest in Jewish American novels later that decade by Philip Roth and others.\nAdvertisement\nHerman Wouk was born May 27, 1915, in the Bronx, which he once called \u201cthat romantic, and much overcriticized borough\u201d of New York. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Russia, and his father worked his way into the presidency of a laundry-chain business.\nAs a child, he told Time, he was the neighborhood fat boy forever being \u201cclobbered\u201d by street toughs. He found comfort in books that his mother bought from a traveling salesman when he was 12. In particular, he grew to love the writing of Mark Twain for his ability to make people laugh, even at matters of faith.\nThe arrival from Russia of his maternal grandfather, an Orthodox Jewish rabbi, would have a decisive influence on Mr. Wouk\u2019s beliefs and many of his later works of fiction and nonfiction.\nMr. Wouk decided at a young age that he wanted to be a writer. He wrote for the college humor magazine and several student musical comedy revues, one of which prompted a student critic to quip, \u201cAll Wouk and no play.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHe graduated in 1934 with majors in philosophy and comparative literature and took a $15-a-week job working for a man he called the \u201cczar of gag writers,\u201d who modernized and cleaned up old jokes and sold them to entertainers such as Eddie Cantor. Within a few years, he joined Fred Allen\u2019s comedy-writing team.\nMr. Wouk returned to comedy later in his career, collaborating with singer Jimmy Buffett on a musical based on Mr. Wouk\u2019s 1965 novel \u201cDon\u2019t Stop the Carnival,\u201d about a harried New York publicist who flees to the fictitious Caribbean island of Amerigo to run a resort hotel. The show became a crowd favorite when it opened in 1997 in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove Playhouse.\nAs war broke out in Europe, Mr. Wouk in 1941 worked on radio shows promoting purchases of war bonds before enlisting in the Navy. The experience, eventually as executive officer of the destroyer-minesweeper Southard, helped inspire \u201cThe Caine Mutiny.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMr. Wouk\u2019s first novel, \u201cAurora Dawn,\u201d was published in 1947. It started as a play he was writing while at sea during the war but evolved into a full-blown story about the life and romances of a radio advertising worker. Though the reviews were mixed, it was selected by the Book of the Month Club.\nHis next novel, \u201cCity Boy\u201d (1948), was about a Jewish youth from the Bronx whom Mr. Wouk based in part on himself. Then, in 1949 came the screenplay for the film \u201cSlattery\u2019s Hurricane,\u201d starring Richard Widmark as a man seeking to redeem himself by flying a reconnaissance mission in a hurricane. The book of the same title was published in 1956.\n\u201cThe Caine Mutiny\u201d proved the sensation that fully established Mr. Wouk's career. His later novels included \u201cYoungblood Hawke\u201d (1962), about an American writer who becomes a victim of his own success, and \u201cThe Hope\u201d (1993) and \u201cThe Glory\u201d (1994), which documented the struggle for Israeli statehood from the perspective of several fictional families. In 2012, Mr. Wouk published his last novel, \u201cThe Lawgiver,\u201d which revolves around the making of a screenplay about Moses and includes Mr. Wouk himself as a character. In 2016, he published a memoir, \u201cSailor and Fiddler: Reflections of a 100-Year-Old Author,\u201d and up until a month ago, he was working on another book.\nThe Library of Congress held events in honor of Mr. Wouk on multiple occasions, including naming him, in 2008, the recipient of its first lifetime achievement award for fiction writing. But he acknowledged that he wasn\u2019t much for being in the public spotlight or at large soirees, instead preferring to throw small dinners with his wife of more than 60 years, the former Betty Brown, who went by her Hebrew name, Sarah. Mrs. Wouk died in 2011, at 90.\nTheir son Abraham drowned as a child in 1951. Survivors include two children, Iolanthe Woulff and Joseph Wouk; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.\nMr. Wouk once joked in a speech that historical fiction is \u201cat best a bastard form and highly suspect.\u201d While his dedication to the genre earned him the respect of such scholars as historian David McCullough and Churchill biographer Martin Gilbert, Mr. Wouk said he recognized that his most important job was as a storyteller.\n\u201cA historical novel, to have any chance of lasting, must meet the highest standards of academic history,\u201d he told an audience in Melbourne, Australia, \u201cand then the novelist has to discard 90 percent of the history in order to tell the story.\u201d\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

So it finally kind of made a demented sense in the 95th minute when the whole thing drifted into psychedelia, as Germany\u2019s relieved players went streaming down the sideline to heave into a festive pile in the stadium corner, having just beheld Toni Kroos\u2019s whiplash winner. They did so as German fans boomed a sound German fans never boom, that unmistakable sound of escape.\nWhat in the World Cup was this 2-1 win by Germany over Sweden?\nIt was a second group game that came off feeling like some gasping semifinal or some death scrap in a prairie. It was an event that gave its 44,287 witnesses an experience nobody ever has, that of seeing Germany \u2014 Germany, that staple of reliability! \u2014 running around all night on a precipice, when the whole idea of Germany is often about the avoidance of precipice. It was a night spent with a defending World Cup champion that hasn\u2019t fallen short of a semifinal this century looking like it might be eliminated after two first-round losses \u2014 as it would have if Sweden\u2019s 1-0 halftime lead had held \u2014 or if it might drift near the early-exit door, as it would have with a draw on Saturday.\nNow Germany has three points in Group F alongside Sweden behind front-running Mexico on six, even as the people who saw it play Sweden will carry home memories soccer fans so seldom have. They saw a German defense \u2014 the German defense, that bulwark of life on Earth! \u2014 look downright harum-scarum against the Swedish counterattack. They saw Germany\u2019s Jerome Boateng look so hopeless that in the 12th minute he had to shove Sweden\u2019s Marcus Berg on a breakaway, and should have gotten carded there with Sweden taking a penalty kick, yet didn\u2019t, yet somehow managed two other cards anyway to depart the premises in the 82nd minute.\nAdvertisement\nThen they saw Germany operate with 10 men from there, yet still hang out around the Swedish goal as if it had 12, so that Germany\u2019s 77-percent possession sometimes felt like 101. A fine mass of passes around the box in the 88th minute established Mario Gomez\u2019s header that goalkeeper Robin Olsen saved, and another threat in the 92nd wound up with Julian Brandt driving from 20 yards and smacking the right post of the goal.\nClearly, the Germans could not finish, and then, at the very last chance, they could.\nWant smart analysis, opinions, viewing guides and more from the World Cup? Sign up for our month-long newsletter. Every match day through the final July 15.\nSomehow in this kooky thing, Sweden\u2019s sub Jimmy Durmaz managed to trip Germany\u2019s Timo Werner left of the box, so that as the curtain fixed to drop on the night, Kroos had a free kick from that spot. He nudged the ball to Marco Reus, who simply stopped it with his foot, teeing up a shot that Kroos sent screaming on a fine curl around the masses and into the upper right side of the net, so that 55-year-old Sweden Manager Janne Andersson called it \u201cprobably the worst end of a game I\u2019ve experienced in my career.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nNobody will forget it, unless Germany just goes blah from here, in which case it will become a dandy little meaningless moment.\nIn fact, the night was so relentless with meaning and surprise that Andersson also expressed anger about the German celebration streaming past the Swedish bench and, he said, \u201crubbing it into our faces.\u201d\nGermany Manager Joachim Loew said, \u201cWe fell into each other\u2019s arms and were so elated.\u201d\nThe Real Madrid employee Kroos said: \u201cHappy, of course. Happy. Was a tough game again today for us. We suffered, but it\u2019s normal if you not score the early goal, and we had the chance, and it\u2019s going to be difficult in the end. It was, but now of course we\u2019re happy.\u201d\nThanks to its loss to Mexico last Sunday and to the Mexicans\u2019 2-1 win over South Korea earlier Saturday, Germany had gone to halftime on the verge of early dismissal, which hadn\u2019t happened to it at this stage since 1938. It had gone to this verge on a sonnet of a goal from Sweden\u2019s Ola Toivonen, who chested Viktor Claesson\u2019s pretty, descending cross in the 32nd minute and plucked the ball over goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. As part of the evening\u2019s gaudy decor, the yellow-clad Swedish quadrant of the stadium bounced like mad.\nAdvertisement\nThen the Germans decided they couldn\u2019t bear to join the roster of defending World Cup champions who fizzle the next time, seemingly exhausted, such as France in 2002 and Italy in 2010 and Spain in 2014. They got Werner\u2019s surge on the left by Gomez\u2019s foot to Reus\u2019s knee and into the left edge of the goal in the 48th.\nThen they spent the rest straining to avoid that draw. They had chances in the 49th minute, the 51st, 56th, 61st, 66th, 72nd, 81st, 88th and 92nd. They had Kroos going just wide, Thomas Mueller heading just wide, Werner flying around on the left, Werner to Jonas Hector, Joshua Kimmich to Werner but then Werner\u2019s shot over the goal, Olsen\u2019s save on Gomez, Brandt\u2019s strike to the post.\nThen, with a 1-1 draw and on one point in the group, with Sweden on four and Mexico on six and those two due to play each other next week, the Germans were done for the night and just about done for good.\nAdvertisement\nThen, they weren\u2019t.\nThey had drifted into such trouble, and clambered out of it so dramatically, that on a night that looked so unfamiliar, it hardly looked like Germany.\n\u2014Chuck Culpepper\n***\nWhat\u2019s next\nGermany: vs. South Korea in Kazan, Wednesday, 10 a.m.\nSweden: vs. Mexico in Ekaterinburg, Wednesday, 10 a.m.\n***\nIn-game updates\nGooooaaaalllll!\nSeconds before full time, Germany\u2019s Toni Kroos scored off a free kick.

The lone goal in that loss came in the 35th minute, when 22-year-old Hirving Lozano picked up Javier Hernandez\u2019s pass inside the penalty area and beat a defender before scoring on Germany\u2019s goalkeeper, Manuel Neuer. The result sent shock waves through Mexico, literally, creating what may have been an artificial man-made earthquake in Mexico, while it left Germany\u2019s future at this World Cup uncertain.\nMexico plays South Korea earlier Saturday; if the favored El Tri earn at least a draw, Germany could be eliminated with a loss against Sweden.

It was the first time the Swedes had won their opening World Cup match since 1958, against \u2014 that\u2019s right \u2014 Mexico.

He missed most of the Bundesliga season with a foot injury before returning to the national team this month.

Before the wheels lifted off the runway at Oakland International Airport on Friday, Hawaiian Airlines Flight 23 hit some . . . emotional turbulence, when more than a dozen passengers received what appeared to be a photo of a macabre crime scene: a lifeless body, facedown, surrounded by dried blood spatter, bullet casings and evidence markers. Terrified, the passengers alerted airline personnel to the \u201cthreatening\u201d photo \u2014 which turned out to be from a teenager's forensic science project, according to reporting from the Mercury News.\nA 15-year-old girl had tried to share the image with her mother via AirDrop \u2014 an iPhone file-sharing method that uses Bluetooth to share photos with nearby devices \u2014 but also made it available to nearby passengers by accident. The plane had already began taxiing, but the pilot returned to the gate after being notified of the photos, delaying the flight an hour and a half while the incident unraveled. The girl and her mother were questioned by Alameda County sheriff's deputies but were cleared of any crime. Sgt.

People were being highly vigilant.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nUltimately, the girl and her mother were booked on a later flight \u2014 which might have been for the better, given what followed.\nHawaiian Airlines Flight 23 would eventually take flight Friday, bearing 256 passengers and 10 crew members. As it glided over the Pacific Ocean, people started complaining about a strange stink spreading throughout the cabin. Midway through the five-hour flight, several passengers began to cough, holding shirts over their mouths, according to tweets from one passenger, Lisa Sakimura, who narrated the entire affair once the plane landed. People called for help and begged for air.\nThen the coughing gets louder. I hear a burly man yell in the back through chokes to \u201cdrop the air!\u201d over and over.

Passengers were given wet napkins to cover their mouths. A baby choked and vomited, said Sakimura, who did not immediately respond to a tweet seeking comment.\nAdvertisement\nThe passengers were trapped with the noxious odor for nearly two hours, until the plane was cleared for an expedited landing and touched down safely in Maui, according to reporting from Hawaii News Now. Officials discovered the mysterious contaminate was a leaky 1.5-ounce can of pepper spray in a passenger's luggage. Bringing pepper spray in a carry-on is illegal, but this canister somehow made it through security at the airport in Oakland.\n\"We know what the cause is,\u201d a firefighter reassured the rattled passengers in a cellphone video taken after the emergency landing. \u201cEveryone is okay.\"\nFirst responders treated 15 people for respiratory issues and have released all of them, Hawaiian Airlines told Hawaii News Now.

Mark Geragos was earning a worldwide rep for defending the most reviled man in America inside a courtroom in Modesto, Calif., when his beeper started screaming. The business at hand was serious enough without digital distractions. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight That April, the murdered remains of a missing 27-year-old pregnant woman named Laci Peterson splashed ashore on San Francisco Bay. Police charged the victim\u2019s husband, Scott Peterson, a philandering fertilizer salesman who authorities said killed his wife and unborn son. Most legal experts and TV pundits said the evidence stacked against Peterson made an acquittal a long shot \u2014 an opinion echoed by Geragos on cable TV, until the mustachioed and media-savvy Los Angeles attorney decided to represent him.\nBut as he was in court with Peterson, his pager kept going off. The calls were to alert the attorney that another client, pop star Michael Jackson, had just been served search warrants at his Neverland Ranch. Two days later, Geragos walked Jackson into a police station in Santa Barbara, Calif., where he was charged with child molestation.\nAdvertisement\nGeragos was suddenly thrust front and center in the country\u2019s two most high-profile criminal cases. And his beeper did not shut up. Over a 24-hour period that week, his pager buzzed 700 times, Geragos told the New York Times.\n\u201cAt one point, I thought of throwing it in the ocean,\u201d the attorney explained to the Times. \u201cTo some degree it is embarrassing. I suppose because I don\u2019t think any of this is about me. It is about the client. Hopefully it passes and passes quickly.\u201d\nGeragos, however, never slipped back below the radar.\nOver the past two decades, he\u2019s become the go-to attorney for the rich and famous. His client list evokes a tabloid rundown of celebrity mug shots: actor Robert Downey Jr.; actress Winona Ryder; rapper Nate Dogg; presidential sibling Roger Clinton; pop star Chris Brown. Just in the last year, Geragos secured a settlement for Colin Kaepernick in his lawsuit against the NFL and also stepped in to defend \u201cEmpire\u201d actor Jussie Smollett against charges he faked a hate crime. The Rolodex of big-name clients, combined with regular cable news appearances, have made Geragos one of the most recognized figures in American law.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to represent somebody, I think at the very least they deserve someone who can find the good in them,\u201d Geragos told the Los Angeles Times in 2003. \u201cI don\u2019t think most people are evil. I think sometimes people are demonized unfairly.\u201d\nBut Geragos is now in his own surprising legal jam.\nOn Monday, federal authorities arrested attorney Michael Avenatti, the former lawyer for adult-film actress Stormy Daniels. As The Washington Post reported, one indictment against the attorney accuses Avenatti of trying to extort millions of dollars from Nike. Citing sources close to the investigation, The Post reported Geragos is the unnamed \u201cco-conspirator\u201d alleged to have worked the scheme with Avenatti. Following the news, CNN announced it was dropping Geragos as an on-air contributor.\nAvenatti has denied the charges. Geragos, who has not been charged, did not respond to an email for comment.\nAdvertisement\nBut the link between Avenatti and Geragos goes beyond Monday\u2019s allegations. Both are on-camera naturals fueled by an underdog ethos. And Geragos first landed in the national spotlight in the 1990s by walking into a political firestorm that led right to the White House \u2014 circumstances not unlike those that catapulted Avenatti into national recognition over the last year.\nLaw was in Geragos\u2019s blood. His family were members of Los Angeles\u2019s close Armenian American community. His father worked as a district attorney before entering private practice.\n\u201cMy father was sworn in as a D.A. in January 1957, the same month I was conceived,\u201d Geragos told Super Lawyers in 2009. As a kid, Geragos would sit in courtrooms and watch as his father\u2019s cases unfold, an experience that fixed his own trajectory toward the courthouse.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cYou could get paid for shooting your mouth off and not much else,\u201d he told Super Lawyers.\nGeragos studied anthropology and sociology at Haverford College, then after graduation entered Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. While studying law, he worked up a side business as a rock concert promoter in Pasadena, booking shows for acts such as the Ramones, the Pretenders, and the Go-Go\u2019s, according to Super Lawyers. In 1983, he began working at his father\u2019s firm.\n\u201cHe was always a very public kind of person,\u201d Stanley A. Goldman, a friend and former law professor, told the New York Times in 2003. \u201c[H]e claims he rarely showed up for class because he was organizing rock concerts. I like Mark Geragos. A lot of people don\u2019t. He can be extremely pushy.\u201d\nGeragos\u2019s first splash into mainstream news came more than a decade later, when he began representing a woman at the center of a presidential scandal then dominating national headlines.\nAdvertisement\nSusan McDougal was a former business partner of President Bill Clinton on the failed Whitewater real estate deal. When McDougal refused to testify before a grand jury called by independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, she was sentenced to 18 months in prison for civil contempt beginning in 1996.\nUpon release, McDougal was charged again for criminal contempt and obstruction of justice. At the suggestion of his father, Geragos stepped in to her defense. As he explained to the New York Times, Geragos took the case pro bono, explaining to McDougal that because of his Armenian background, he \u201chad a special appreciation for victims of government oppression.\u201d\nWhen McDougal went to trial in Little Rock in 1999, the cornerstone of Geragos\u2019s case was that his client had been railroaded in retaliation for not cooperating in Starr\u2019s \u201cvendetta\u201d against the Clintons. The proceedings started less than a month after Clinton was acquitted at his impeachment trial in the Senate.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI fully intend to put Kenneth W. Starr on trial,\u201d Geragos told reporters at the start of the case, The Post reported at the time.\nThe attorney made more headlines by grilling Starr deputy W. Hickman Ewing Jr. on the witness stand. Under Geragos\u2019s questioning, Ewing admitted he had drafted an indictment against Hillary Clinton during the Starr investigation.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like that she was evasive,\u201d Ewing testified, according to Super Lawyers.\n\u201cSort of like you right now?,\u201d Geragos snapped back.\nThe jury acquitted McDougal on the obstruction of justice charge and deadlocked on the criminal contempt charge. Geragos was defiant on the steps of the courthouse. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the guts to retry it,\u201d he said, the Los Angeles Times reported in 2003. He eventually worked to get McDougal a full pardon in the last hours of Clinton\u2019s presidency.\nAdvertisement\nAs Avenatti\u2019s representation of Daniels in her lawsuit against President Trump over an alleged affair punched the attorney\u2019s ticket into cable news green rooms, Geragos\u2019s work for McDougal elevated his career to a new level.\n\u201cI always tease him about my case launching him into the limelight,\u201d McDougal told the New York Times in 2003. \u201cHe was just absolutely perfect.\u201d\nUnlike Avenatti, Geragos spun the attention into a busy practice \u2014 too busy, some critics said. In 2003, when he was shuttling up and down California defending both Jackson and Peterson, the pop star eventually replaced him. He continued leading Peterson\u2019s defense, but lost the case; the husband was sentenced to death row.\nBut those setbacks have not kept his phone from buzzing whenever a high-profile personality is in trouble \u2014 including Avenatti. According to the Hollywood Reporter, when Avenatti was arrested over an alleged domestic violence situation last November, he consulted with Geragos about the charges. (Prosecutors declined to file any charges related to the incident.)\nAdvertisement\nBut if the recent indictment is correct, the two attorneys\u2019 relationship continued last week, when Avenatti and Geragos allegedly approached Nike, threatening to expose employees for funneling payments to top high school basketball players and their families.\nThe indictment alleges the attorneys demanded the company to hire them both to conduct an internal investigation into the issue for $15 million to $25 million. Should the case move forward, both attorneys will likely seek representation cut from the same mold \u2014 a vociferous, TV-ready advocate.\n\u201cI do take seriously the idea that you\u2019re not supposed to turn down a case just because of its notoriety,\u201dGeragos once told the Los Angeles Times.\nMore from Morning Mix:\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

(Video: Reuters)\nComment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Tuesday scheduled a pair of competing votes to reopen the federal government, announcing that he would bring up dueling proposals from President Trump and the Democrats that would amount to the first real action in the Senate since the shutdown began a month ago.\nNeither measure looked likely to win the support from 60 senators needed to advance, and instead the votes Thursday threatened to accomplish little more than to provide each side with new ammunition to accuse the other of prolonging the nation\u2019s longest government shutdown. The result could be only to prove that some other solution is needed to end the partial shutdown, even as 800,000 federal workers face the loss of a second straight paycheck Friday.\nTrump\u2019s proposal, which the president announced in a weekend speech from the White House, would open the government through Sept. 30 while providing $5.7 billion for a border wall and giving temporary deportation protections to about 1 million unauthorized immigrants. But it also contains stringent changes to the nation\u2019s asylum rules, and Democrats who were already united against funding Trump\u2019s wall described these asylum provisions Tuesday as a new poison pill.\nThe Democrats\u2019 plan is a stopgap spending bill that would fund the government through Feb. 8 without providing any new money for the wall. That would let both parties negotiate on border security while the government is reopened, a respite Democrats have been demanding.\nAdvertisement\nBut the White House has consistently opposed reopening the government without getting wall money. And most Republicans have fallen in line with that stance, even though the Senate passed nearly identical legislation shortly before the shutdown began. At the time, many believed that Trump would support the proposal, only to see him publicly oppose it the next day.\nThursday\u2019s planned votes are a product of an agreement between McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). But even as the leaders announced the deal, they traded barbs in speeches on the Senate floor. McConnell accused Democrats of rejecting a reasonable proposal from Trump because of political opposition to the president, and Schumer argued that Republicans and Trump were operating in bad faith by including new asylum curbs and failing to consult with Democrats.\n\u201cOn one side of the scale we have all of my Democratic colleagues\u2019 declarations that we must reopen the rest of the federal government and get federal workers their paychecks . . . And we have their stated desire to help out a number of individuals with a more certain immigration status,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThat\u2019s one side of the scale. All that\u2019s on the other side is the far left\u2019s political animus for the occupant of the White House. It is high time to get serious.\u201d\nMembers of Congress discussed ways to break the funding impasse on Jan. 20, the 30th day of a partial government shutdown. (Video: Patrick Martin/The Washington Post)\nAdvertisement\nSchumer disputed McConnell\u2019s remarks.\n\u201cNow the president said his proposal was a reasonable compromise. In fact it is neither reasonable nor a compromise,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cThere was no serious negotiation with any Democrat about what went into the proposal. That\u2019s because the proposal was never intended to pass. It\u2019s only a thinly veiled attempt by the president to save face.\u201d\nThe acrimony on display on the Senate floor came as warnings intensified about the shutdown\u2019s economic consequences, and federal agencies such as the Transportation Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service struggled to conduct their basic duties.\nSome employees who are not getting paid but are supposed to report to work anyway because their duties have been deemed essential chose to stay home. Lawmakers from Virginia and Maryland, with large concentrations of federal workers, issued increasingly desperate calls for the shutdown to be over with \u2014 and yet there was still no end in sight.\nAdvertisement\nHoping to entice some Democrats to support his new proposal, Trump offered a three-year pause in his efforts to scrap rules that shield some immigrants from deportation. The rules are a Democratic priority, as they protect the \u201cdreamers,\u201d a group that includes 700,000 young people brought illegally to the United States as children, who won temporary deportation protections under the Obama-era program formally known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).\nBut Democrats accused Trump of offering a short-term solution to a problem he himself caused, and the Supreme Court on Tuesday weakened Trump\u2019s hand, taking no action to review lower-court rulings that had blocked Trump from ending DACA. If the court sticks to its normal procedures, even accepting the case at a later date would probably mean the justices would not hear arguments until the court\u2019s new term starts in October. That would probably keep the program in place until at least next year.\nWith the court seemingly keeping the program safe for at least a year, Trump\u2019s offer to suspend his efforts to end it became less appealing to lawmakers who were already skeptical.\nAdvertisement\nDemocratic opposition to Trump\u2019s proposal further solidified Tuesday as Democratic lawmakers and immigration activists dug into the Senate legislation and discovered that it contains dramatic new limits on the U.S. asylum program.\nThe legislation specifies that children younger than 18 from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala could not apply for asylum at the U.S. border and instead would be turned away, because of a new requirement that they apply from their home countries. The law would also set a new cap of 15,000 on the number of children who could qualify each year for the asylum program.\nAdditionally, the legislation says children could qualify for asylum only if they had a U.S.-based guardian to care for them. Immigration experts said the changes would effectively bar Central American minors arriving at U.S. borders from access to asylum.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s an enormous restriction,\u201d said Greg Chen, director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cIt pretty much shuts down access to asylum for Central American minors arriving at U.S. borders and will force thousands of children back into life-threatening danger.\u201d\nA spokesman for McConnell\u2019s office directed questions about the proposed asylum changes to the administration. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment.\nMeanwhile, House Democrats announced fresh plans to pass legislation this week that would reopen the government while blocking new wall funding, but Trump has repeatedly rejected similar bills, and McConnell has said the Senate won\u2019t take them up \u2014 leading Republicans, newly consigned to powerlessness in the House minority, to question why they were engaging in the exercise at all.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cDoing the same thing over and over is not likely to get us there,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole \u00ad(R-Okla.).\nThe impasse has left key parts of the federal government unfunded for more than a month, including the Treasury, Homeland Security, Interior, Agriculture and Justice departments. It has also threatened important government services, leaving the White House to repeatedly attempt to find ways to keep unfunded parts of the government functioning.\nBut Trump and his chief negotiating rival, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), both promised Tuesday morning that they would not give in.\nIn a morning post on Twitter, the president accused Democrats of playing \u201cpolitical games,\u201d exclaimed \u201cNo Cave!\u201d and argued that construction of a wall along the Mexican border would lead to substantially lower crime rates and fewer drugs coming into the United States.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWithout a Wall our Country can never have Border or National Security,\u201d Trump wrote.\nIn response, Pelosi accused Trump and McConnell of \u201cholding Americans hostage\u201d by not acting on the House bills.\nIn a statement later in the day, she added: \u201cSenate Republicans need to re-open government, not continue their complicity in the Trump Shutdown with a vote for the President\u2019s unacceptable border and immigration schemes that only increase the chaos and suffering at the border.\u201d\nThe Senate bill incorporates a few elements aimed at winning Democratic support, including some new humanitarian aid, $12.7 billion in hurricane and wildfire disaster relief, and the three-year protections for about 700,000 dreamers, as well as 300,000 immigrants who came to the United States following natural disasters or other calamities in their home countries and who won \u201ctemporary protected status,\u201d a designation Trump is also moving to phase out.\nAdvertisement\nIn announcing his proposal in the White House speech Saturday, Trump touted it as a \u201ccommon-sense compromise both parties should embrace.\u201d\n\u201cOur plan includes critical measures to protect migrant children from exploitation and abuse,\u201d Trump said, in a mention of the new asylum provisions. \u201cThis includes a new system to allow Central American minors to apply for asylum in their home countries, and reform to promote family reunification for unaccompanied children, thousands of whom wind up on our border doorstep.\u201d\nBut the changes cracking down on asylum seekers and other pieces of the immigration system drew angry and widespread condemnation from immigration activists.\nWendy Young, president of Kids in Need of Defense, a group that works with unaccompanied immigrant youths, said that under the proposed changes, \u201ckids will lose their lives, plain and simple.\u201d\nThe legislation would also double fees for young immigrants to apply for protection under DACA and create new income requirements to qualify, in effect preventing very poor immigrants from being able to apply, according to United We Dream, a group that supports dreamers.\nAnd it would increase by 20 percent the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency\u2019s budget for detention and enforcement, said Heidi Altman, director of policy at the National Immigrant Justice Center. This money could fund an additional 2,000 new ICE officers and 750 new border agents.\nBut the legislation also faces opposition from some on the right, including conservative commentator Ann Coulter, who has described it as \u201camnesty.\u201d\nAnd some immigration restrictionists said they would like to see the legislation go even farther. For example, the proposal would allow the administration to tighten the process that allows asylum seekers to claim they have a \u201ccredible fear\u201d of persecution in their home countries, said Chris Chmielenski, a spokesman for NumbersUSA, an advocacy firm that favors tighter immigration rules.\nBut NumbersUSA wants those changes to be made permanent in the Senate GOP proposal, along with changes that would allow the Department of Homeland Security to deport unaccompanied minors not from Canada or Mexico back to their home countries.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t go far enough,\u201d Chmielenski said.\nRobert Barnes contributed to this report.\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

Choose your plan ArrowRight There was no immediate indication as to who may have been responsible or why the damage was inflicted, but the incidents occurred at the same time and place off the coast of the United Arab Emirates only days after the United States has dispatched warships and bombers to the area to deter alleged threats from Iran.\nThe location is near a sea lane critical to the world\u2019s supply of oil, and the incidents followed a warning by U.S. maritime authorities that Iran might seek to disrupt commercial shipping in the area.\nOne of the Saudi tankers had been preparing to deliver oil to the United States, and both incurred \u201csignificant damage\u201d as a result of the apparent attack at around 6 a.m. Sunday morning, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said in a statement reported by the official Saudi news agency.\nA statement from Thome Ship Management, the owners of the Norwegian-flagged vessel, said an \u201cunknown object\u201d had created a hole in the hull of one of its ships, the MT Andrea Victory. Photographs of the ship showing a hole just above the waterline have been published, according to the Associated Press.\nAdvertisement\nNeither Saudi Arabia nor the United Arab Emirates produced photographs to support claims that Saudi tankers had been damaged. Falih said the apparent attacks did not cause any casualties or oil spills, and they did not attribute blame for the apparent sabotage.\nIn a May 8 televised address, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said his country would stop complying with parts of the landmark nuclear deal. (Video: Associated Press)\nThe incidents coincide, however, with a surge in U.S.-Iranian tensions after the United States said last week that it has received intelligence that Iran was planning some kind of attack on U.S. forces in the Middle East.\nIn response to the threat, the Pentagon dispatched reinforcements to the Persian Gulf, including an aircraft carrier, a Patriot missile battery and a squadron of B-52 bombers. The moves prompted Iran to warn that it is prepared to retaliate if it is attacked.\nIran\u2019s Foreign Ministry condemned the possible shipping attacks as \u201calarming and regrettable\u201d and said it would have a \u201cnegative effect\u201d on shipping safety and maritime security, according to the Iranian Students\u2019 News Agency.\nAdvertisement\nAbbas Mousavi, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, suggested that the sabotage might have been carried out as part of a conspiracy to ignite conflict in the region. He cautioned against what he called \u201cplots by ill-wishers to disrupt regional security\u201d and called for an inquiry.\nIran also announced last week that it would pull out of parts of its 2015 nuclear deal with major world powers and step up uranium enrichment, raising concern among the accord\u2019s remaining signatories that it will soon collapse altogether.\nSpeaking in Brussels, British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt warned of the risk that the tensions could trigger an unintended conflict in the region.\n\u201cWe are very worried about the risk of a conflict happening by accident with an escalation that is unintended,\u201d he told reporters ahead of a European Union meeting later Monday about ways to salvage the deal.\nThe spike in tensions comes after the Trump administration\u2019s decision to lift sanctions waivers from eight countries that import Iranian oil, in a bid to bring Iran\u2019s exports down to \u201czero,\u201d according to U.S. officials. Iranian imports had already plunged after the United States reimposed sanctions in November, following the Trump administration\u2019s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear accord. The expiration of the waivers is expected to inflict further pain on Iran\u2019s already reeling economy.\nAdvertisement\nIt was not immediately clear whether the two Saudi vessels that were damaged were among four ships that the United Arab Emirates said Sunday were sabotaged in the same area. Hours before the UAE reported the damage to the ships, Iran-linked news outlets had circulated reports that a big attack on the port at Fujairah had set fire to seven ships. Those have since been proved false.\nThe U.S. maritime authority reissued an earlier warning after the Sunday attacks that Iran might seek to target commercial shipping in the area, the Associated Press reported.\n\u201cSince early May, there is an increased possibility that Iran and/or its regional proxies could take action against U.S. and partner interests, including oil production infrastructure, after recently threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz,\u201d an earlier warning issued last week said. \u201cIran or its proxies could respond by targeting commercial vessels, including oil tankers, or U.S. military vessels in the Red Sea, Bab-el-Mandeb Strait or the Persian Gulf.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe State Department also updated a travel advisory to U.S. citizens in Iraq on Monday that was issued in the wake of the rising tensions last week.

Rosenstein assured Jordan that the FBI was doing everything in its power to respond to the House of Representatives' requests. (Video: Reuters)\nGift Article Share\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) is the Republicans' designated attack dog on the House Judiciary Committee. He's the guy pushing conspiracy theories about the FBI and President Trump. And he's the guy whose push for a second special counsel based on these theories earned a sharp rebuke from Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\nOn Thursday, Jordan again found himself getting shut down by one of the embattled leaders of the Justice Department \u2014 this time in somewhat embarrassing fashion.\nIn a tense exchange, Jordan suggested that Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who oversees special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's Russia investigation and has earned Trump's ire, was withholding key information from Congress about the probe. Jordan badgered Rosenstein for several minutes, clearly trying to get under his skin. And it worked, to some degree, with Rosenstein at one point saying, \u201cYour use of this to attack me personally is deeply wrong.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nBut then things fell apart for Jordan, and he undermined his own case. He turned to media reports about an alleged threat by Rosenstein to members of Congress. Fox News's Catherine Herridge reported June 12 that Rosenstein had threatened to \u201c 'subpoena' emails, phone records and other documents from lawmakers and staff on\u201d the GOP-controlled House Intelligence Committee. That's the committee led by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) that has been doing Trump's bidding in a way that its Senate counterpart simply hasn't, including releasing the \u201cNunes memo.\u201d Other conservative outlets have run with the claim, but outlets such as CNN and even Sessions have said it didn't happen.\nAfter Rosenstein rebuked Jordan's use of anonymous media reports, Jordan read from a quote that one anonymous House committee staffer gave to Fox.\n\u201cThis is what they said: 'Having the nation's number one law enforcement officer threaten to subpoena your calls and emails is downright chilling,' \u201d Jordan said. \u201cDid you threaten to subpoena their calls and emails?\u201d\nAdvertisement\n\u201cNo, sir, and there's no way to subpoena phone calls,\u201d Rosenstein said, clearly pleased with himself.\nThere were audible laughs in the room.\nJordan stumbled for what to say next \u2014 \u201cWell, I mean, I'm reading what the press said\u201d \u2014 before pressing Rosenstein on what he said. Rosenstein flatly denied that he had ever said it and noted that he was under oath. He challenged the sources who claim he threatened people to also say so under oath.\nThe subpoena distinction is a technical one, to be sure; while you can subpoena phone records, you can't subpoena phone calls. But Jordan was clearly knocked off his game and for some reason didn't even try to make that distinction. It's also a quote that suggests the staffer didn't exactly know what they were talking about.\nAnd the attempted undermining of the Russia investigation suffered another setback.\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose mastery of social media has helped drive the national conversation and shed light on the inner workings of congressional power, has given up on the most popular social network in the world. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight In an interview Sunday with the Yahoo News podcast \u201cSkullduggery,\u201d the New York Democrat said she stopped using her Facebook account and was scaling back on all social media, which she described as a \u201cpublic health risk\u201d because it can lead to \u201cincreased isolation, depression, anxiety, addiction, escapism.\u201d\nOcasio-Cortez, 29, who burst onto the national stage after defeating a high-ranking incumbent, said her departure from Facebook was a \u201cbig deal\u201d because the platform had been crucial to her campaign. She still has accounts on the site, she said, and according to the company\u2019s ad library, her official Facebook account has dozens of active advertisements sponsored by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for Congress. Among the ads are calls to support her signature Green New Deal, and fundraising pleas to support progressive legislation and to counteract a super PAC aligned against her.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe congresswoman\u2019s words speak for themselves,\u201d said Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez.\nOcasio-Cortez joins other prominent users who have given up on the social network, including WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, who sold his company to Facebook in 2014, and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Both technologists parted ways with the social network amid a user boycott and as the company faced a congressional inquiry over the Cambridge Analytica controversy, when it was revealed that the political firm had improperly obtained personal information from millions of Facebook users.\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s disengagement from Facebook also tracks broad trends in social media use among young people. According to a 2018 Pew Research Center study, Facebook\u2019s popularity among teens has plunged in recent years. Roughly half of the nation\u2019s teenagers say they use Facebook, compared with 71 percent in 2015.\nThe hashtag #deletefacebook is trending on Twitter after Facebook's Cambridge Analytica controversy. Here's a guide on how to leave the social media site. (Video: Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post, Photo: Kathleen Rudell-Brooks/The Washington Post)\nYouTube, Instagram and Snapchat have now overtaken Facebook as the most popular social media networks, the study found.\nAdvertisement\nAfter a rolling series of scandals involving the misuse of personal data, hateful content and misinformation, many Facebook users have also changed the way they use the platform. A separate Pew Research survey found that 74 percent of U.S. adult Facebook users have done one of the following: changed their privacy settings, taken a break from the platform or deleted it.\nDespite Facebook\u2019s troubles, the social network has recently gained daily active users in the U.S. and Canada, according to the company\u2019s most recent earnings report. Prior to the last quarter of 2018, Facebook\u2019s user numbers in its most important market had flatlined, with most of its growth coming from countries outside of North America and Europe. Facebook counted 1.52 billion daily users, on average, an increase of 9 percent from the end of 2017.\nThe figures suggest that some of the people who abandoned the platform have returned and that the company is still attracting new users.\nAdvertisement\nThough the company continues to post strong returns, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg continues to find himself under scrutiny. Last year, he was called to testify before Congress, enduring 10 hours of questioning tied to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. And it\u2019s currently negotiating a multibillion-dollar fine with the Federal Trade Commission to settle the agency\u2019s investigation into its privacy practices.\nMeanwhile, European regulators have criticized Zuckerberg\u2019s new plan to merge the company\u2019s messaging platforms \u2014 Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger \u2014 citing antitrust concerns.\nDuring her podcast interview, Ocasio-Cortez pointed to negative health consequences as a reason to scale back on social platforms.\n\u201cI actually think that social media poses a public health risk to everybody,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are amplified impacts for young people, particularly children under the age of 3 with screen time. But I think it has a lot of effects on older people. I think it has effects on everybody. Increased isolation, depression, anxiety, addiction, escapism.\u201d\nOcasio-Cortez, who writes all of her own tweets and Instagram posts, said she\u2019s trying to limit her consumption of social media to the workweek. \u201cLike every once in a while, you\u2019ll see me hop on Twitter on the weekends, but for the most part, I take consumption of content, when it comes to consumption and reading, I take the weekends off.\u201d\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

Back in November Bell rebranded Crave TV to Crave. Along with the name change, the company also revamped the platform\u2019s user interface and launched a $9.99 subscription tier that adds current HBO content to the platform.\nSubscribing to the $9.99 base level tier and then adding the additional $9.99 \u2018Movies + HBO\u2019 tier gives you access to live and currently airing HBO content like Game of Thrones Season 8. This brings the total monthly subscription cost to $19.98.\nTo subscribe, navigate to Crave.ca and click on \u2018Sign In.\u2019 Next, click \u2018Subscribe now!\u2018 and type your email address and create a password. You\u2019ll then be given two subscription options, either $9.99 monthly or $99.90 a year. The next screen allows you to add Movies + HBO for an additional $9.99 a month, as well as Starz content for $5.99 per month.\nMovies + HBO subscriptions cost $9.99 per month or $99.90 annually. Starz, which isn\u2019t necessary to watch Game of Thrones, can be subscribed to for $5.99 per month or $59.90 annually.\nOnce you\u2019ve moved through these steps, you\u2019ll be able to watch Game of Thrones Season 8.\nBell says that new episodes of Game of Thrones will stream at 9pm ET/6pm PT every Sunday as the same time as the show airs on HBO\u2019s cable channel. You can also watch every new episode of season 8 live if you navigate to the \u2018On Air\u2019 area of the HBO section in the Crave app.\nCrave is available on iOS, Android, desktop and Xbox One. A PlayStation 4 Crave app is not yet available, though Bell has repeatedly stated it plans to bring the streaming service to the platform in the future.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Crave now streams in 1080p on iOS, Android and Xbox One. Previously stream quality was locked to 720p for most content, with Apple\u2019s 4th-generation Apple TV being the only device to support 1080p.",
    "https://thewire.in/film/veere-di-wedding-review": "Veere Di Wedding is centred on four close friends \u2013 Kalindi (Kareena Kapoor Khan), Avni (Sonam Kapoor), Sakshi (Swara Bhaskar), and Meera (Shikha Talsania) \u2013 who are caught in varying degrees of confusion and trouble. Kalindi is about to get married to Rishabh (Sumeeet Vyas), a guy she\u2019s been dating for three years, but she\u2019s not sure. She loves him and he loves her too, she says, but what does that have to do with marriage? Avni, a lawyer, is constantly pressurised by her mother (Neena Gupta) to get married. Sakshi is about to divorce her husband and, for the same reason, doesn\u2019t get along with her parents. Meera, the mother of a two-year-old boy, is happily married to an American, living a content life, but she hasn\u2019t spoken to her uncle, her long-time guardian, in years. This bunch is meeting after long, in Delhi, for Kalindi\u2019s wedding.\nHindi films haven\u2019t had a long history of female ensembles. Of late though, a few films, such as Angry Indian Goddesses, Parched, and Lipstick Under My Burkha, have bucked that trend. These films, barring Angry Indian Goddess\u2019 awful climax, have been entertaining and intense, but it wasn\u2019t hard to gauge that they for various reasons, either due to astute marketing or straightjacketed expectations, were primarily projected and seen as \u2018feminist\u2019 dramas \u2013 the implication being that a movie with an all-female cast had to be \u2018something\u2019, that it couldn\u2019t be itself, a film like any other trying to tell an entertaining story. To be fair, those films were label friendly to an extent, with their plots and resolutions clearly feminist in nature.\n\ufeff\nVeere Di Wedding, however, is a much simpler film \u2013 if you want to be blunt, you can call it a much dumber film. Here the protagonists are privileged and shallow, their engagement with the world is limited to failed relationships. That may sound like a demerit, but it also frees the film from the baggage of ideology and representation, allowing it to find its way. And when Veere Di Wedding does find its way, when it is at its finest, it brings the house down.\nSakshi is, by far, the most rambunctious of the lot. Perpetually smoking cigarettes or downing drinks, she has little regard for propriety. Bhaskar, who usually plays hard-hitting characters, slips into this role with ease and seems to be having a lot of fun. Her Sakshi is what most good characters are: consistent, compelling, unpredictable. Even Kalindi and Meera (Talsania is wonderful) are well-written characters. (#SpoilerAlert: Sonam Kapoor still can\u2019t act and threatens to ruin the movie every time she\u2019s in the frame).\nThe joy of watching Veere Di Wedding is the joy of watching several firsts. It feels liberating to see female characters just be in a Bollywood drama. Unlike most films, here their conversations don\u2019t revolve around men. In fact, some of them hide things from each other. Early in the film, Sakshi is in her car, berating her parents over the phone. When Meera enters the car, asking who was on the phone, Sakshi replies, \u201cOh nothing, Airtel.\u201d\nThen much later Meera, while vacationing in Phuket with her friends, reveals an embarrassing personal detail of her life. Many scenes in Veere Di Wedding have an infectious, life-like quality to them, like eavesdropping on a conversation among close friends. Scenes often flow in and out of each other easily. The characters and their conversations, as a result, aren\u2019t substitutes for ideologies.\nVeere Di Wedding accumulates its victories slowly. They are in scenes where an expensive wedding dress \u2013 or the wedding itself \u2013 isn\u2019t an end in itself, in bits where Meera gets annoyed by her son (motherhood cannot vanquish your own self), in portions where Kalindi derides the marriage\u2019s patriarchal norms. This should be the default level for such a ginormous and profitable film industry, but Bollywood is particularly slow to change, so even basic efforts seem path breaking.\nA film that makes you laugh \u2013 and Veere Di Wedding does that a lot till its first half \u2013 becomes easy to like. So when its flaws start to appear to the point that they threaten to outsize its merits, it causes more disappointment than usual. Veere Di Wedding revels in its comedic strains, but sometimes it tries too hard, and the outcome is silly and contrived. For instance, it\u2019s one thing to show Sakshi as a chain smoker, it\u2019s quite the other to show her with a cigarette all the time (even inside a mall). Similarly, Khan, who is otherwise fine in the film, has a tendency to act for the camera, making funny, exasperated expressions even when she\u2019s by herself. Neena Gupta\u2019s character, too, overdoes her marriage fixation. Since Veere Di Wedding is primarily a comedy, it is always looking to milk any funny scenario, but such efforts, when not backed by credible writing, start looking trite. What\u2019s worse: their triteness is easily evident.\nThe film is particularly weak in its final segment, when it tries to give some shape \u2013 an overarching sense of seriousness \u2013 to this freewheeling drama. These scenes, dealing with different familial misunderstandings \u2013 between a father and a daughter, an uncle and a niece, two brothers \u2013 should have been well written, showing how family dynamics can be complex, fluctuating, and even absurd at times.\nInstead we get plot turns that seem too convenient and neat, rushing to wrap up the film. Besides, the individual outcomes of the characters\u2019 stories, which more or less confirm the status quo, are disappointing. Veere Di Wedding needn\u2019t have gone anywhere else for inspiration, its first half \u2013 breezy, unruly, bawdy \u2013 would have been cue enough.",

Then you\u2019re trying to get your guys motivated. This is a good tournament, but how do you convince your guys of that? If we could\u2019ve won this game, it probably would have been the biggest win in our postseason history.\u201d\nThere is one major selling point \u2013 namely punching a ticket to New York City and the famed basketball mecca of Madison Square Garden.\n\u201cThe NIT\u2019s not a bad tournament,\u201d Reed said. \u201cKeep winning and you go to Madison Square Garden where most of the greats have played.\u201d\nClemson has advanced to New York three times previously and lost in the NIT Championship Game twice, most recently in 2007.\nThe allure of a possible bite of the Big Apple is there and the pursuit of that may serve as a salve to a team on the outside looking in at the real March Madness.\n\u201cThe guys on the team watch games there, they\u2019ve heard about it,\u201d Brownell said. \u201cSo the chance to do that is a significant accomplishment.

TSN's Josh Lewenberg has more.\nJosh Lewenberg TSN Raptors Reporter Follow| Archive\nTORONTO \u2013 With his team trailing the Milwaukee Bucks 2-0 in the Eastern Conference Finals, Toronto Raptors head coach Nick Nurse is contemplating making multiple lineup changes ahead of Sunday\u2019s crucial Game 3.\n\u201cI think there could be more than one lineup change coming at us,\u201d he said on a conference call Saturday afternoon before hedging a bit. \u201cI think your question here is this: Are you gonna dance with the one you brought to the ball? It's not easy.\u201d\n\u201cI kinda trust these guys, know who they are, believe in them, and know they're better than they played [Friday] night and have shown that on bounce-back situations usually.\u201d\nAfter a fourth-quarter collapse cost them a game they felt they could have, and arguably should have won in Wednesday\u2019s series opener, the Raptors were demolished in Game 2, falling 125-103 in Milwaukee on Friday.\nWhile he certainly wasn\u2019t the only Raptors player to underperform, Marc Gasol\u2019s slow start helped fuel the Bucks\u2019 early run. The veteran centre missed his first four shots, getting blocked on two of them, and committed a couple bad turnovers as Milwaukee scored the first nine points of the night and went on to win wire-to-wire.\n\u201cI played really bad and that set the tone,\u201d Gasol admitted afterwards. \u201cThe beginning put us in a real bad spot and we couldn\u2019t get a grip of the game early on, and I take full responsibility for that.\u201d\nAsked specifically if he would consider swapping his two centres and start Serge Ibaka in Game 3, Nurse was non-committal, though he wouldn\u2019t rule it out.\nGasol has had a rough start to this series. Through two games, he\u2019s shooting an abysmal 3-for-20 from the field. Defensively, he struggled to contain Brook Lopez in the opener \u2013 the Bucks centre went off for 29 points and 11 rebounds \u2013 and he didn\u2019t provide much resistance at the rim in Game 2.\nMeanwhile, the more mobile Ibaka would seem to matchup better against this fast-paced, sharpshooting Milwaukee team. He\u2019s had success against the Bucks in the past, averaging 22.3 points in four regular season meetings and 14.8 points over his 10-year career \u2013 more than he\u2019s scored against any other team. He\u2019s also been an X-factor for the Raptors this postseason \u2013 they\u2019re 6-0 when he scores in double figures and 2-6 when he doesn\u2019t.\nEven with all that in mind, it\u2019s hard to fault Nurse for sticking with Gasol early in this series. Despite his modest numbers (7.9 points, 5.9 rebounds and 2.9 assists on 40 per cent shooting), Gasol has had a strong postseason. Like his teammate Kyle Lowry, Gasol\u2019s impact doesn\u2019t always show up on the box score. Without his defence, neutralizing a couple of all-star centres in Nikola Vucevic and Joel Embiid, the Raptors may not have made it to the Conference Finals.\nIt\u2019s a tougher decision than some may realize, but it\u2019s one Nurse has spent all season preparing to make.\nAfter being eliminated by LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in each of the last three seasons, twice in second-round sweeps, the Raptors have had to look back in order to move forward.\nWhat did they do wrong? What should they have done differently? What can they do to ensure that it doesn\u2019t happen again? These are the questions that team president Masai Ujiri has pondered and Nurse \u2013 the former assistant who was hired to replace his old boss \u2013 has been tasked with trying to answer.\nThis is a new year and a different team, but there are lessons to be taken from past failures. One of the first that Nurse spoke about publicly after being promoted in June was the way in which the team had managed its rotation in preparation for the playoffs.\nVery early in the 2017-18 season, Dwane Casey settled on a rigid 10-man rotation, which featured two units that played a lot of minutes together, and why not? The starters were really good and their young second unit, which became known as the \u201cBench Mob\u201d, was the very best in the NBA.\nHowever, when they ran into the Cavs \u2013 a team that played small and shot a ton of threes \u2013 in the playoffs their rotation was exposed and they were forced to adjust on the fly.\nThat series started with a missed opportunity in Game 1 and an embarrassing blowout loss in Game 2. Sound familiar?\nIn Game 3, Casey made a lineup change \u2013 starting Fred VanVleet in place of the struggling Ibaka \u2013 but was it the right one? Jonas Valanciunas was still matched up with Kevin Love, who had been playing centre for Cleveland. It wasn\u2019t until the Raptors were on the brink of elimination in Game 4 that they finally brought JV off the bench and started Ibaka at the five.\nAt that point, it didn\u2019t seem to matter what rotation tweaks they made. The problem was they weren\u2019t prepared to improvise. If it looked like some guys had never played together before, it\u2019s probably because they hadn\u2019t.\nSo, from the moment Nurse got the job his mantra has been experimentation. The Raptors used 22 different starting lineups during the regular season \u2013 10 more than they used the year before \u2013 in part because injuries and Kawhi Leonard\u2019s frequent rest nights forced their hand, but mostly because Nurse felt it was important to tinker and remain flexible. He wanted each of his players to feel comfortable on the floor at all times, regardless of who they were out there with.\nThat was the thinking behind the platoon that saw Ibaka share the starting centre gig with Valanciunas and then with Gasol following the mid-season trade with Memphis.\nAfter starting 550 straight regular season games, Ibaka came off the bench 23 times this year, including 10 of his final 11 contests as Gasol transitioned into the starting role on a more permanent basis.\nAll of the lineup shuffling was a calculated risk on Nurse\u2019s part. It meant that chemistry would be harder to build and maintain between the units and players might find it difficult to stay in rhythm without more defined roles. Perhaps we\u2019re seeing the by-product of that now, as several of those players have struggled in the playoffs, particularly the reserves.\nNow we could find out if it was worth it.\nIbaka has played 583 minutes with the other four starters (regular season and playoffs) and so the transition back to his former role should be seamless. Gasol has also logged plenty of time with VanVleet and the rest of the subs, so a move to the bench wouldn\u2019t be that much of an adjustment, if Nurse decides to go that route.\nIn terms of other lineup changes, he may also be considering swapping the slumping Danny Green for Norman Powell, who had 14 points off the bench in Game 3 and played a pivotal role in Toronto\u2019s first-round series win over Milwaukee in 2017.\nAs bleak as things may seem coming off Friday\u2019s loss, this series is not over. The Bucks did what they were supposed to do as the favoured team and took care of their home court. Now the Raptors have to do the same. A win in Game 3 gives them new life but a loss would mean certain death, that\u2019s how small the margin for error is at this stage.\nOnly seven per cent of teams that fall behind 2-0 in a best-of-seven have ever come back to win the series (20 of 302). No team has ever dug themselves out of a 3-0 hole.\nWith the season on the line it will be interesting to see which buttons Nurse pushes and whether the ones he\u2019s already pushed pay dividends.\u200b",

(Seth Perlman / AP)\nThe world's largest beverage company may be the next industry giant to jump into the cannabis drinks business.\nCoca-Cola Co. says it's monitoring the nascent industry and is interested in drinks infused with CBD -- the non-psychoactive ingredient in marijuana that treats pain but doesn't get you high. The Atlanta-based soft drinks maker is in talks with Canadian marijuana producer Aurora Cannabis Inc. to develop the beverages, according to a report from BNN Bloomberg Television.\nAdvertisement\n\"We are closely watching the growth of non-psychoactive CBD as an ingredient in functional wellness beverages around the world,\" Coca-Cola spokesman Kent Landers said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg News. \"The space is evolving quickly. No decisions have been made at this time.\" Landers declined to comment on Aurora.\nPot stocks Tilray Inc., Cronos Group and Canopy Growth gained in pre-market trading Monday in response to Coca-Cola's interest. Tilray jumped 6.8 percent, adding to its 40 percent gain last week; Cronos rose 3.1 percent and Canopy's U.S. shares climbed 2.9 percent.\nAdvertisement\nCoke's possible foray into the marijuana sector comes as beverage makers are trying to add cannabis as a trendy ingredient while their traditional businesses slow. Last month, Corona beer brewer Constellation Brands Inc. announced it will spend $3.8 billion to increase its stake in Canopy Growth Corp., the Canadian marijuana producer with a value that exceeds C$13 billion ($10 billion).\nMolson Coors Brewing Co. is starting a joint venture with Quebec's Hydropothecary Corp. to develop cannabis drinks in Canada. Diageo, maker of Guinness beer, is holding discussions with at least three Canadian cannabis producers about a possible deal, BNN Bloomberg reported last month. Heineken's Lagunitas craft-brewing label has launched a brand specializing in non-alcoholic drinks infused with THC, marijuana's active ingredient.\nCoca-Cola has already been diversifying as consumption of soda continues to decline. The company, with its iconic brands ranging from Coke and Sprite to Powerade, announced it will acquire the Costa Coffee chain for $5.1 billion in August, and has expanded into other products including juice, tea and mineral water over the past decade.\nThe discussions with Aurora are focused on CBD-infused drinks to ease inflammation, pain and cramping, according to the BNN Bloomberg report. CBD, or cannabidiol, is the chemical in the pot plant often used for medicinal purposes, and doesn't produce the high that comes from THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol. There are no guarantees of any deal between Aurora and Coca-Cola, according to the report.\nHeather MacGregor, a spokeswoman for Aurora, said in an emailed statement that the cannabis producer has expressed specific interest in the infused-beverage space, and intends to enter that market, BNN Bloomberg's David George-Cosh reported.\nWhile marijuana remains illegal at the national level in the U.S., there is growing acceptance of the use of CBD derived from marijuana to treat illnesses ranging from chronic pain to anxiety and epilepsy. The first-ever medical treatment derived from a marijuana plant will hit the U.S. market soon, after regulators in June gave an epilepsy treatment by GW Pharmaceuticals the green light.\nAurora is Canada's third-largest pot company, with a market value of C$8.7 billion. The Edmonton, Alberta-based company has soared along with other pot stocks in Canada as the country gears up to become the first Group of Seven nation to legalize cannabis on Oct. 17.

The fire appears to have be accidental, but remains under investigation, according to a report in the Glens Falls Post-Star. Customers were in the tap room at the time, but no one was hurt, the Post-Star reported.\nThe brewery, owned by the father-son team of Bert and Christian Weber, posted this note on Facebook Monday night:\n\u201cEarlier this evening, a fire broke out at our brewery and taproom in South Glens Falls. While this is a very difficult time, we are grateful everyone got out safely. We appreciate the efforts of our local first responders and thank each of you for your thoughts and support. An additional update will be provided at the appropriate time.\u201d\nThat was almost immediately followed by offers of help from the tight-knit Upstate New York craft brewing community.\n\u201cThoughts are with you. Gonna pull the brew community together and lend a hand to you guys,\" wrote Kurt Borchardt, co-owner of Artisanal Brew Works in Saratoga Springs.\n\u201cBinghamton Brewing Co. is here to support in any way we can. We are so sorry for your loss and grateful everyone is ok,\u201d wrote the Binghamton brewery\u2019s co-owner, Kristen Lyons.\nWhile it\u2019s too early to tell exactly what help Common Roots might need, the breweries are ready, said Paul Leone, director of the New York State Brewers Association.\n\u201cThis just happened last night, and my inbox is already full with messages of \u2018What can we do?\u2019 'What do they need?\u201d Leone said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to rally the brewers -- they were rallied already.\u201d\nHelp could come in the form of equipment, brewing space or even having fellow brewers make some Common Roots styles to keep them in circulation while the Webers rebuild. Brewers could also offer proceeds from the sale of beers to benefit Common Roots.\nThere is precedent for that: When Superstorm Sandy battered the Barrier Brewing Co. on Long Island in 2012, Brewery Ommegang near Cooperstown made a beer called Barrier Relief as a fundraiser for the rebuilding effort.\nMore recently, brewers across the country, including a dozen or so in Upstate New York, joined with Sierra Nevada Brewing of Chico, Calif. to make version of a beer called Resilience. Proceeds from the sale of those beers aided victims of last year\u2019s northern California forest fires, one of which threatened the Sierra Nevada brewery.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been talk of a Resilience-type effort, but we have nothing solid yet,\u201d Leone said.\nIn its five years, Common Roots has made a name for itself with a range of beers, from pale ales, IPAs, and double IPAs to coffee stouts, sours and barrel-aged brews.\nThe fire broke out not long after Christian Weber had started a new batch, the Post-Star reported. The brewery is insured, the report said.\nThe brewery had also just launched an expansion project, hoping to \u201cadd more taproom and retail space, a private bar, an outdoor deck, and a kitchen,\u201d according to a recent Common Roots Facebook post.

    "https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/12/17563896/microsoft-whiteboard-app-windows-10-ios-web": "Microsoft is launching its collaborative Whiteboard app on Windows 10 today, and promising versions for iOS and the web soon. The app has been in preview for Windows 10 for the past seven months, and it\u2019s now being made widely available on PCs alongside a new version for the web and iOS devices. Whiteboard lets users make notes on a virtual whiteboard that can be shared and edited with others in real time across devices.\nAnyone can download the app and begin collaborating with other users. If you sign into the app with an Office 365 work or school account then you can also collaborate with multiple people within that organization. Whiteboard supports inking on Windows 10 so styluses like the Surface Pen can be used for collaborative inking, geometry recognition, table conversion, and automatic table shading. Whiteboard users have been using the app to write out process flows, create tables collaboratively, and brainstorm presentations.\nWhile an iOS app is debuting soon, the Whiteboard team is also working on an Android version for the future. It\u2019s not clear exactly when that will be available, but the web version of Whiteboard will work on Android mobile devices in the mean time. Microsoft hasn\u2019t restricted its Whiteboard app to any particular browser either, and all major browsers are supported.\nThere\u2019s no technical limitation on how many people can collaborate on Whiteboard, but Microsoft is strangely limiting the web and iOS versions to an Office 365 commercial account at the moment. Whiteboard participants don\u2019t need to use a stylus to draw or annotate, keyboard input and touchscreens are also supported so all modern devices will be able to make use of the app. Microsoft is also planning to integrate Whiteboard into its Microsoft Teams chat app, and bring the app to its Surface Hub device.\nWhiteboard is based on Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Intentional Software last year, and the software maker has been working to integrate this software into Microsoft\u2019s products. Intentional Software was founded by Charles Simonyi, who was a former chief software architect at Microsoft. Simonyi left Microsoft in 2002 after helping create Office apps like Excel and Word.",
    "https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18513309/avengers-endgame-spoiler-free-review-marvel-cinematic-universe-iron-man-thor-captain-america-phase-4": "Spoiler notice: this review expressly doesn\u2019t spoil any specific plot points in Avengers: Endgame whatsoever, but does discuss general themes, ideas, and cast members.\nIt\u2019s been just over a decade since Marvel Studios launched its flagship franchise of interconnected comics-inspired movies with 2008\u2019s Iron Man, and even now it\u2019s difficult to begin to evaluate how much that franchise has changed the face of filmmaking. After 10 years, 21 films, nearly a dozen television shows, countless tie-in comics and games and merchandising options and viral videos, and billions upon billions of dollars in earnings, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has become the Holy Grail that every major studio is questing after, usually with little success. The MCU films have set off a mania for interconnected multi-platform franchises and multi-film arcs, not to mention a still-growing tide of superhero stories in every possible medium.\nBut while Marvel has expressly laid out a number of formulas that its competitors have struggled to imitate \u2014 from its highly specific mix of action and fast-paced snippy humor to its frequent, unapologetic visual and narrative nods to the most obsessive fans in its midst \u2014 it\u2019s also beginning to break those formulas. Spider-Man: Homecoming followed up on the international hero-on-hero warfare of Captain America: Civil War with a personal little neighborhood story that dialed the MCU stakes way back and reset expectations for the franchise. Thor: Ragnarok placed its story in the hands of Taika Waititi, a comedian with a distinctively deadpan sensibility, and introduced indie-style emotional improv to the superhero world. Avengers: Infinity War let the heroes lose, and lose big \u2014 even killing off many of the series\u2019 flagship characters at the end.\nPhoto: Film Frame / Marvel Studios\nBut nothing so far has broken the Marvel formula quite like Avengers: Endgame, which follows Infinity War by diving deep into the previous film\u2019s feeling of emotional loss and helplessness, exploring it at length, and then expanding into something that isn\u2019t so much a Marvel story as a series of calculated payoffs for a decade of Marvel stories.\nHero movies have a longstanding bad habit of faking a character\u2019s tragic death for a few seconds of pathos, then immediately taking it back \u2014 and Marvel\u2019s parent company, Disney, has a particularly bad track record with this trope, going all the way back to 1937. Avengers: Endgame puts the brakes on that by finally taking its own sweet time in exploring how heroes might deal with grief, loss, survivors\u2019 guilt, and the pervasive feeling of failure. The crowded cast means that no one character gets much time to fully examine their feelings, but directors Anthony and Joe Russo and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely make it clear that they\u2019re all thinking about individual people who died in Infinity War, and how to navigate a future without them.\nEndgame spends so much time on these thoughts that it winds up turning into an extended superhero take on Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u2019s excellently weird HBO series The Leftovers, about survivors navigating the wake of a mass worldwide disappearance. Endgame\u2019s tone is mostly deeply somber \u2014 even when the protagonists formulate a plan and start taking steps, they\u2019re grim and angry. The most purely comic-relief characters barely get out a few dark, barbed chuckle lines along the way, and many of the action scenes are brief and abortive. On top of that, the narrative ends up splitting to put a wide selection of characters in different places, chasing goals in ways that don\u2019t always convey urgency. At times, Endgame feels like Inception, with the mind-bending sense of a dozen equally important things happening all at once, but without the sense of unity or a cohesive, well-modulated buildup. Endgame gives its characters a lot of downtime to consider the ramifications of their moves, or to explore personal sidetracks that drop the momentum off to nothing.\nPhoto: Film Frame / Marvel Studios\nAll of which leaves Endgame feeling like an odd mess of a movie. If a film with this exact structure and pacing (and 181-minute run time) was made with original characters, critics would eviscerate it as self-indulgent, sloppy, and incoherent. Viewers would probably meet it with the kind of cult love and mass indifference that greeted similarly ambitious, effects-packed, narratively sprawling projects like Jupiter Ascending or Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets.\nBut these aren\u2019t original characters. They\u2019re beloved heroes who\u2019ve been built up in the public eye for so long that anytime they cover new emotional ground, it can feel more significant than whatever the latest magical McGuffin or fight for the future of the universe might elicit. Generally, when a superhero glowers and grimaces and can\u2019t express any emotion but fear and anger, it feels frustratingly familiar. But when endlessly striving Captain America (Chris Evans) or smart-mouthing Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) or swaggering god of thunder Thor (Chris Hemsworth) are reduced to that state, it feels like the world really has shifted in a meaningful way.\nAnd Endgame\u2019s filmmakers pack their story with payoffs for the longest-term fans, reminding them how well they know these characters\u2019 existing emotional arcs and deep-seated insecurities, and drawing those ideas out at length. Tony Stark\u2019s constant war between arrogance and his heavy sense of responsibility, Thor\u2019s buried insecurities, Steve Rogers\u2019 deep-down ache for everything he lost when he was jolted out of his own time \u2014 they all get some screen time, ramped up to new heights by the latest crisis.\nPhoto: Film Frame / Marvel Studios\nInevitably, not everyone gets an examination worth having, or a storyline that lives up to the 10-year buildup. Sidekick characters like Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) get plenty of screentime without doing anything new. Primary characters like Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) are key to the action in ways that become actively frustrating as they don\u2019t develop past their familiar baselines. And the most-changed character, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), goes through yet another significant evolution in his Hulk history, without ever contending with what the latest changes mean in this story, or could mean in future stories.\nAnd yet. The shadow of Infinity War is a stark, dark one, and Endgame only has one real job: to move the MCU forward past Infinity War\u2019s climactic horror. Every moment of Endgame feels like it was made with that in mind \u2014 to convey the audience past the shock and into grief, anger, hope, and tremendous excitement. It was made for the kind of fans that will collectively gasp in shock at every significant twist (and there are a few huge ones), then cheer in relief at every climactic blow for the future integrity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\nWith that in mind, Endgame doesn\u2019t just play as a wild tangle of interacting plotlines and self-indulgent personal rabbit holes for these characters. It plays as an endless series of payoffs, in some cases for long arcs \u2014 like Tony Stark\u2019s standoffish, dismissive relationship with Spider-Man (Tom Holland), whom he starts the film mourning in a passionate, personal way \u2014 and in other cases, for the tiniest of passing jokes from other MCU movies. The entire film is constructed of callbacks, references, reminders, and reminiscences. It\u2019s full of catharsis for its characters and its audience, sometimes through immense battles, sometimes through elaborate low-key conversations between characters, and sometimes through tiny, abrupt moments. It feels like an anniversary project, a look back through the ol\u2019 MCU scrapbook, and a big collective group hug after Infinity War.\nPhoto: Film Frame / Marvel Studios\nEndgame was never designed to stand on its own as a single well-crafted movie, and it was never designed to follow the MCU formula. It was designed to cap a decade of buildup around a single gigantic story. (Even if Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige has confirmed that Endgame isn\u2019t the final film in this arc \u2014 the upcoming Spider-Man: Far from Home is.) In that sense, it\u2019s certainly a triumph: it\u2019s ambitious, towering, and above all, daring in its difference.",

Considerable chunks of the pitch had been churned up by three consecutive NFL games - the most recent just 24 hours before such a showpiece match - and the bits that weren't still clearly boasted the markings of another sport.\nThankfully for those that run the league, City remain worth tuning in for on any occasion.\nDavid and Bernardo Silva give the impression they could pass their way out of a locked room and their exquisite close control has rarely looked better as Guardiola's side moved the ball with a silky smoothness that defied their surroundings.\nEven if the opening goal owed much to Ederson's thumping kick forward, more important was Raheem Sterling's guile to beat England teammate Kieran Trippier before providing the perfect cut-back for Riyad Mahrez - who is increasingly getting into the right moments for his new club.\nTottenham gave City more problems than most teams have this season, repeatedly exploiting space behind Benjamin Mendy on a night that brought the Frenchman's defensive deficiencies to the surface.\nFernandinho and the rest of the defence showed why this team have now gone six league games without conceding though, stretching every bit of strength and skill going to keep the ball away from their net.\nThe second half deteriorated into a game the pitch deserved.

If there\u2019s a way to help the team right now, you do, if it makes sense.\u201d\nMcPhee watched that game against the Jets with interest, as it was the latest example of the Knights not measuring up with the league\u2019s top teams.\nThe Knights are 10-18-2 against the other 15 clubs that currently occupy a playoff spot, including a 5-9 mark against the Western Conference.\nAfter losing 10 of their past 13 games, the Knights have fallen out of the race for the Pacific Division title and suddenly are looking over their shoulder at fourth-place Arizona, which is six points back with a game in hand.\n\u201cThe bottom line is, we control our own destiny,\u201d coach Gerard Gallant said. \u201cWe have to win hockey games.

Winnipeg hasn\u2019t been shy about its pursuit of the 26-year-old Manitoba native, while Boston, Calgary and Nashville also have been linked.\nThe Flyers\u2019 asking price for Simmonds is expected to include a first-round pick, though it remains to be seen whether the Knights \u2014 or teams like Tampa Bay, Boston, Toronto, Calgary or Winnipeg \u2014 are willing to give up that.\nThe Knights own three third-round picks and three fifth-round picks in 2019 along with three second-round picks in 2020.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the depth that other organizations have,\u201d McPhee said. \u201cOur picks and prospects mean a lot more to us than other clubs do because they\u2019ve probably got a lot more. We\u2019ve done a very, very good job of stockpiling good, young players and picks, but we\u2019re two years old.\u201d\nMcPhee traditionally is active at the deadline and could look at defensemen such as Ottawa\u2019s Cody Ceci or Shayne Gostisbehere of Philadelphia.\nUp front, Andre Burakovsky of Washington is a former McPhee draft pick, while Florida\u2019s Jonathan Huberdeau, who played for Gallant in juniors, would be a splashy acquisition.\nMore Golden Knights: Follow at reviewjournal.com/ GoldenKnights and @ HockeyinVegas on Twitter.\nContact David Schoen at dschoen@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-5203.

Once the board is set and the pieces are moving, this matchup may come down to the wire for the second week in a row.\nOn a more optimistic note, the Packers have scored 23-plus points in 10 of the last 12 home games vs. Minnesota. And one of the games they didn\u2019t was last year\u2019s shutout with Brett Hundley under center.\nFOX will broadcast the game. Kevin Burkhardt (play-by-play) and Charles Davis (analyst) will call the game from the booth with Pam Oliver reporting from the sidelines.\nThe game can be heard over Milwaukee\u2019s WTMJ (620 AM) and the Packers Radio Network, which is made up of 50 stations in five states. Wayne Larrivee (play-by-play) and Larry McCarren (analyst) will call the game.

See the list as released by the White House.\nThat list includes Don Willett, a former Texas Supreme Court justice who has mocked the president on Twitter, and Sen.

Boulevards have transformed into seas of bodies gathered together in hope and high expectation of repeat success. Everybody is singing, dancing, cheering. There is talk of Kylian Mbappe winning the Golden Shoe.\nYet the elixir of footie, as in 1998, when France first lifted the World Cup trophy, was only a ceasefire in the culture wars, a beautiful dream soon vanish, a momentary pause, false dawn. For the nation\u2019s deep-seated issues over race and multiculturalism were allowed to fester and governments continued to treat the underclass as a problem best forgotten. The opening scenes, occurring as they do 20 years on from the initial victory, are as ironic as they are tragic. For what has changed? Nothing.\nLes Mis\u00e9rables\u2019 set-up is a bit like Antoine Fuqua\u2019s 2001 Oscar-winner Training Day. A cop, here relocated from the sticks, is assigned to a jaded unit working the rougher parts of the capital and has his eyes opened to how a badge and status imbues loose cannons with a fascistic sense of entitlement and power over the lives of others. Things escalate quickly enough and the unit\u2019s brazen, self-defeating approach to policing is akin to throwing petrol on a roaring fire.\nAlthough the handling of certain plot dynamics on occasion isn\u2019t as strong as its potent aesthetic finesse, Ly mounts a thriller operating as a savage indictment of social policies and underhand police tactics and ass-covering corruption. Those sworn to serve and protect are allowed free rein to unnerve and harass. Paid to be our public servants, they swan about as our masters. \u201cI do what I want,\u201d the white leader of the unit tells a fifteen-year-old French-Arab girl he\u2019s menaced in broad daylight.\nRiveting, pitched somewhere between The Battle of Algiers and Do the Right Thing, Ly\u2019s immersive use of slum locations, compelling scenario (it\u2019s based on a real-life incident) and brooding atmosphere make for an impressive debut film and vital reminder how lack of social justice generates unending and unnecessary misery. Coming as it does in the days of the Yellow Vests protests and President Macron\u2019s tin-eared blundering while in office, Les Mis\u00e9rables is bound to cause a stir.\nThe 72nd Cannes Film Festival takes place from 14-25 May.\nMartyn Conterio | @Cinemartyn",

Another car exited the highway, skidded off the side of the ramp, turned straight toward Jimmy\u2019s door\u2014straight toward the man who is now the third-highest-paid player in the National Football League.\u201d\nGet Point After Delivering exclusive analysis and commentary on the Patriots and the NFL right to your inbox, on weekdays during the season. Enter Email Sign Up\nLuckily, Garoppolo\u2019s driver veered off the road, avoiding a collision.\nWhat was Garoppolo doing during his car ride? According to Lee, he was studying the new playbook he had to learn.\nRelated: Why are the Patriots suddenly not everyone\u2019s darlings of the NFL?\nHis response to the Brady-Belichick rumors almost pose more questions than they answer.\nWhen asked about the rumored drama between Bill Belichick and Tom Brady, and how it might have led to the 49ers trade, Garoppolo offered an ambiguous quote.\n\u201cParts of it were true, parts of it I knew weren\u2019t true, parts I didn\u2019t know if they were true or not,\u201d Garoppolo said. \u201cI appreciated that Coach Belichick put me in the best situation\u2014you hear those horror stories about guys finding out from \u2026 Twitter.\u201d\nHe was 6\u20192\u2033 in the sixth grade, but didn\u2019t play quarterback until high school.\nAdvertisement\nGaroppolo\u2019s background in football was explained to a new level, including that he didn\u2019t start playing the sport until sixth grade. Even then, he began as a tight end and linebacker.\nRemarkably, he was 6\u20192\u2033 in elementary school, and he became a running back. His coach would often call a halfback passing play, which was \u201calways\u201d a touchdown. Yet according to the story, Garoppolo turned down offers to switch positions to become a quarterback out of respect for his friend who lived down the street (and was the current starter).\nFinally, in 2008 as a junior in high school, Garoppolo transitioned to quarterback. Who did he model his game after? Tom Brady.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even like I was a Patriots fan,\u201d Garoppolo said, \u201cbut seeing him do that, it was flawless. I was like, \u2018OK, that\u2019s how I should throw.\u2019\u201d\nRelated: Bill Belichick texted Jimmy Garoppolo after each of his starts with the 49ers\nHis college coach was stunned he was at Eastern Illinois.\nAfter being recruited and put on scholarship almost blind by Eastern Illinois (\u201cthere was barely enough data or game tape to put together a firm scouting report\u201d), Garoppolo wowed his new coach, Dino Babers.\n\u201cThis guy shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Babers reportedly told a staffer. And after the staffer confused his meaning, Babers clarified.\n\u201cNo, he shouldn\u2019t be here, as in, he shouldn\u2019t be at I-AA,\u201d Babers explained. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole bunch of coaches who should be fired for missing this guy. He\u2019s really, really good.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWillie McGinest gave him a draft day jolt.\nGaroppolo registered his college roommates as his brothers in order to get them into the NFL draft in 2014. They all shared the same hotel room, with Garoppolo giving his bed to friends, instead sleeping on the couch.\nAnd, according to the profile, it led to a moment with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell:\n\u201cOn Day 1 of the draft, Roger Goodell approached the Garoppolo table in the green room. Juice Williams, who is 6\u20197\u201d, black and clearly not Italian, looked up at the commissioner. \u201cEight brothers, huh?\u201d Goodell said with a laugh. (The NFL disputes this.)\u201d\nOn the second day of the draft, Garoppolo had an impromptu run-in with former Patriot Willie McGinest. McGinest told him, \u201cI\u2019ve got a feeling I\u2019m about to call your name here in a bit.\u201d\nGaroppolo thought he was joking, but McGinest proved prophetic 40 minutes later. The first phone call with Belichick went by without incident despite the volume in the room.\n\u201cEveryone was making noises, and I couldn\u2019t hear half the things,\u201d Garoppolo told Lee. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter what was being said. I made sure to say, \u2018Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.\u2019\u201d\nHe shadowed Brady without \u201cruffling feathers.\u201d\nHaving met Brady briefly during a pre-draft visit, Garoppolo came to understood the subtlety of learning from the NFL legend without getting in his way.\n\u201cI was going to watch and literally absorb everything I could from him without being an annoyance,\u201d said Garoppolo. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to ask a ton of questions. I didn\u2019t want to ruffle any feathers. You have to play the politics a little bit.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nRelated: What\u2019s the state of the Patriots offensive line ahead of training camp?\n\u201cWe would push each other and we got two Super Bowls out of it.\u201d\nCompeting day-in and day-out with Brady was perfect for Garoppolo, who explained their post-practice \u201cbucket game\u201d (when quarterbacks try to drop passes into a bucket) was especially intense.\n\u201cThere would be days where one of us would win and you wouldn\u2019t talk to the other for a little while,\u201d Garoppolo noted. \u201cWe\u2019d be fine the next day, but it was one of the best things for me. We would push each other and we got two Super Bowls out of it.\u201d\n\u201cThe competitiveness between the two of us was very similar,\u201d Garoppolo said. \u201cIf I\u2019m playing my best friend in one-on-one basketball, if we are both into it, by the end, we are going to hate each other. That\u2019s how it is. All the good competitors have that. We got along, but there were always times where we wanted to kill each other. It was a healthy, competitive relationship.\u201d\nLove advice from Brady?\nThis was one of the few front on which Garoppolo revealed basically nothing.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that,\u201d he told Lee. \u201cThat\u2019s top-secret stuff.\u201d\nHe\u2019s always had the mindset to believe he could beat anyone, even Brady.\nAdvertisement\nGaroppolo acknowledged that he\u2019s not lacking in confidence, and never has. When he first arrived in New England, he admitted thinking he could win the starting job over Brady, even if that was impossible:\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had that mindset. I knew that [Brady] was better than me in my first day in the NFL. Naturally, you\u2019re the rookie and he\u2019s the veteran, but you have to have that mindset, that you want to be the starter.\n\u201cEven when I was a little kid, my brothers, whenever we would play, I would literally always think I was going to win. I wouldn\u2019t, but I would always think that. It\u2019s like when I go to New England, when I first got there, I thought in my head, \u201cI\u2019m better than this dude.\u201d\nGaroppolo tempered the quote by saying he would \u201cnever speak that\u201d quote aloud. In his own words, it\u2019s about his mindset.\n\u201cI\u2019m not stupid,\u201d Garoppolo said. \u201cYou have to pick your battles, but I had belief in myself that I could do certain things, and it\u2019s always worked out pretty well. It will always be in me, that drive that comes from my dad telling me that someone is always working harder, that I\u2019m always in last place and I need to catch up to someone else.\u201d\nThe 49ers wanted a quarterback who wouldn\u2019t wait for Brady to retire.\nWhile San Francisco\u2019s football hierarchy wanted Garoppolo well before the 2017 NFL trade deadline, they were really sold on him after he forced the Patriots\u2019 hand.\n\u201cI know New England wanted to keep him there and keep him on ice before Tom eventually retired \u2026 but what was exciting for me was that New England knew he wasn\u2019t going to re-sign there,\u201d Shanahan explained to Lee. \u201cHe wanted to start and he wanted to play. He forced their hand. \u2026 It would\u2019ve been cool to play for Belichick and do that stuff and be in that system once Brady retires, but he didn\u2019t want to wait. That\u2019s the guy you want.\u201d",

Lytton\u2019s gash was deep, almost to the bone, one witness said.\nLytton is a professor of physiology and pharmacology at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn. He graduated from Harvard University in 1978.\n\u201cOur thoughts and well wishes are with him and his family as he recuperates,\u201d said Dawn Walker, a spokeswoman for SUNY Downstate Medical Center. Lytton\u2019s family requested privacy.\nOn Thursday, beachgoers recounted the horrifying incident. Marc Charbonneau, 56, of Montreal said he had seen Lytton swimming by himself at high tide, in water that was \u201cway over his head.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nLytton was swimming near seals, said Charbonneau and a friend, Kevin Cox, 69, of North Carolina. Lytton was beyond the seals when he swam past the two men, parallel to the shore, Cox said.\nSeals off the shore near Longnook Beach in Truro. (David L Ryan/Globe Staff\nAnother witness, who declined to give his name, said he and his family had just pulled into the parking lot when a woman ran up a steep bluff and yelled, \u201cDoes anybody have a cellphone? There\u2019s been a shark attack.\u201d\nSoon after, the man saw about 10 people carrying Lytton from the water. Lytton was wrapped in a towel, and when it slipped off the man saw \u201ca pattern of red marks\u201d on Lytton\u2019s leg, he said.\nJoanne Fredericks, Charbonneau\u2019s wife, said she tried to comfort a distraught woman after the attack.\n\u201cShe came up crying,\u201d Fredericks said. \u201cShe thought maybe he lost a limb or something.\u201d\nBrian Carlstrom, superintendent of the Cape Cod National Seashore, said officials were working with the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy to determine what kind of shark bit Lytton.\nKenneth Dutra was on duty at Longnook Beach. Warnings are posted about sharks and the possible danger of swimming. David L. Ryan/Globe Staff\nGreg Skomal, a senior biologist with the state Division of Marine Fisheries, said it was a \u201cvery good probability\u201d that the bite came from a great white shark, citing the species\u2019 strong presence off the Massachusetts coast this time of year.\nYet Skomal said he couldn\u2019t make a definitive determination without examining Lytton\u2019s wound and learning more about the encounter.\nJames Sulikowski, a shark researcher at the University of New England, said the bite may have come from a sandbar shark, a species that also lives off the Massachusetts coast and is much smaller. Sandbar sharks are about 4 to 5 feet long, while great whites measure about 8 feet.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cPuncture wounds are typical of a shark that size,\u201d he said.\nSulikowski said shark bites are extremely rare, even as the great white population appears to be increasing. Describing the incident as an \u201cattack\u201d was not accurate, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like the shark was waiting to come out of the darkness and bite this person,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a mistaken-identity interaction, more than anything else. It\u2019s nothing to get alarmed about.\u201d\nThe International Shark Attack File, a database of known attacks, cites only 26 fatal shark attacks off US waters in the last 50 years. The last fatal attack in Massachusetts is thought to have occurred in 1936, when a 16-year-old was seized by a 6-foot shark in Mattapoisett and later died from his wounds.\nThe Atlantic White Shark Conservancy tagged a shark. David L Ryan/Globe Staff\nBut encounters are happening more as shark populations grow, said Gavin Naylor, an evolutionary biologist who directs the Florida Program for Shark Research.\nThe increase is driven by two factors \u2014 conservation policies that protect great white sharks and seals, a favorite source of food that has become far more abundant, he said.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is this ecosystem come back to what it used to be maybe 50 years ago,\u201d Naylor said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the reinstatement of a natural balance.\u201d\nThat increase is a positive for the environment, but creates a natural tension \u201cbetween people wanting to be in the water and these predators,\u201d Naylor said.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cPeople need to be acutely aware that they share the water with these creatures,\u201d he said.\nDespite the attack, Steve Roderick, the president of the Truro Chamber of Commerce, said he doesn\u2019t anticipate a drop in visitors. When a man was bitten by a shark in Truro in 2012, the town saw no drop in tourism, he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of beaches in Truro. We have a lot of waterfront; there\u2019s a lot of places that you can go,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it would hopefully be a little ripple but not a long-term effect.\u201d\nThe Cape Cod National Seashore promotes shark safety tips, which include never swimming alone or close to seals, Carlstrom said.\nOn Thursday, there were seven shark sightings from Truro to the tip of the Cape, according to the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy.\nIn Truro, Laurie DeCiantis, 47, said she and her family have visited the beach every summer for the past 20 years. DeCiantis knew something was wrong when she saw at least five helicopters buzzing overhead on Wednesday afternoon.\nThere have been far more shark sightings in recent years, she said. But it wasn\u2019t until she talked to an official at the beach parking lot that she learned about the severity of the incident.\n\u201cOver the years we\u2019ve seen activity. We\u2019ve seen fins,\u201d she said. \u201cBut over the last few summers it\u2019s gotten much more prevalent.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nA beachgoer stood on his head at Longnook Beach in Truro.

    "https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/12/everything-nintendo-announced-at-e3-2018/": "Nintendo came out with the big guns for its pre-recorded E3 conference this morning, delivering updates on a couple of veteran franchises while also bringing some new titles to its Switch console.\nWe didn\u2019t get a ton of big surprises, but what Nintendo showed off was certainly exciting to a lot of fans. The bulk of the presentation was (as expected) devoted to the intimate minutiae of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, which is arriving at the end of the year and will bring the biggest cast to the game ever, with some new characters arriving alongside the entire cast of the series\u2019 previous iterations.\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate, Super Mario Party and Fortnite were probably the biggest highlights, but let\u2019s take a look at everything they talked about.\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nOne of the crazier parts of this announcement included the fact that Nintendo has made a redesigned GameCube controller, which will be compatible with the game and will be supporting your old GameCube controller somehow as well, presumably with a dongle.\nAvailable December 7, 2018.\nSuper Mario Party\nAlongside the new gameplay content, Super Mario Party is going to integrate some weird multi-Switch gameplay that will allow users to play together across multiple Switch consoles and merge their screens together.\nAvailable October 5, 2018.\nFortnite\nAvailable now for free download.\nOther stuff\nIn addition to the big-gun trifecta of game announcements, Nintendo also shed some light on other titles coming to the system, which has realistically had a pretty tiny game library since launch.\nFire Emblem Three Houses\nComing spring 2019.\nDRAGON BALL FighterZ\nComing 2019.\nXenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna \u2013 The Golden Country\nNew update available September 14 for Expansion Pass members.\nOther titles announced during the Nintendo Direct included Daemon X Machina, Overcooked! 2, Killer Queen Black, Hollow Knight and Octopath Traveler. In terms of the new Pok\u00e9mon titles, Let\u2019s Go, Pikachu! and Let\u2019s Go, Eevee!, they will be available November 16 and people will be able to buy a $99.99 combo that includes the Pok\u00e9 Ball Plus controller, as well.\nSo that\u2019s it; no Metroid Prime news, no Animal Crossing for Switch, no other big teases \u2014 but there\u2019s certainly a good chunk of titles to keep Switch owners excited for a while.

    "https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/10/dysons-got-a-500-air-powered-curling-iron/": "Moving air \u2014 that\u2019s the through line across most of Dyson\u2019s products. The vacuums, fans, hand dryers, hair driers \u2014 at their heart, they all the do the same thing. Same goes for the new Dyson Airwrap, which has figured out a way to leverage vacuum power into hair curling.\nHere\u2019s how Dyson describes it,\nAt the heart of this story comes a radical idea: harness Dyson\u2019s digital motor to create a phenomenon known as the Coanda effect. The Coanda effect occurs when a high-speed jet of air flows across a surface and, due to differences in pressure, the air flow attaches itself to the surface. Taking advantage of this principle, Dyson\u2019s team of aerodynamicists created a way to style hair using only air combined with heat.\nThat\u2019s engineering talk for a device that shoots air through a half dozen holes, wrapping hair around the cylinder. Then, like a standard curling iron, it uses heat like a standard curling iron \u2014 though this one is much less hot than cheaper models, potentially saving your hair (and skin) in the process.\nAll of which is to say it\u2019s not this:\nDyson says it spent six years researching/testing the product, which seems to be on-par with the company\u2019s high engineering standards. No surprise then that the Airwrap isn\u2019t cheap. The kit starts at $500, with the \u201ccomplete\u201d version running $550 for multiple hair types.",

They have not only beaten and drawn with Liverpool over the last few days, it's how they have competed that's impressed me.\n\"They've had the confidence to play out against one of the best pressing teams in Europe, a radical change from the more pragmatic Antonio Conte.\"\nTelegraph\n\"This was Chelsea\u2019s biggest game of the season so far, an occasion Abramovich would normally be keen to take his seat for, particularly with his latest managerial appointment looking good and Hazard on fire,\"writes Matt Law for the Telegraph .\n\"It is exactly what Abramovich has always wanted, a team able and willing to imprint their style on any opposition and his very own Lionel Messi who can turn a game with a stroke of genius.\n\"He would have been gutted about Daniel Sturridge\u2019s spectacular late equaliser for Liverpool, but he would also be hugely encouraged by another good display.\n\"Abramovich has had plenty of successful teams and only time will tell whether or not head coach Maurizio Sarri can deliver trophies. But the Russian has dreamed of Chelsea being able to win in style and they might finally be on course to do that, just as he is no longer showing up to see it.\n\"Abramovich has never before been an absentee foreign owner, making it his business to keep a personal eye on what is happening on the pitch.\"\n(Image: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)\nThe Independent\n\"For all the late fireworks, Chelsea\u2019s draw with Liverpool was a game that did not have too much tangible effect on the early title race \u2013 but did maybe reveal a lot about one of the factors that will fire it,\" writes Miguel Delaney for the Independent .\n\"Mohamed Salah may have ended last season as the undisputed \u2013 and double \u2013 player of the season, but his display and wider form means he no longer looks like the best player in the division. That, at least while Belgian teammate Kevin De Bruyne is injured, is indisputably Eden Hazard.\n\"He only continued his sensational opening to the campaign, by so exquisitely completing the move for the opening goal in Saturday\u2019s draw. It was just more convincing proof of a star on form, lifting his side to his higher levels.\n\"As their main goal threat now, Hazard just gives Chelsea a proper end product that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be there; a penetration to passing moves that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be there.\n\"That goal was such compelling evidence. Having surged through after an exquisite combinative passing off the type Maurizio Sarri idealises, Hazard still just put the ball in pretty much the only place he could.\n\"He seems to be thriving, and moving up another level, in the way the manager seems to be encouraging his creativity.\"\n(Image: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)\nThe Guardian\n\"Twenty minutes after the final whistle, with the sky above the stands fading to a deep pinky-blue, the Liverpool fans were still singing. This was an excellent game with elements of cheer for both teams in a 1-1 draw \u2013 and indeed for Manchester City, too, who saw both their main title rivals gouge a piece out of each other at Stamford Bridge,\" writes Barney Ronay in the Guardian .\n\"For Liverpool\u2019s supporters, there was a little extra feeling in taking a well-deserved point through Daniel Sturridge\u2019s brilliant late equaliser. There are two elements to this. Most obviously, Liverpool drew at Chelsea despite Mo Salah seeming once again to have his gears misaligned, haring around the Stamford Bridge pitch like a soap box cart with a wonky wheel.\nWhat is certain is that Salah does look below his best level. This game had been billed, rightly or wrongly, as a head-to-head in the creative areas, a measure of Eden Hazard\u2019s current sublime form against the memory of Salah\u2019s brilliance last season.\n\"If this always seemed like a simplification, then Hazard was brilliant here all the same, confirming his status as the outstanding player in the league right now. Under Maurizio Sarri, Hazard has been asked to engage only the forward gears. This must be the right way to use him. Just give us the good stuff, as much as you\u2019ve got.\n\"Hazard it was who opened the scoring, spinning in the centre circle and firing the thrusters away from the left side of the Liverpool defence, feet battering the turf at extraordinary speed, like a drum roll before the finish.\n\"Mateo Kovacic found him with an expert through pass. As Alisson came out, Hazard found the far corner of the net with a lovely clipped finish.\n(Image: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images)\nKeep up to date with the latest news, features and exclusives from football.london via the free football.london app for iPhone and Android .\nAvailable to download from the App Store and Google Play .",

As one of the Dallas Fuel\u2019s DPS players, EFFECT has been instrumental in the Fuel\u2019s performance since the Inaugural Season and participated in some League-defining plays for the team.\nToday, @EFFECT announced his retirement from professional Overwatch on his Facebook account. He has given our organization and fans thrilling memories, insane plays, multiple championships and has been a true pleasure to watch. We wish you the best and brightest future @EFFECT. \u2014 Mike Rufail (@hastr0) April 6, 2019\nEFFECT has been one of the most transparent professional Overwatch players, being open and honest about his struggles \u2013 both professionally and emotionally. EFFECT\u2019s Facebook post, originally written in Korean, details his struggles with mental health issues and cites this as his reason for retiring from professional play. It should be noted that EFFECT\u2019s Facebook post contains potentially triggering material for community members who struggle with depression or mental health issues.\nEFFECT\u2019s decision to take time away from professional play is not the first time the player has emphasized his self-care and well-being. After the Stage Three of the Inaugural Season, EFFECT returned to South Korea, citing mental health issues as his reason for his break. In a tweet that has since been deleted, EFFECT mentioned the need for rest and that he needed to deal with his mental health as the reason for his temporary break from competitive play. The Dallas Fuel took heed from EFFECT\u2019s decision to go home during Stage Four of the Inaugural Season and had sports psychologist Don Kalkstein work remotely with the Fuel players to help them overcome the mental exhaustion that playing competitively can cause.\nThere\u2019s no question that professional players are at a high risk for burnout, especially players like EFFECT who are very transparent about their lives. After the Inaugural Season ended, EFFECT came out publicly as bisexual. He mentioned the effect this had on his mental health and the scrutiny he faced being bisexual in a country that opposed gay rights. It\u2019s a lot of pressure for anyone to endure, and it was smart of EFFECT to make the right choice for himself.\nBoth the Dallas Fuel and community are sad to see EFFECT retire, but it might not be the last we\u2019ll see of EFFECT. He mentioned that he wants to continue to create YouTube videos and stream online to support himself. And if you\u2019re sad that you might not see EFFECT wear the iconic blue colors of the Dallas Fuel, you might get to see them again as Mike \u201chastr0\u201d Rufail said that they would love to support EFFECT has a streamer.\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with mental health issues, you are not alone.

It\u2019s a whole new movie,\u201d Gadot said when asked about the next movie, which is slated to premiere on November 1, 2019.\u201cThe bar is very, very high, but our aspirations are even higher,\u201d Gadot added, according to reports. \u201cWe just give it everything that we have, really hoping that what we bring, you guys will love.\u201dFans who lined up for hours to attend the special Warner Bros. panel were also treated to video footage from the upcoming sequel, despite the fact that filming is still ongoing.According to reports, the clip showed Gadot as Wonder Woman lassoing two guys with guns inside a mall food court, while a group of young girls watch in awe.But fans did not get any answers to a gnawing question: How does Steve Trevor (Pine) show up in the sequel if he died at the end of the first film?\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that,\u201d Pine said, as Jenkins chimed in: \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m super excited for everybody to see. It\u2019s a very important part of our movie.\u201dBut Jenkins said that Wonder Woman \u2013 Diana Prince \u2013 was still the heart and soul of the film.\u201cThe thing that I love the most about Wonder Woman, which remains true, is that I feel that she is us, more than most superheroes,\u201d the director said according to reports. \u201cPeople find themselves in Wonder Woman, in all genders, sizes and abilities... she is every one of us.

    "https://thelandryhat.com/2018/08/10/dallas-cowboys-earned-star-niners/": "Although the Dallas Cowboys lost their preseason opener to the San Francisco 49ers, here are some of the players who earned their Star Thursday night.\nFinally, after a long offseason, the Dallas Cowboys are playing actual football again. And against a team other than themselves! The Cowboys kicked off their preseason on Thursday night, playing the San Francisco 49ers at Levi\u2019s Stadium.\nAlthough Dallas would end up losing the exhibition 24-21, there were several Cowboys who played well in the contest. Here is my list of players whom I believed earned their beloved Star on Thursday night.\nMichael Gallup, Wide Receiver\nNo single player captured the hearts and minds of Cowboys fans more than rookie wide receiver Michael Gallup did against the Niners. The 22-year old caught only one pass on the night. But it was a 30-yard touchdown catch on the opening series of the game with a majority of the starters playing on both sides.\nGallup would later get wide open on another play, but backup quarterback Cooper Rush underthrew the ball for an incompletion. That play only helped to reinforce the idea that this rookie receiver could make a big contribution for Dallas this season. All aboard! The Gallup-hype train is leaving the station.\nLance Lenoir, Wide Receiver\nThe other wide receiver that exited the Cowboys first preseason game rated higher than when he entered is Lance Lenoir. The second-year wideout has played well in training camp and continued that level of play into the team\u2019s first preseason game.\nKnown for making flashy catches in camp, Lenoir made a beautiful two-yard touchdown catch in the back of the end zone off a play action pass from Rush. The toe-tapping reception was reminiscent of the Santonio Holmes catch that won Super Bowl XLIII for the Pittsburgh Steelers back in 2009.\nSuddenly, Lenior appears to be the favorite to win a spot on the active roster. Now the question is which Cowboys receiver is suddenly expendable?",

United at Audi Field. It\u2019s the second of two scheduled MLS matches between the clubs this season and the third overall.\nThe Lions will face United with their third coach in as many meetings between the two Eastern Conference sides this season, as James O\u2019Connor gets his first look at D.C. after Jason Kreis and Bobby Murphy led Orlando into battle in the first two installments.\nHistory\nThe Lions are 4-3-1 against D.C. in the all-time league series since the club joined MLS and 4-3-2 in all competitions. Orlando is 1-2-0 on the road against United but this will be the first ever meeting at Audi Field. The two teams met on opening day and the Lions posted a dramatic late 1-1 draw on Stefano Pinho\u2019s 93rd-minute goal. Orlando went down to 10 men 41 minutes into the match when PC was sent off. The teams met in U.S. Open Cup action on June 20 at the Maryland SoccerPlex and again drew 1-1, but the Lions advanced to the quarterfinals thanks to a 4-2 penalty shootout win. Luciano Acosta put the hosts ahead but Justin Meram equalized on a rainy night and that was it for the scoring until the shootout.\nOrlando swept the two league meetings in 2017, starting with a 2-0 win over United at Orlando City Stadium on May 31. Cyle Larin and Giles Barnes provided the offense to help the Lions snap what was then a six-game winless skid. City also snapped an eight-game skid (0-6-2) when the teams met again on Sept. 9, when the Lions had two men sent off but still won, 2-1. Larin and Barnes did the damage again, so United fans will not mind seeing that neither player is on the 2018 OCSC roster. Kofi Opare gave his team a lifeline in the 89th minute but D.C. couldn\u2019t find an equalizer.\nThe teams split two lopsided games in 2016, with each team winning at home. United grabbed a 4-1 win at RFK Stadium and the Lions avenged that loss with a 4-2 win to close their tenure at Camping World Stadium.\nThe Black & Red won the first meeting back on April 3, 2015, with Luis Silva scoring on a 91st-minute free kick, breaking Orlando hearts, 1-0. On May 13 of that inaugural season, Orlando led 1-0 on Larin\u2019s goal, but D.C. scored twice to win, 2-1. Orlando finally got on the board in the series on June 14 that year with Kak\u00e1 scoring off the rebound of his own missed penalty to provide the Lions\u2019 1-0 winning margin.\nMatch Overview\nD.C. will look a bit different this time around. Former England, Everton, and Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney has joined D.C. and brought a bit of swagger to the side. Playing atop one of the league\u2019s most talented attacking midfields \u2014 which includes Yamil Asad, U.S. international Paul Arriola, and Luciano Acosta, Rooney will provide finishing up top for D.C. and he\u2019s already opened his United account.\nThe Lions will be tasked with stopping the powerful attacking force with a back line held together with spit and duct tape. Jonathan Spector (hamstring) and Lamine San\u00e9 (knee) remain out with injuries and PC has been playing left back the last few matches for O\u2019Connor\u2019s squad. Orlando City has conceded seven times in the last two matches.\nThings don\u2019t look much better up top for Orlando. Dom Dwyer should be good to go, but Sacha Kljestan (ankle) didn\u2019t train all week after being chopped down from behind by Brandon Bye in the 3-3 draw vs. New England last Saturday. In addition, Yoshimar Yot\u00fan will miss this match and the next after being sent off in stoppage time of that same game. The midfield could be a trio of Josu\u00e9 Colm\u00e1n between Mohamed El-Munir (left) and Chris Mueller (right), but I wouldn\u2019t rule out a more defensive-minded option in the lineup in the form of Tony Rocha, Will Johnson, or even Dillon Powers. After all, O\u2019Connor was not happy about all the goals conceded the last few weeks.\nI would expect some kind of fluid 4-2-3-1 system, which is what we\u2019ve mainly been seeing from the Lions the last several games. Even if it\u2019s announced as such, it might play more like a 4-3-2-1 at times depending on who is in the attacking midfield and how O\u2019Connor tactically approaches the game.\nOrlando City will have to lock down the midfield and keep D.C.\u2019s attackers from finding Rooney. The defense will need to keep Rooney well marked and watch for give-and-go play between the veteran striker and United\u2019s talented midfielders.\nIn addition to the aforementioned to Spector, San\u00e9, and Kljestan, Uri Rosell (hamstring) has been day-to-day, but he returned to training this week and should be available for selection.

    "https://www.tvfanatic.com/2019/02/shameless-season-9-episode-10-review-los-diablos/": "Fiona's life as she knows it is over.\nShameless Season 9 Episode 10 started with my favorite Gallagher realizing the error of her ways, striving for change, but in a much worse position by the final scene.\nLet's start with that dark opening scene. It was dumb of Fiona to leave the money out while the cafe was still open. There's no getting away from that.\nI thought the money would be gone when she returned, but that would have been too predictable. The three men were menacing, and there's no telling what they would have done if the other staff member did not show up to save the day.\nThe truth is, Fiona's been getting so drunk that she no longer knows fact from fiction. That scenario at Patsy's gave her the nudge in the right direction she needed.\nWelcome to the South Side, bitch. Fiona Permalink: Welcome to the South Side, bitch.\nPermalink: Welcome to the South Side, bitch.\nShe was finally taking accountability for her actions. It gave me hope that Fiona was getting a happy ending what with Emmy Rossum's departure looming.\nMargo was right to fire her. She's gotten erratic. She's gotten drunk on the job; she's been ridiculing customers, yelling at staff members, and even accusing people of sexual misconduct.\nIt's surprising that it took Margo a month of complaints to make a decision. Then again, the business guru knows Fiona has helped the diner turn in a profit like never before.\nMargo may not have picked up the phone, but that's probably because she was giving Fiona time to get it together. It's just a shame that Fiona took too long to sort herself out.\nFiona: I've had a rough few months, but I've turned a corner.\nMargo: People who say they've turned a corner, they haven't turned a corner. Permalink: People who say they've turned a corner, they haven't turned a corner.\nPermalink: People who say they've turned a corner, they haven't turned a corner.\nThrowing the vodka out was a great start. I thought for sure Frank would have been able to sniff that all the way from the Hobo Loco Hunger Games.\nRelated: Get Showtime via Prime Video Channels for Award-Winning Original Series, Hit Movies, Sports & More!\nFiona rallying up the entire South Side to go to the new neighbor's door was the moment I realized there's no hope for Fiona, and she's going to find herself back in prison.\nIf Fiona felt so strongly that the woman called the cops on Liam because of his skin color, then she should have had a chat with the woman to find out what the real issue was.\nBringing an army to the woman's door, jumping over her fence and punching the woman so hard that she fell to the ground was not the right way to go about things.\nWaitress: Yo, wakey wakey.\nFiona: Get the fuck away from me.\nPermalink: Get the fuck away from me.\nPermalink: Get the fuck away from me.\nThere's no rooting for Fiona anymore. It hurts me to write that because she's my favorite character, but she's several zip codes away from the line she crossed back on Shameless Season 4 which almost resulted in Liam's death.\nI don't doubt for one minute that Fiona would rough someone up if they mess with her family, but that punch was built on the rage she was holding inside after being fired.\nKnowing that Fiona is reverting to her old ways, if the woman presses charges and this goes to trial, Fiona could be headed to jail. That would be a terrible goodbye for such a great character.\nShameless has an issue saying goodbye to its characters, so prison seems to be the place they're sent to in case the actors change course and decide to come back (I'm looking at you, Cameron Monaghan).\nHopefully, the powers that be craft a more meaningful conclusion for Fiona than being locked up. This journey we've traveled with her would be a waste if it ended with prison.\nRelated: Showtime at TCA: Shameless Renewed, The L Word Revived & More!\nAs for the Hobo Loco Hunger Games, I didn't find them funny. The series loves to poke fun at poverty-stricken families, but there has got to be laws against exploiting them in such a manner.\nHobo Loco put profit over ethics, and I couldn't shake that during all of the scenes with Frank fighting to the death to keep himself in the competition.\nFrank: That's the way we're going to play this thing?\nMickey: All's fair in love and hobo wars. Permalink: All's fair in love and hobo wars.\nPermalink: All's fair in love and hobo wars.\nThe only semi-enjoyable part of it all was Mickey wanting to join forces with Frank to share the winnings. In hindsight, Frank should have accepted that offer.\nIngrid was at home while all this was playing out, and I couldn't help but laugh as she tried to dole out therapy over the phone while Fiona was poking fun at her.\nFiona was right. It was bizarre to have someone who was not of sound mind doling out therapy over the phone -- in the Gallagher house no less.\nWith Katey Sagal signed to appear on an ABC pilot, it sounds like her character is not sticking around, so it wouldn't surprise me if she decides to move back in with her ex-husband and have the children with him.\nThey're looking for someone with no purpose in life. I've finally found my calling. Frank Permalink: They're looking for someone with no purpose in life. I've finally found my calling.\nPermalink: They're looking for someone with no purpose in life. I've finally found my calling.\nIngrid desperately wanted to believe that Frank was the man for her, but she's slowly starting to realize that he's only a short-term lover who will fleece her for every dollar she has.\nI'm just waiting for the scene in which it all comes out that Carl is the father to the children. That will likely be something Frank screams when Ingrid inevitably packs up shop to leave him behind.\nThen there's Tami. I wanted to hate her because of the way she ridiculed Lip. She was so self-absorbed initially that it seemed there was no personality there.\nRelated: Shameless Shocker: Emmy Rossum Leaving After Nine Seasons!\nThese past few episodes have shed light on her in a big way, and I'm now at the point that I want the character to have a more significant presence on the show.\nThe way she acted with Xan took Lip by surprise. It would have been perfectly natural for her to run off and leave Lip to deal with the kid.\nInstead, Tami couldn't have been more motherly. I thought Xan was gone, but it seems like her mother has run off once and for all, and I'm so here for Lip and Tami looking out for this kid.\n\"Los Diablos!\" felt like the Shameless we know and love. It's slowly getting back to the creative footing it was on a few years ago.\nOther tidbits from the episode:\nDebbie is poised to pull a robbery on Carl after Kelly complimented her ass. That's going to cause a lot of drama, but it's also going to be a fun storyline.\nSantiago is gone already! While I'm happy he's reuniting with his family, the storyline would have worked better as an arc that lasted more than a handful of episodes.\nCarl's new job was brutal. He needs to find something that won't end with him getting assaulted.\nWhat did you think of the episode?

Having everyone together in one place showed how the small town operates.\nThere was no way the shopping trip was going to result in some mother-daughter bonding. Adora knew everyone was talking about Camille being a bigshot reporter and did not want to give anyone else anything to talk about.\nWhat it confirmed was that there's no hope for them to bond. Amma was mad about the article, so I can see why she was acting out, but Adora should know not to persist with Camille.\nRelated: Get HBO via Prime Video Channels for Addictive Dramas, Hilarious Comedies & Hit Movies!\nShe knows that her daughter has never been in the best state of mind, but the argument in the clothing store was horrifying. Camille should be allowed to pick out her own garments of clothing and not be judged for it.\nThe reaction from Amma to Camille's self-harm made sense. Knowing that Camille's very existence is a struggle, Amma knew that her sister was hurting.\nIt was the first moment they actually seemed like sisters. Amma dropped the feelings she was harboring towards Camille, and there was an actual progression in their relationship.\nAs for Adora and Camille, there's no way they'll ever be able to make things right. Adora has never loved Camille, and we didn't need her to confirm as much to her face.\nHell, to the media it was like Camille did not exist all those years ago.\nMarian was front and center during every family event before her death.\nRelated: Game of Thrones: HBO Boss Narrows Down Premiere Date\nThis is a horrible thing to say, but it would make for a great \"What If?\" episode if we got to see how Adora would have reacted if Camille died instead of Marian.\nI dare say she would not be as cut up about it.\nWe got yet more insight into the character of Kirk. I thought there was something off about him on Sharp Objects Season 1 Episode 4 when Amma touched his hand.\nWe now know that Camille had a sexual encounter with Kirk several years ago. There's a popular theory doing the rounds that Camille could be Amma's mother, and it would not surprise me.\nAdora could have forced Camille to give up the rights to her daughter and even covered up her being the mother altogether. Adora is cunning and knows how to pull the wool over the people of Wind Gap.\nIt's a sound theory that could ring true, but it raises the question about who Amma's father could be. Kirk may have wanted to meet with Camille, but it looked like there were a lot of painful memories brought back when he addressed Camille.\nCould that pain be that he is Amma's father? It certainly looks that way.\nIt wouldn't be a city gathering without some fighting, and it was only a matter of time before Tom and Bob went at it. Like I've said on multiple occasions, even if a person is deemed innocent after being arrested for a crime, there's always an element of doubt that follows the person around for the rest of their life.\nDid anyone else hate Adora showing Richard the house? It was like she wanted Camille to worry about what was being said, and why would Camille not worry?\nHer past is dark, full of mischief, and most of all, horror. Poor Camille likely thought Richard was going to get the heck out of dodge upon hearing about her.\nRelated: Sharp Objects Season 1 Episode 4 Review: Ripe\nThen there's Bob. Bob is pissed at the way the investigation is going. Vickery and Richard are no closer to finding the killer than they were on Sharp Objects Season 1 Episode 1.\nThe killer is smart and does not leave any sort of evidence, meaning that they've researched the heck out of every aspect of the killing game.\nAshley not being impressed with the article was tough luck. In today's world, not everything makes the cut when articles go live. Some quotes get lost in translation to create a narrative.\nThat's the way the cookie crumbles, but at least Camille knew how to handle her.\nOne person who continues to sketch me out is Jackie. Every single time I hear \"Camille Preaker\" I roll my eyes because it means we are in for another awkward meeting.\nThe good thing about Jackie is that she and Camille have very similar outlooks on the way things are run in Wind Gap. They are against it, and Jackie strives to defy orders.\nWe need to know more about her and fast. There are just three episodes left, and we need to get answers before this series concludes for good.\nOkay, Sharp Objects Fanatics!\nWhat are your thoughts on this episode?

All sessions are now available for viewing in our on-demand library. Click here to start watching.\nBesieged by spam calls and messages, Indian smartphone users have waited years for Apple to allow a government-developed spam-fighting solution onto iPhones. Now India\u2019s government is giving Apple and its carrier partners a January 2019 deadline for compliance with a new anti-spam regulation, or else iPhones will be blocked from the country\u2019s cellular networks.\nAs India Today reports, Indian telecom regulatory agency TRAI has spent years dealing with smartphone spam complaints, going so far as to self-develop an app called Do Not Disturb (DND) to stop spammers. But while Google permitted the DND app to be downloaded from the Google Play Store starting in 2016, Apple has refused to allow it into the iOS App Store on privacy grounds, as it accesses a user\u2019s call and message records.\nNow TRAI is requiring that all Indian telecom companies enable all smartphone users in the country to install the latest version of DND, called DND 2.0, on their Android or iPhone devices. A new regulation published yesterday sets a six-month deadline for implementation, which would be Saturday, January 19, 2019, and requires telecoms to \u201cderecognize\u201d non-conforming devices from their networks at that point.\nApple looked to be moving forward on the issue over the last year, though it apparently wasn\u2019t willing to accept the Indian government\u2019s earlier demands without pushback. The Indian edition of the Huffington Post says that Apple agreed to cooperate with TRAI on building the DND app last October, but wouldn\u2019t share call and message logs.\nEvent Low-Code/No-Code Summit Join today\u2019s leading executives at the Low-Code/No-Code Summit virtually on November 9. Register for your free pass today. Register Here\nIn June, Apple debuted iOS 12 with the ability to report unwanted calls and text messages from within the Phone and Messages apps, but the feature \u2014 dubbed \u201cUnwanted Communication\u201d \u2014 doesn\u2019t appear to be active in iOS 12 betas. It may be included and exclusive to India and TRAI, but if that were the case, TRAI probably wouldn\u2019t have issued a new regulation.\nGiven Apple\u2019s public statements that it complies with the laws of every country where it does business, it\u2019s fair to assume that it will work quickly with Indian authorities to implement the spam filter and avoid the ban. Doing so might even benefit the company\u2019s iPhone business, which has reportedly stagnated over the past year due to cultural and leadership issues, despite Apple\u2019s efforts to build local factories and reduce iPhone prices within the country. Three top Apple India executives reportedly quit in the past week for reasons unknown.\nIndian customers are said to receive a daily average of between five and ten spam calls and as many messages. If Android users have access to the DND app and iPhone users do not, Apple might inadvertently be giving spammers the upper hand with its users, undermining the \u201cpremium experience\u201d generally marketed for its devices.",

Hear from executives from Service Now, Credit Karma, Stitch Fix, Appian, and more. Learn more.\nWell before any of its competitors put out a similar device, Amazon introduced the Echo Show in mid-2017, incorporating the sound and intelligence of Alexa with visuals to accompany voice responses.\nSome of the lessons learned from the first Echo Show are addressed in the second-generation device, which offers a bigger screen and improved user interface for streaming video and which made its debut during an event last month at Amazon headquarters, where nearly half a dozen new Alexa-powered devices were rolled out.\nThe Echo Show comes in charcoal and sandstone and costs $229. It goes on sale October 11.\nDisplay and design\nOne thing immediately apparent is that the switch from a 7-inch to 10-inch screen provides a richer experience, as does an increase in pixel density and an HD screen. The 10-inch screen is consistent with 10-inch offerings from the Smart Display category for Google Assistant.\nEvent Low-Code/No-Code Summit Join today\u2019s leading executives at the Low-Code/No-Code Summit virtually on November 9. Register for your free pass today. Register Here\nThe second-generation Echo Show also includes design adjustments that may seem basic at first glance but that together make for a more modern device. First, the Echo Show\u2019s two speakers have been moved behind the screen, giving the device the look of a seamless screen. (The first-generation Echo Show had speakers directly underneath the screen for a face that resembles a small television.)\nA thinner bezel means four of the eight microphones were moved to the face of the device.\nThe other major hardware change is that the Echo Show now comes with a Zigbee hub for controlling smart home devices, allowing you to control your smart home devices even when Wi-Fi goes down.\nThe new Echo Show also has a much improved user interface, which includes quiet actions \u2014 essentially, a list of your smart home devices on a screen that lets you turn things on and off with touch. Quiet actions are also available for alarms and routines and can be accessed with a swipe down from the top of the screen.\nTouch control of smart home devices is also programmed to show up each time a smart home voice command is used.\nYou will notice another big change when you turn the device on and glance at the home page. Rather than a set of bullet points for home page cards, as in the first generation, this device does away with both bullet points and arrows on the edges, which means content on the larger screen now appears to float.\nThe home screen also gets a range of new content \u2014 such as box scores for games that just ended and announcements about when your team will play next.\nThere\u2019s also more trending video from providers like USA Today, along with movie trailers and some world news.\nI hope the content comes to include local news and more ways to vary content flashed on the home screen, rather than being limited to a smattering of national and international news headlines. Trending topics can share video or a quick snippet of text on the topic.\nThis feature will get even more interesting as Amazon becomes more contextually aware and personalized to serve up intelligent query ideas.\nAlexa is learning how to suggest skills based on how relevant they are to your question \u2014 without requiring you to say the name of a skill for it to launch. This means you can say \u201cAlexa, help me book a handyman\u201d instead of \u201cAlexa, launch HomeAway.\u201d\nWhen Alexa makes recommendations, visual skills are not yet prioritized, but the Best on Screen choice sits atop the smattering of Alexa skills that appear onscreen when you say: \u201cAlexa, show me skills.\u201d\nVideo enhancements\nThe second-generation Echo Show comes with many additions to its video offerings, and that\u2019s by necessity. About two months after the first-generation Echo Show came out, it lost its ability to play YouTube videos due to a public spat about listing Nest products on Amazon\u2019s online marketplace.\nThere\u2019s the Fire TV Recast, which uses over-the-air digital signal antenna to pick up about 25 to 30 channels for live TV anywhere. Fire TV Recast will include a DVR and respond to the voice command: \u201cShow me my recordings.\u201d\nIn addition to streaming DVR, the second-generation Echo Show also comes with an improved Amazon Prime Video user interface, which allows you to sort through content by categories or get recommended titles for what to watch next. Prime Video was available on the previous Echo Show, but it only really offered you the ability to toggle between titles left to right instead of seeing a grid of several options.\nWhat you see when you come upon this Amazon Prime Video interface matters because it doesn\u2019t just change what people see when they say \u201cAlexa, show me Prime Video,\u201d it also changes what people see when they say much more generic commands, like \u201cAlexa, show me movies\u201d or \u201cAlexa, show me TV shows.\u201d\nA similar interface is used for video skills kit users, starting with Hulu and NBC, to give their content a kind of landing page. Hulu and NBC video skills were not made available by the time this review was published.\nAlongside the Hulu and NBC partnership and all the other announcements last month was news that Alexa will begin to make proactive notifications for users. Called hunches, they are currently focused on the smart home \u2014 such as offering a reminder if you forget to turn off a light when you go to bed. But hunches for TV shows or content could be amazing and really change the way people think of devices like the Echo Show.\nAnother great addition to the visual experience for Alexa is the Alexa Presentation Language (APL), which will give Alexa skills developers the opportunity to include more visual content in voice apps.\nBetter cooking instructions\nThe Echo Show and its competitors in the visual smart speaker space have always offered ways to help people cook, and the Echo Show is now better at guiding people through a recipe step by step.\nWays to close the loop on what Amazon wants to accomplish by helping people cook dinner might be offering Dash Replenishment or a quick way to add a recipe to your shopping list or Whole Foods cart.\nThose features are not available today, but I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019re far off.\nIt would also be nice to be able to add ingredients to your shopping list by pressing a single button.\nIn the hands-on review VentureBeat published last month after the Echo Show made its debut in Seattle, we suggested that you can use a new feature to add multiple items to your shopping list. While great in theory, it turns out that\u2019s not so simple in practice, as it maxes out around five or six items. It\u2019s still helpful, but it can\u2018t quickly add all the necessary items to your shopping list in one go.\nEvolving a visual interface for a hands-free experience\nBy virtue of being Amazon\u2019s chief visual offering with Alexa, the Echo Show is a sort of standard bearer for the emerging field of hands-free products that deploy AI services. The first-generation Echo Show was not really up to this title, but the second-generation Echo Show has a series of additions that make it a more thoughtful, easier to use device, with new video choices to explore.\nThis version of Echo Show appears to be the answer to lessons learned from feedback the first time around.\nShow Mode for devices like the Fire 8 or Fire 10 tablets means that the visual interface available in the Echo Show won\u2019t be totally exclusive, but with changes imposed on the second-generation Echo Show, there\u2019s a lot to enjoy and appreciate about the new device.",
    "https://venturebeat.com/business/activison-layoffs/": "Did you miss a session from GamesBeat Summit Next 2022? All sessions are now available for viewing in our on-demand library. Click here to start watching.\nActivision is planning to cut \u201cnon-development jobs\u201d because it isn\u2019t releasing enough games. This news comes via a Kotaku report that claims new Blizzard boss J. Allen Brack sent a letter to employees detailing the layoffs. GamesBeat has separately confirmed that Activision Publishing boss Rob Kotish sent a message to employees that said layoffs are coming. He did not get into specifics in that message.\nAnd confirming everything above reported above, the publisher is laying off people across Activision Publishing, Blizzard Entertainment, and King. During a conference call with investors this afternoon, Activision said it is cutting 8 percent of jobs, which is about 800 of 9,600 employees.\nThis reorganization is primarily about taking money away from non-development jobs and putting those resources into its game-creation teams.\nHere\u2019s how Brack explained the layoffs in his letter obtained by Kotaku:\n\u201cOver the last few years, many of our non-development teams expanded to support various needs. Currently staffing levels on some teams are out of proportion with our current release slate. This means we need to scale down some areas of our organization. I\u2019m sorry to share that we will be parting ways with some of our colleagues in the U.S. today. In our regional offices, we anticipate similar evaluations, subject to local requirements.\u201d\nI have reached out to Activision Blizzard for a statement, and I will update this story with any comment. But these layoffs come as the company is also reporting the results of its 2018 fiscal year.\nCutting jobs while setting records\nActivision Blizzard generated $2.38 billion in revenue, and the company was quick to point out that was an all-time record. At the same time, the company said that making more money than ever is not enough.\n\u201cWhile our financial results for 2018 were the best in our history, we didn\u2019t realize our full potential,\u201d said Kotick said in the earnings release. \u201cTo help us reach our full potential, we have made a number of important leadership changes. These changes should enable us to achieve the many opportunities our industry affords us, especially with our powerful owned franchises, our strong commercial capabilities, our direct digital connections to hundreds of millions of players, and our extraordinarily talented employees.\u201d\nWall Street expected Activision Blizzard to generate closer to $3 billion in revenues, and investors care more about that than company records. The publisher also has a dim outlook for its fiscal 2019, which it is calling a transition year. Overall, the company expects revenues to drop 13 percent year-over-year.\nSo the company is making layoffs to deal with concerns about its future.\nActivision\u2019s plan\nThe layoffs are just step one of Activison\u2019s plan to return to growth. It also plans to put more people on its top franchises to increase the rate at which it is outputting content.\n\u201cThe number of developers working on Call of Duty, CandyCrush, Overwatch, Warcraft, Hearthstone, and Diablo in aggregate will increase approximately 20 percent over the course of 2019,\u201d reads Activision\u2019s quarterly report. \u201cThe company will fund this greater investment by de-prioritizing initiatives that are not meeting expectations and reducing certain non-development and administrative-related costs across the business.\u201d\nActivision wants this increase in developers to lead to more game releases and more in-game content.\nThe rest of Activision\u2019s plan is to use its existing infrastructure to better sell games. This likely means advertising more of its games in King mobile titles and putting more releases into Battle.net. But the company leadership did not provide many details about how this will work beyond the following statements.\n\u201c[Activision will focus on] integrating our global and regional sales and go-to-market, partnerships, and sponsorships capabilities across the business,\u201d reads the company\u2019s press release. \u201c[And by] enabling better leverage talent, expertise, and scale on behalf of our business units.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know what that means, but I\u2019m sure Bobby has it under control.\nCorrection: This story originally claimed that Bobby Kotick sent a message to employees about layoffs. This was a mistake. Activision Publishing boss Rob Kotish actually sent the message. I\u2019ve corrected and apologize for the error.",

Once there, she encounters Evelyn Evernever, who gives her a sort of personality test asking her seemingly mundane questions like if she bites her nails and feels stressed. After Betty says that she doesn\u2019t consider herself to be a cold person, Evelyn shuts down the interview in a very, it must be noted, frosty manner. Her plans to inflitrate the cult herself have failed, so Betty turns to Cheryl for help.\nLooking like a high school version of Gene Hackman in The Conversation, Betty puts a bug in Cheryl\u2019s \u201ciconic\u201d spider brooch and sends her to Farm HQ to get as much info as possible \u2014 all the while listening on comically outdated technology. This plan quickly implodes, as Cheryl is slowly discovering the charm of The Farm. Betty goes to yet another one of the group\u2019s endless open house events and finds the room where the tapes in which her family members have incriminated themselves are being stored and swipes them.\nShe visits Cheryl to tell her that she no longer has to have anything to do with the Farm. But Betty doesn\u2019t get it. As it turns out, The Farm has allowed Cheryl to visit with her darling (and departed?) twin brother Jason. He is apparently alive and well at The Farm. Betty then asks her mother if she likes The Farm because they let Alice to talk to her maybe not as dead as we thought son, Charles.

Episode 2\nEpisode two of Mayans starts off with a bang, taking one tiny prisoner. Keeping the action going from last week\u2019s season premiere, the Purge inspired child soldiers of the rebel faction have an axe to grind with Miguel Galindo. Since the cartel destroyed their families and made them orphans, why not make Galindo choke on his own medicine? The rebels kidnap his son, right out of the arms of his wife, Emily (EZ\u2019s ex-girlfriend).\nLittle do they know; this type of turnabout is all too familiar for the Galindo family. In an episode that could easily have been titled \u201cthe sins of the father\u201d Sutter puts the theme of duality on the back burner and instead considers the complex and oft repetitive nature of the parent/child dynamic. Are we doomed to repeat the mistakes our parents made? How do we get trapped on this wheel, suffering the same consequences over and over again, never managing to learn our lessons the first time?\nAnd the Galinda family, for all their cold, clinical, and outright sociopathic tendencies, have suffered. Imagine Momma Galinda as a QVC shopping, church book-club version of Gemma. Wearing pastel. A terrifying image, though not nearly as terrifying as when she calmly advises her son to show no mercy and give no ground to the kidnappers. Just like his father did, years ago when Miguel\u2019s older brother was kidnapped by a rival cartel and ultimately killed. Sure, it hurts, but nothing is worse in this business than backing down.Right?",

He liked being able to take the air out of the ball in the second half with the running game.\n-- Tennessee had a good game plan for Alabama, he said. There was some confusion at times.\n-- Tua Tagovailoa could have returned after taking a big third-quarter hit. But they had already planned on using Jalen Hurts about then anyway.\n-- Saban said they had a lot of fun in the locker room.\n-- \"It was good to see Butch Jones get dunked on,\" Saban said of the Gatorade. \"He's happy and he's done a great job for us and we really appreciate the things he's done to help our program.\"\n-- The bye week comes at a great time to give time for guys who are \"nicked up.\"\n-- Saban didn't get a good look at how Deonte Brown looked at left guard. Lester Cotton sprained his ankle last week and it's been a competition there.\n--Saban liked the three three-and-outs Alabama forced to open the game. He wanted them to sustain it more. Second quarter was a problem.\n-- Josh Jacobs started at RB. Damien Harris didn't play in the first quarter for \"internal reasons,\" Saban said.\n-- On the decision to bench freshman punter Skyler DeLong: \"Nobody is entitled to a job. Everyone is in a competition. We need to help Skyler DeLong, who has a lot of talent, become a better punter. He gets a little anxious in the game and loses his technique a little bit, so we are giving him some time to cool off a little bit and see things from a little different perspective. I also thought Mike Bernier did a pretty good job as well.\"\n-- Saban kinda chuckled when asked about the fan throwing ice on him running to the locker room at halftime. \"The ice doesn't bother me at all. I would rather have someone upset when playing on the road than happy with the circumstance. That means our circumstance wouldn't be very good.\"\nSee the video above for his full postgame news conference.",

Joseph in a statement. \"The U.S. Attorney's Office, ATF, and FBI are working with state and local law enforcement and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the victims and those St. Landry Parish residents affected by these despicable acts.\"\nThe Louisiana State Fire Marshal's Office, which has led the investigation into the blazes, declined to comment on the arrest. Multiple local media outlets in Louisiana have identified the suspect as a 21-year-old man who is the son of a St. Landry Parish deputy. Authorities plan to release more information on Thursday morning.\nLocal leaders praised the arrest for bringing an end to several frightening weeks for residents as hundreds of investigators worked with federal authorities to determine who had ignited the fires.\n\"I'm very proud of the investigative effort that has lead to this arrest. I'm prayerful that we can close this horrific chapter and begin to heal,\" Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., said in a statement sent to KATC.\nWhen Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas, Louisiana, caught fire on April 4, consuming the church's interior, it was the third predominantly black church to burn down in St. Landry Parish in the span of 10 days, setting local residents on edge. On March 26, flames reduced St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre to just a few walls and piles of rubble. And on April 2, a blaze struck the Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas.\nAuthorities still have not determined a motive and have declined to tell residents whether they believe race was a factor in the crimes, according to The Advocate. On Sunday, State Fire Marshal H. \"Butch\" Browning told worshipers at Mount Pleasant that about 200 state investigators were working the case alongside officials from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the FBI.\n\"There is clearly something happening in this community,\" Browning said in a statement last week. \"That's why it's imperative that the citizens of this community be part of our effort to figure out what it is.\"\nA fourth fire on March 31 was reported more than 200 miles away at the predominantly white Vivian United Pentecostal Church in Caddo Parish, Louisiana, but authorities have not established a link to the St. Landry incidents.\nFor some, the recent fires recall a dark history of attacks and threats against black churches in the South. During Reconstruction and the civil rights movement, black churches were targeted with fires, bombings and threats.\nIn 2015, a white-supremacist gunman opened fire on a prayer group at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, killing nine black people. Nearly 200 years before, Emanuel AME's predecessor had been burned down in 1822 by Charleston's white leaders, who feared an insurrection by the city's enslaved residents.\nAn African-American man in Mississippi pleaded guilty to arson last month for setting fire to a black church in 2016. He had attempted to disguise the arson as a hate crime.\nAs authorities investigated the St. Landry fires, churches' leaders were resilient, though baffled by the attacks.\n\"My church has a lot of history,\" the Rev. Gerald Toussaint of Mount Pleasant Baptist Church told The Daily Advertiser, noting that it was more than 140 years old. \"I don't understand it. What could make a person do that to a church?\"\nGreater Union had served worshipers for more than 100 years, according to Pastor Harry Richard, whose grandfather helped found the church.\n\"He left a legacy for me and I was trying to fulfill that to the best of my ability,\" he told CBS News.\nToussaint told ABC News that \"the church is not that building. The church is the people.\"\n\u201cIf we stay together as a congregation, the church is alive and well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can rebuild the building as long as we stay together.\u201d",

    "https://www.trtworld.com/europe/activists-show-solidarity-with-muslim-girls-after-austria-hijab-ban-26721": "Insight\nRuling coalition made up of centre-right OVP and far-right FPO banned hijabs in schools, leading to an outcry by Muslims and civil rights campaigners.\nAustrian MPs on Wednesday approved a law aimed at banning the headscarf in primary schools, a measure proposed by the ruling right-wing government.\nSo as to avoid charges that the law discriminates against Muslims, the law refers to any \"ideologically or religiously influenced clothing which is associated with the covering of the head\".\nHowever, representatives of both parties of the governing coalition, the centre-right People's Party (OVP) and the far-right Freedom Party (FPO), have made it clear that the law targets headscarves worn by Muslim women.\nHere are some reactions from locals from Austria and Germany.\nTarek Bae, an independent journalist from Germany shared the following on Facebook:\n\u201cCritics of the law make comparisons with the Nazi era and in this case one should probably discuss this soberly. Without painting the devil on the wall, it is fair to say that prohibition policy is more reminiscent of the darker chapter of the last century in Europe.\nIn purely constitutional terms, therefore, prohibitions are more than just controversial among lawyers. Another explosive aspect is that it does not affect all types of headgear, which can have many political or religious reasons, but explicitly the headscarf.\u201d\nThe Syrian-born Austrian Muslim activist and writer, Tarafa Baghajati said: \"One thing remains 100 percent certain: This bill really has 0.0 percent to do with the well-being of the children.\"\nSabrina Dorn, a lecturer in Economic at the Swiss ETH Zurich, showed her solidarity with Muslim women wearing the hijab. She wrote: \"Dear [Austrian] government! Well, bite this! Banning the headscarf while allowing other religious symbols is incomprehensible and we should not tolerate the discrimination of the Muslim community in this country!\"\nShe was not the only one. Stefani Paulsen, a local Social Democrat Party member and a lecturer at the AStA University of Applied Sciences in Northern Germany Flensburg shared the following:\n\"The constant discussions about the headscarves are really unnecessary. I like to wear a headscarf and woe betide it becomes forbidden here (Germany). I'll probably emigrate.\"\nThe independent Austrian MP Martha Bissmann protested by wearing a hijab during her speech in the Austrian Parliament.\nShe later said: \"Let's not allow a wedge to be driven between us.\n\"I am decidedly against headscarf compulsion - whether in Iran or in Austrian elementary schools. Under no circumstances should a girl be forced to wear a headscarf.\"\nEmel Erdem, a linguist from Germany responded to Bissman's post:\n\"What a courageous gesture, what a courageous statement! They strengthen my belief in a peaceful coexistence - many thanks for that, all the best for their future and warm greetings from Germany!\"\nEmel Erdem, a Linguist and cultural scientist from Germany comments on the video post of the Independent Member of Austrian Parliament Martha Bissmann. (Facebook)\nAK Party MP, Mustafa Yeneroglu, who lives between Germany and Turkey expressed his disapproval:\n\"Allegedly, the headscarf ban is intended to prevent discrimination and exclusion; in fact, that is exactly what it aims to achieve. Muslims in Austria are increasingly being pushed out of society and Muslim religiosity is being criminalised. The law is aimed exclusively at Muslims. A liberal legal system does not show its qualities with ideologically motivated prohibitions, especially in dealing with minorities.\"\nMr Yeneroglu further thanked Mr Bissmann for supporting the Muslim community.\nSource: TRT World",

    "https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26669471/raptors-say-siakam-calf-doubtful-game-4": "Pascal Siakam is unaware of how his calf injury happened and is noncommittal as to whether he will play in Game 4. (1:02)\nPHILADELPHIA -- Toronto Raptors forward Pascal Siakam suffered a right calf contusion and has been listed as doubtful for Game 4 of the Raptors' NBA Eastern Conference semifinals series against the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday.\nSiakam said Saturday he hurt the calf in the Raptors' 116-95 loss at Philadelphia in Game 3 on Thursday. Asked if he thought the injury could have occurred when he tripped Joel Embiid in the fourth quarter of Game 3, Siakam said he had no recollection.\n\"I don't know exactly when it happened, but after the game I was just, like, really sore,\" Siakam said. \"I think it calmed down a little bit, then I felt worse.\"\nSiakam hasn't been able to put the leg through much physical activity since Thursday. The calf has been undergoing treatment, including ice as well as light movement therapy, he said.\nA favorite to win the NBA's Most Improved Player award, Siakam, 25, has emerged as one of the Raptors' most consistent offensive producers behind Kawhi Leonard this postseason. In eight playoff games this spring, Siakam has averaged 22.9 points, 7.4 rebounds and 2.5 assists, with an effective field goal percentage of 56.9. Siakam is also a versatile defender who has guarded all five positions for the Raptors at various junctures over the past two postseasons.\nSiakam's absence would challenge the Raptors because the team is already without reserve forward OG Anunoby, who underwent an emergency appendectomy just prior to the start of the playoffs.\n\"With the OG out, it's not the ideal position for us,\" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. \"We're a little thin there.\"\nEach scenario presents a different complication for Toronto. Nurse suggested Raptors backup guard Fred VanVleet as one option, noting the team had enjoyed success with pace and ball movement when VanVleet has played as part of a three-guard lineup. In 56 minutes on the floor with the starting backcourt and Leonard, lineups featuring VanVleet averaged 116.7 points per 100 possessions, with a net rating of plus-46.8.\nYet replacing Siakam with a perimeter player would put the Raptors at a greater size disadvantage against a Philadelphia team that features exceptional length and has hurt Toronto on the offensive glass.\n\"Size has been a problem,\" Nurse said. \"We knew coming into the series that they would have size at a lot of positions.\"\nThe Raptors could also opt to start backup big man Serge Ibaka, who has struggled in the series. Nurse also suggested as another possibility 6-foot-7 swingman Patrick McCaw, who has seen limited time on the floor since returning from a right thumb injury. Introducing McCaw into the starting lineup would enable the Raptors to preserve their current rotation, Nurse said.\n\"[Siakam is] a big part to their team, but at the end of the day, it's the playoffs,\" Sixers forward Tobias Harris said. \"We know that whatever the team presents, they have a team that has a lot of players that can do different things. So we have to be ready for whoever is on the floor and we'll be ready if he's on the floor or not.\"\nWith the Raptors trailing 2-1 in the series and now potentially without their second-most-prolific scorer, Raptors guard Kyle Lowry said it was imperative for the rest of the team to compensate in an effort to help leading scorer Leonard.\n\"Kawhi has been unbelievable in the playoffs; Pascal's been unbelievable in the playoffs,\" Lowry said Saturday. \"As other players around those guys, we need to step up in general, make some shots, be more aggressive, draw some more fouls, try to do some more things to help relieve the little bit of the scoring burden off of them.\"\nESPN's Dave McMenamin contributed to this report.",

    "https://www.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/25843158/at-royal-rumble-finn-balor-returns-spotlight-shot-brock-lesnar-universal-title-redemption": "When Finn Balor steps into the ring to challenge Brock Lesnar for the WWE Universal championship at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view Sunday night at Chase Field in Arizona, it will have been 889 days since he and Seth Rollins wrestled in the inaugural title match for that belt at SummerSlam.\nJust weeks into his run on the main roster, Balor, as \"The Demon,\" defeated Rollins and immediately put his name forward as one of this generation's brightest talents. Less than 24 hours later, he was handing over the Universal championship and stepping away from WWE after a freak shoulder injury suffered in that match seemingly took away the symbol of all he had worked toward since signing his WWE contract, and as far back as 2000, when his career began in earnest.\nBalor spent seven grueling months working his way back into shape, and over the past two years he has fought as one of WWE's workhorses to prove that injury was an outlier -- that he has what it takes to be trusted as one of the company's top stars on a day-to-day basis. All told -- counting live events, TV shows and pay-per-views -- Balor wrestled a staggering 169 times in 2018, after 124 matches wrestled in 2017.\nIn Balor's estimation, that kind of grind and claw-back has all been a fulfilling part of the journey.\n\"I feel like when I became Universal champion for the first time, I think perhaps -- all things considered, looking back -- it may have happened too soon, and I wasn't ready,\" Balor said in a recent interview with ESPN. \"And that was just ... that injury was kind of the universe's way of saying, 'Hey, Finn, time to knuckle down and work a little harder.' I thought it was very fitting for my career that it happened the way it happened. It was like another obstacle has been put in my way.\n\"I worked for six years to get out of the independent scene, the United Kingdom and then, you know, and worked for eight years in Japan to establish myself there,\" Balor continued. \"Left [there] and worked for two years to help build NXT and then here I come to WWE, and I'm a house on fire and in three weeks I've got the Universal title in my hands. I feel like it was a very fitting kind of end to that story to kind of knock me back down a peg or two, and then knock me back to the bottom of the pile and make me really fight for what I needed to.\"\nFinn Balor and Brock Lesnar are on opposite ends of the spectrum, as Balor wrestled 169 matches in 2018 while Lesnar had only 11 matches. WWE\nThere have been multiple high-profile Intercontinental championship matches, including a barnburner of a WrestleMania opening match, Raw tag-team title shots, a spot in the Money in the Bank ladder match, and Balor even made the final four of the 2018 Royal Rumble. But in the past 889 days, Balor has had but one shot at the Universal title -- an August 2018 match on Raw against Roman Reigns, which he lost.\nNow, at one of the WWE's biggest events of the year, Balor claimed a spot recently vacated by Braun Strowman opposite Lesnar, with that same Universal championship on the line. As with many of the great stories in WWE lore, the mix of storyline and real-life obstacles has led to an underdog whom fans are almost universally behind.\nFinn Balor's WWE journey was shaped during his time in NXT, during which he helped form the brand and lay the foundation for what it is today. In his own words: \"I think NXT continues to evolve. I think it's changed a lot, even since my time there. You know obviously looking back, the time I spent in NXT are some of my fondest memories in this business. Getting to work with Samoa Joe on a regular basis, Kevin Owens, Adrian Neville, Sami Zayn -- all these guys that kind of encompassed what NXT was at the time. ... I feel like since then, a lot of new fresh faces have come in and kind of made it their own. You know, the likes of Ricochet and Adam Cole coming in and really kind of upping the game. \"I think that's been the main success NXT has had, is the brand adapts to the talent that are there at the time. [At the same time,] the talent are adapting to NXT while learning the ropes at WWE, so it's a credit to the guys that are down there, to Triple H, to the coaches at the Performance Center, of what they're doing right now. I feel like if maybe I stepped into NXT right now, you know, maybe I wouldn't belong, so I'm glad I spent the time there when I did.\"\nBetween it being a modern-day David-and-Goliath battle and an opportunity for Balor to take on an opponent in Lesnar that few could have ever foreseen, the title challenger is finally exactly where he wants to be.\n\"Believe or not, I've been envisioning this match since the day I came back from injury,\" said Balor. \"Obviously being a smaller guy, I always was a huge fan of Rey Mysterio versus Big Show or the likes of Shawn Michaels versus Diesel. And this was a match that I always felt needed to happen.\n\"Obviously I didn't expect it to be for the Universal championship at Royal Rumble,\" Balor continued. \"The way the stars were aligned, and the universe, [it] has provided me with an incredible opportunity to kind of redeem myself for perhaps not fulfilling my destiny with the first Universal title run.\"\nThe Balor-Lesnar matchup isn't just special because of the difference in size or the clash of eras. Lesnar has had a grand total of 53 matches since his return in 2012.\n\"I'm also kind of fighting a very rare opponent, because I believe he only had eight matches last year, so not many people get to step in the ring with Brock these days,\" Balor said. \"Obviously that's a huge, daunting task, but something that I will relish and something that I'm looking forward to taking on toe-to-toe with 'The Beast'.\"\nWhen he walks Sunday night into Chase Field, a baseball stadium that's a larger arena than most that host WWE shows, Balor will be more at home than most on the WWE roster. In the end, though, no matter the crowd or the space in which the match is taking place, it'll be the same ring as every other WWE match he's had in his career.\nTwo-and-a-half years after his one-day, injury-shortened Universal title run, Finn Balor is primed for this opportunity. \u201cI feel like when I became Universal champion for the first time... it may have happened too soon, and I wasn't ready.\u201d WWE\n\"I honestly haven't really put much thought into what the venue's going to be like,\" he said. \"Obviously yeah, we're in Phoenix, we're in that baseball stadium. I've plenty experience in baseball stadiums from the Tokyo Dome and obviously with WrestleMania was in a huge stadium. The show we done out in Saudi [Arabia] was huge. So obviously those big environments kind of add to the mystique of the show.\n\"Hopefully the atmosphere will be electric that night, and hopefully the Balor Club will be strong and I can ride the wave of momentum.\"\nAs for the question on most people's mind, the answer is no: Balor will not be wearing the paint and the gear of \"The Demon\" or channeling that energy Sunday night. Outside of a handful of one-off appearances -- most recently against Baron Corbin at SummerSlam 2018 -- \"The Demon\" hasn't played much of a part in Balor's career since he joined Monday Night Raw.\nIn his mind, it's important that he's standing on his own strength of character and personality when he steps into the ring for one of the biggest matches of his career at the Royal Rumble.\n\"I feel like maybe I leaned on 'The Demon' too much there in the past as a crutch, and I can assure you that the man who faces Brock Lesnar at the Royal Rumble will be Finn Balor, the man,\" Balor said. \"I think a lot of people were surprised when I came out at WrestleMania not in demon paint, but I feel like I had a bigger message to spread that day -- one of equality and acceptance. Honestly, this match just kind of came about so fast that I haven't had much time to think about it. I don't have any new gear, I don't have any new looks, I don't have any new ideas right now. ... I'm sure I'll come up with something.\"",

Considering Cologne is one of Germany's oldest cities, founded in A.D. 50, it's no surprise that it still has structures dating back to Roman times.\nHowever, archaeologists didn't figure out that the structure was a library until they found mysterious holes in the walls, each measuring about 31 inches by 20 inches (80 by 50 centimeters), The Guardian reported.\nThe niches in the wall were likely \"cupboards for the scrolls,\" Dirk Schmitz, an archaeologist at the Roman-Germanic Museum in Cologne, told The Guardian. \"They are very particular to libraries \u2014 you can see the same ones in the library at Ephesus [in Turkey].\" [Photos: Centuries of History Revealed Beneath Roman Ruins]\nWhile it's anyone's guess as to how many scrolls the library once housed, it's fair to say the number would have been \"quite huge \u2014 maybe 20,000,\" Schmitz said.

If we had just found the foundations, we wouldn't have known it was a library. It was because it had walls, with the niches, that we could tell.\"\nThe ancient Romans chose a good spot for the building, he noted.\n\"It is in the middle of Cologne, in the marketplace, or forum: the public space in the city center,\" Schmitz said. \"It is built of very strong materials, and such buildings, because they are so huge, were public.\"\nDuring its heyday, the library was probably two stories tall and measured about 65 feet by 30 feet (20 by 9 meters), and an extension was added later, Cologne historic preservation official Marcus Trier told Deutsche Welle (DW), a German news outlet.

Instead, it accuses him of witness tampering, obstruction and false statements about his interactions related to WikiLeaks' release.\nBut former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Joseph diGenova blasted the tactic as \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\u201cI am appalled that the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI have permitted a vindictive use of arrest in a non-violent case with a defendant who was willing to surrender,\u201d diGenova, who has informally been an adviser to the president throughout the Russia investigation, told Fox News. \u201cThis is an abuse of power and it underscores the vindictive nature of it by the fact that CNN was alerted ahead of time.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cFor those of us who have been prosecutors and have prosecuted mob figures, drug dealers and terrorists\u2014those are the people for whom these aggressive tactics are reserved. Not a Roger Stone.\u201d\n\u201cMake no mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was designed to be vindictive and intimidating.\u201d\nDiGenova likened the FBI arrest of Stone to the bureau\u2019s early morning raid last summer of the home of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\nStone on Friday said he would plead not guilty to the charges leveled against him by the special counsel\u2019s team, and said he \u201clooks forward to being fully and completely vindicated.\u201d\n\u201cI believe this is a politically motivated investigation,\u201d Stone said Friday. \u201cThere is no circumstance whatsoever under which I will bear false witness against the president, nor will I make up lies.\u201d\nPAUL MANAFORT COULD BE CHARGED WITH MORE CRIMES DOWN THE ROAD, PROSECUTOR TELLS JUDGE\nStone served as an adviser to Trump for years before Trump ran for president. He left Trump\u2019s campaign in August 2015, but maintained regular contact with and publicly supported the Trump campaign throughout the 2016 presidential election.\nMueller\u2019s investigation, which was initially ordered to look into the 2016 election, has gone on for more than a year and half. It has expanded to probe financial crimes of Trump associates before the election, conversations Trump\u2019s national security adviser had with the Russians during the transition and whether Trump obstructed justice with his comments and actions related to the probe.\nTwenty-six Russian nationals and three Russian companies have been charged with interfering in the 2016 presidential election.

    "https://www.foxnews.com/us/rare-death-row-slaying-at-californias-san-quentin-prison": "One condemned inmate killed another Friday, the first slaying of a death row inmate in California in more than 20 years, officials said.\nJonathan Fajardo, 30, was stabbed in the chest and neck with an inmate-made weapon in a recreational yard of the cell house that holds the bulk of condemned inmates at San Quentin State Prison, said corrections department spokeswoman Terry Thornton.\nLuis Rodriguez, 34, is considered the suspect, she said. Investigators were trying to determine a motive and how he obtained or was able to make the weapon, she said.\nSuch slayings are common in California prisons but rare on death row, where the last one occurred in 1997.\n\"It's very unusual,\" said San Francisco State University associate professor Amy Smith, who studies capital punishment and the psychological impacts of death row. \"It's not supposed to happen, of course.\"\nThere is high security on death row, were every inmate is housed separately but most are allowed to congregate in small groups in the exercise yard where Fajardo was killed, Thornton said.\nAside from the higher security, Smith said that statistically, prisoners serving life sentences and \"folks who are on 'the row' generally have the lowest levels of prison violence, even though it would seem that they might do anything because they have the worst penalty. In fact, they actually have very, very low incidences of violence in prison.\"\nFajardo was awaiting execution on two counts of murder in Los Angeles County in what was considered a hate crime. He also received seven life sentences.\nHe was identified as a Latino gang member who killed a 14-year-old black girl in a racially motivated shooting. He was also condemned for the stabbing death two weeks later of a man who prosecutors said was killed because fellow gang members believed he might be cooperating with police.\nRodriguez is awaiting execution on two counts of murder, also from Los Angeles County. Local media reports identified Rodriguez as a member of another Latino gang convicted of killing two men from a rival gang. He was already suspected of another murder that resulted in a life sentence.\nNo one has been executed in California since 2006, though voters in 2016 passed an initiative that is attempting to speed up capital punishment. Far more condemned inmates on the nation's largest death row have died of natural causes or suicide than have been executed since California reinstated capital punishment in 1978.",

(Photo by Clive Rose/Getty Images)\nAfter an inconsistent season with Fulham, the young fullback/winger is looking to move on, with Tottenham the front-runners to land Ryan Sessegnon.\nHe made 35 appearances in the Premier League this season, operating all over the park for the eventually doomed London side. Sessegnon was not at fault for Fulham\u2019s demise, contributing six goals and two assists, equating to 23 percent of his club\u2019s league goals. That, though, shows just how anemic Fulham\u2019s offensive output was.\nMainly a left winger, Sessegnon also deputized heavily at left back, two positions where Spurs need reinforcement. Still 18 years old until tomorrow, May 18th, he is a highly rated, dynamic prospect, regardless of the difficulties he faced in his first Premier League campaign. With rumors of Danny Rose\u2019s possible departure rampant, Tottenham are in the market for another left back, and Sessegnon fits the bill.\nHowever, with his contract set to expire next summer, Fulham will not want to lose out on a transfer fee and will probably look to sell to a top PL club for top dollar. Transfermarkt puts his value at around $39.9m, but Spurs and Daniel Levy will look for a discounted rate. Fulham, however, have reportedly set an initial asking price of \u00a340 million.\nSpurs have had a longstanding interest in Sessegnon, with him previously turning down a move to North London. He preferred to stay with Fulham and was a key reason the west Londoners achieved promotion in 2018.\nWhile interest from Manchester United, PSG and Juventus is heating up, Tottenham are still the frontrunners.\nAccording to BBC\u2019s David Ornstein, Spurs want to complete the signing soon, and prefer him in a left back role. Ornstein reports, however, that Tottenham have not made a formal bid yet.\nSessegnon\u2019s versatility bolsters highly his market value. His best current position is farther forward, but he can easily drop deeper, much like Rose did when he first arrived from Leeds.\nHe also offers more in attack than Rose and Ben Davies, a crucial facet to the club\u2019s playing style. This season the fullbacks weren\u2019t always positive in the final third and a change is needed for improvement. Whether on the wing or in defense, Sessegnon can be a difference maker, as he was in the Championship two seasons ago.\nRyan\u2019s twin, Steven, is also plays for Fulham and there are quiet rumors he could be part of a deal to bring them both to Spurs.\nTottenham must match their accomplishments this season with an ambitious and active transfer market. Having not signed anyone since Lucas in January 2018, new players are needed to keep the squad fresh and competitive.\nCompleting this signing could push the club on this summer, bringing even more success next season.",

For a player who tends to take time to ease into the season the surgery only served to enhance those issues.\nThe larger issue was Patterson joined the OKC Thunder believing he would be the starting power forward. Aside from the injury, this idea was derailed with a last minute trade to obtain Carmelo Anthony. Seemingly, Patterson never found his true groove and while his shot improved late in the season he was relegated to the reserve unit.\nEntering his second season with the Thunder he\u2019ll once again have the opportunity to join the starters.

Provided by Basketball-Reference.com Generated 9/23/2018.\nAsked about how he will deal with the up tempo pace being discussed for this season:\n\u2018Just about trying to get the basketball from one side to the other, get the basketball up court as quickly as possible with my passing ability. Being able to find guys out on the court, not necessarily literally pushing in transition or having to shoot the ball. But just trying to find the right opportunity for a teammate to take advantage of.\nWhether it\u2019s off a drive or a quick post up or just passing it that leads an assist or another opportunity for a shot. I can understand coach wants to get more shots earlier in the shot clock or just trying to find better opportunities for us early in the shot clock and that in turn will create more looks throughout the cross of the game and give us an opportunity to put up more points.\u2019\nAsked how he feels about playing more at the four:\nPatterson says he\u2019s played both positions throughout his life. Patterson notes with the game being faster it\u2019s more important to move your feet and be able to defend. He notes the most important thing is being able to rebound, play defense and switch out on screens. In essence he\u2019s comfortable playing at the four or five.\nThoughts on Paul George\u2018s return:\nPatrick noted he had no idea whether Paul would return, but felt confident based on the camaraderie between George and Westbrook and overall team chemistry.\nDo you want to be the starting four this season?\nHe admits he would like to start, but will do whatever the team feels fits best, noting he wants to provide a positive wherever he plays (starter or reserve). When queried more on him starting given his three point shot efficiency he did speak to being able to do it, but was quick to not Jerami (Grant) did well and he suspects he improved this summer.\nThis will be Patterson\u2019s ninth season as a pro and as such makes him one of the longer tenured players on the staff. With the loss of Nick Collison there is a hole left in terms of veteran voices.\nPatterson is familiar with helping in that regard having worked closely with the youngsters in Toronto and should be able to provide quality mentoring in OKC.",

To say Sunday night\u2019s home matchup against the lowly Memphis Grizzlies was a \u201cmust win\u201d game for a team currently occupying a spot in the upper echelon of the hotly contested Western Conference would be a slightly exaggerated sentiment, however, having given up four straight, on the verge of giving up the three seed, and about to embark on a four-game road stretch, it certainly could not help but feel like it.\nThunder fans expecting to see that sense of urgency from the team to start the contest, however, would be sorely disappointed as OKC once again came out flat at home against the Grizzlies, spending the majority of the game playing catchup to a Grizzlies squad that, coming into the night, sat 14 games under .500.\nThe OKC Thunder were once again without the services of February\u2019s Western Conference Player of the Month and MVP candidate, Paul George, as he continues to nurse a strained rotator cuff. Billy Donovan again gave the starting nod to Dennis Schroder in an attempt to generate more offensive production, but going into the break, the Thunder trailed 52-46 on colder shooting than the blustery air outside Chesapeake Energy Arena.\nThrough the first half, Oklahoma City logged a lackluster 34.8 percent field goal efficiency, shooting just 25 percent from beyond the arc and 61.1 percent from the charity stripe, while allowing Memphis to shoot 51.3 percent from the floor on 44.4 percent from deep and a perfect 8-8 from the free throw line.\nThe Thunder were unable to make any substantive adjustments at halftime and saw the Grizzlies lead stretch to 13 points in the third and again in the fourth quarter off the hot hand of the newly acquired Avery Bradley.\nMemphis looked poised to steal the win on the road from the home team; however, Oklahoma City was able to string together several consecutive minutes of gritty basketball and escape with the win on the shoulders of gutsy defense and hustle plays that have characterized the OKC Thunder throughout a largely poor shooting first half of the season.\nAlthough OKC was able to walk away with the victory, several aspects of Sunday night\u2019s performance are concerning for a \u201cwin now\u201d team looking to make a deep playoff run. \u201cUgly wins\u201d are still tallied the same in the win column, but this contest was truly ugly.

Elizabeth Warren stepped boldly out into the open late Friday and called on the House to begin an impeachment process against President Donald Trump based on special counsel Robert Mueller's report.\nThe Massachusetts senator and 2020 Democratic presidential contender slammed Trump for having \"welcomed\" the help of a \"hostile\" foreign government and having obstructed the probe into an attack on an American election.\n\"To ignore a President's repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country,\" Warren tweeted. \"The severity of this misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty. That means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the President of the United States.\"\nIt was a rare moment in a crowded and unsettled primary: A seized opportunity for a candidate to cut through the campaign trail cacophony and define the terms of a debate that will rage throughout the contest.\nWith her party torn between its impulses \u2014 to avoid the potential political death spiral of a failed impeachment even though it may be popular with the energized base and to hold Trump accountable for what Democrats see as gross abuses \u2014 Warren framed pursuing House hearings as a matter of conscience.\nIn other words, she sided with that base of core party supporters, defined its cause in moral terms and hollered the message from the mountaintop.\nThat's classic Warren. And in a period when she's focused her campaign on serious policy proposals, it is a timely reminder to progressives that they like her politics, too.\nDownload the NBC News app for breaking news and politics\n\"Not doubting her sincerity here but it's also probably a very shrewd primary move to leap out front on this,\" tweeted David Axelrod, who served as a top campaign and White House adviser to President Barack Obama.\nA campaign official told NBC News Warren believed it was the right course of action after reading Mueller's report during a flight home from the campaign trail Thursday. Nevertheless, she will remain focused on her policy platform, not impeachment, the official said.\nAnd yet, calling for the removal of a president \u2014 especially when so many other Democrats are reluctant to do so (shortly before Warren issued her statement, fellow senator and 2020 hopeful Amy Klobuchar said, \"I think you've seen all the senators are very cautious about talking about this because we would be the jury if there was any kind of an action brought over from the House\") \u2014 isn't a particularly forgettable act.\nAdam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren, said the political left is outraged over the handling of the Mueller report by Attorney General William Barr and the response by the White House.\nWarren's move could help her capitalize on that energy at a time when several of her rivals have been garnering more attention \u2014 as well as bigger fundraising hauls and higher poll numbers \u2014 in the early months of the primary campaign.\n\"If you think about the oxygen that is now in the room for the entire Russia-Mueller-impeachment swirl of stuff, for weeks or months, every time someone comes out publicly and agrees that we need to begin impeachment hearings, people will remember that Elizabeth Warren is the presidential candidate that got that started,\" Green said.\nWhile Green noted Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., introduced the House resolution that would be a likely vehicle for beginning impeachment hearings, Warren's status as a significant player in the primary will likely make her announcement a major marker if the House moves forward against the president.\nAt nearly the same time as Warren spoke out, fellow progressive Bernie Sanders, the polling leader among candidates currently in the race, waved off press questions about the Mueller report in South Carolina.\nOn Thursday, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, who said during his Senate campaign last year against Ted Cruz that he would vote to impeach Trump, framed the question as one for Congress or the voters \u2014 rather than presidential candidates.\nAsked about impeachment proceedings, O'Rourke says: \"I'm gonna leave that to those members of the House who as they review those findings can make that decision. ... But ultimately at this point I believe that this is going to be decided in November 2020.\" https://t.co/kAEhVFeYdP \u2014 Patrick Svitek (@PatrickSvitek) April 18, 2019\nMayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, said he was \"pretty sure\" Trump \"deserves to be impeached\" but deferred to Congress, while former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, speaking before Warren, said it would be \"perfectly reasonable\" for lawmakers to launch impeachment proceedings. \"This president should be held accountable,\" Castro said on MSNBC.\nSen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said on MSNBC's \"All In with Chris Hayes\" on Thursday that she wants to hear what Mueller has to say about his report before passing judgment on whether impeachment proceedings should begin \u2014 similar to the position of her fellow Californian, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, perhaps the most important player in any impeachment drama.\nThe reticence of some Warren's rivals suggests her decision to walk point on the left flank of the impeachment front carries some risk, even if it's a quick path to rally support from liberals.\nIt will not only put her squarely back in Trump's field of vision, but it also will expose her to friendly political fire from Democrats who believe pursuing his ouster is the surest way to ensure his re-election.\nStill, Warren, often cited as the heir to Edward M. Kennedy as the liberal lion of the Senate, has shown that her brand can be most compelling when a healthy dose of politics is mixed in with her substance.\nThat's what happened when GOP senators cited the chamber's rules to take away Warren's speaking privileges during a 2017 debate over Trump's nomination of Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. Warren had read from a letter criticizing Sessions that had been written by Coretta Scott King in 1986.\nSince Sessions was a member of the Senate at the time of the nomination fight, Warren was told she couldn't malign him under the rules. The Senate voted to prevent her from speaking again on Sessions' nomination.\n\"She was warned. She was given an explanation,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said afterward. \"Nevertheless, she persisted.\"\nProgressives quickly adopted McConnell's disparaging phrase as a symbol for strong women. It was even condensed to \"She Persisted\" for the title of a bestselling book by Chelsea Clinton.\nIt remains to be seen whether Warren's impeachment call will give her a major boost. But there aren't many opportunities to stand out from the crowd, and she took this one without hesitation.",

Rather it is the actions of the Russian government that continue to undermine our security and that of the international community.\"\n\"We will stand up to the actions that threaten our security, and the security of our partners. It is completely unacceptable for our people to be deliberate or accidental targets, or for our streets, our parks, our towns to be dumping grounds for poison,\" he said.\nSturgess and Rowley were found unconscious at separate times in the same home on Saturday. Investigators initially suspected that they had overdosed on heroin or cocaine, but after observing their symptoms \u2500 police didn't describe them \u2500 authorities took samples for lab testing. Those tests came back positive for Novichok, Basu said.\nHe added that no one else had reported falling ill with similar symptoms.\nInvestigators are now focusing on how and where Burgess and Rowley came into contact with Novichok, Basu said.\nAs a \"precautionary measure,\" police cordoned off sites in the Amesbury and Salisbury areas that they believe the two visited just before they were sickened, Basu said.\n\"I do want to reassure the public, however, that there is no evidence that either the man or woman recently visited any of the sites that were decontaminated following the attempted murders of Sergei and Yulia Skripal,\" Basu said.\nIn Salisbury, a supported housing complex for the homeless was cordoned off 840 feet from Zizzi's, the restaurant the Skripals dined at the evening they were poisoned. So, too, was Queen Elizabeth Gardens \u2014 a park just 1,300 feet from where the Skripals were found.\nMike Wade, the director of health protection at the southwest branch of the government agency Public Health England, said in a statement Thursday that the risk to the public continued to be low.\nAmesbury is about five miles from Stonehenge, the prehistoric monument visited by more than a million people annually.\nFrancis Whittaker reported from London, and Jon Schuppe from New York.",

But a letter delivered to the White House this week by members of Congress wasn't enough to keep her with her husband, a naturalized American citizen, and their two American-born daughters.\n\"My mom is a good person and she's not a criminal,\" daughter Pamela, 16, told the media as she sobbed and covered her face.\nRep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., who was at the airport, said he told Juarez, 39, that he was sorry that she had to be deported under Trump' s \"zero tolerance\" immigration policy.\n\"We'll still be pursuing our request to the administration for her case, and we are not giving up despite this anti-immigration rhetoric,\" Soto told NBC News.\nJuarez was flying back to Mexico alone, although her youngest daughter, Estela, 9, would later be joining her, said the family's attorney, Chelsea Nowel.\n\"She is on her way to Mexico where she has no support system and knows essentially no one,\" Nowel said in a text message.\nJuarez had been living in Davenport, Florida, with her husband, Cuauhtemoc, also known as Temo, and their two daughters. Temo, who describes himself as a conservative who voted for Trump, had written his own letter to the president asking for a reprieve for his wife, reported Stars and Stripes.\nJuarez said she was escaping violence in her home country when she crossed into the United States illegally. Three years later she met and married Temo in Florida.\n\u201cI came here illegally. I\u2019m ashamed of it. I know I did something wrong,\u201d Juarez told NBC News in an interview before she was deported. \u201cI seriously thought that was the only exit out of a situation I was living in. I think that saved my life.\u201d\nTemo served in the U.S. Marine Corps and later joined the Army National Guard in Florida. He came to the U.S. from Mexico as a child and was naturalized days before he was deployed to Iraq. The couple has two daughters, ages 9 and 16, both born in the United States.\nThe office of Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., which represents the family's congressional district, earlier confirmed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement had taken Juarez's passport \u2014 foreshadowing her likely deportation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s common for ICE to take the passport to ensure the person has a valid travel document,\u201d Nowel said at the time.\n\u201cIt added an unnecessary amount of stress on Alejandra on what was already one of the worst days of her life,\u201d she added.\nSoto sent bipartisan letters on Wednesday addressed to Trump, the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security requesting a stay of removal.\nThere is an immigration policy for members of the military and their families called \u201cparole in place\u201d to \u201crecognize the important sacrifices made by U.S. Armed forces members, veterans, enlistees, and their families.\" The Citizen and Immigration Services website says they provide \u201cdiscretionary options such as parole in place or deferred action on a case-by-case basis.\u201d\nThe Juarezes received a call Tuesday from their attorney saying ICE agreed to review her most recent \u201cparole in place\u201d application. But they have rejected her previous three applications, according to Stars and Stripes.\n\u201cI love this country. This country has given me great things because we have worked hard. But the America we are living in now is getting full of hate,\u201d Juarez said.\nShe checked in regularly with immigration authorities during former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, and says she was always told she is not a criminal and has nothing to worry about.\nNow, under Trump\u2019s immigration policy, few exceptions are made for unauthorized immigrants \u2014 even in cases when a crime has not been committed.\n\u201cBefore you enlist in the military, think it twice. Before you marry an immigrant, think it twice. Think if it\u2019s really worth it for you to serve this country, because look how they treated me,\u201d Juarez previously told NBC News, through tears.\nShe had said that if she were deported Friday, she would take daughter Estela with her to Mexico while her her other daughter, Pamela, stays with her father in Florida.\n\u201cIt makes me sad, mainly because I tell my mom everything. And she always supports me \u2026 And now that I\u2019m getting older I\u2019m going to have more problems and issues that I\u2019m going to need help with and I want my mom to be there with me,\" Pamela said.\nThe parents decided to take the younger daughter to Mexico because Temo travels for work and she is too young to take care of herself.\n\"I don\u2019t really want to go to Mexico but I know I need to because I\u2019m too young and also I want to go for my mom \u2026 because I don\u2019t want her to be lonely,\u201d Estela said.\nShe went on to say what she would tell Trump if gotten the chance: \u201cI know my mom made a mistake and it was wrong, but he said he was going to deport criminals. My mom is not a criminal,\" the girl said. \"She is a military spouse and a mom of two kids.\u201d\nReporting by Carmen Sesin in Miami, Anthony Terrell in Tampa and Kissimmee and Erik Ortiz in New York; video by Jesse North.\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.",

    "https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/shrinking-shaking-wrinkling-new-study-shows-moon-racked-moonquakes-it-ncna1005626": "The moon may look serene and unchanging from a distance. But we\u2019ve known for years that it\u2019s slowly shrinking, and a surprising new study suggests the change may be triggering seismic activity.\nAs its interior continues to cool and contract \u2014 it\u2019s believed to have slimmed down by about 150 feet over the last few hundred million years \u2014 our solitary natural satellite is being rocked by moonquakes and its brittle, pockmarked crust crisscrossed by low ridges known as scarps, according to the research.\n\u201cOne of the main perceptions of the moon for the past half century is that nothing interesting (besides asteroid or comet impacts) has happened there for billions of years,\u201d Geoffrey Collins, a geologist at Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts, and a co-author of the study, told NBC News MACH in an email. \u201cI think the main takeaway is that the moon is still active today.\u201d\nThe study was published May 13 in the journal Nature Geoscience.\nEarth\u2019s moon is the fifth largest in the solar system. With a circumference of nearly 6,800 miles, it\u2019s 3.7 times smaller than our home planet. Scientists believe it was actually once part of Earth, having broken off after a collision with a Mars-sized space rock about 4.5 billion years ago. It\u2019s been cooling slowly ever since, shrinking as its interior temperature dips.\nFor the new research, scientists at the Smithsonian Institution, NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center and three other institutions took a fresh look at data from four lunar seismometers deployed by NASA astronauts during the Apollo missions of the 1960s and \u201970s.\nThe Taurus-Littrow valley is the location of the Apollo 17 landing site (asterisk). Cutting across the valley, just above the landing site, is the Lee-Lincoln fault scarp. Movement on the fault was the likely source of numerous moonquakes that triggered events in the valley. NASA/GSFC/Arizona State University/Smithsonian\nUsing an algorithm designed to find the locations of quakes from limited data, the researchers mapped 28 moonquakes that the seismometers recorded from 1969 to \u201977. Then they cross-referenced the epicenters of the quakes with super-detailed images of the moon taken by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft.\nThe scientists found that eight of the moonquakes originated near scarps, which are known to form when adjacent pieces of lunar crust along a fault line push up against each other. And six of the quakes occurred when the moon was close to apogee, the point in its orbit around Earth when it\u2019s farthest from our planet and subjected to moon-shaking stress from its gravity.\nOn the basis of these findings, the researchers concluded that the eight quakes were likely triggered by movements of the lunar crust. Their finding was supported by a computer simulation and by the LRO images, which showed fallen boulders and other signs of recent seismic activity.\nThis prominent lunar lobate thrust fault scarp is one of thousands discovered in Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera images. NASA/GSFC/Arizona State University/Smithsonian\n\u201cWhat we didn't know was how recently the young faults had been active,\u201d Thomas Watters, a senior scientist at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National Air and Space Museum in Washington, said in an email. \u201cThat was a surprise!\u201d\n\"I think it is a great start at explaining the origin of shallow moonquakes\" shown by the Apollo seismometers, Clive Neal, a moon researcher and Notre Dame engineering professor who was not involved with the study, said of the research in an email. \"We had no clue what caused these.\"\nThe findings could someday help guide the placement of future moon settlements far away from moonquake-prone areas, he added.\nBoth Neal and the researchers said more seismographs will be needed if scientists are to gain a better understanding of seismic activity on the moon, which NASA says will have human visitors again by 2024. In the meantime, Watters and his colleagues plan to compare images of the moon\u2019s surface from different years to see how the scarps evolved over time.\nAdditional reporting by David Freeman\nWant more stories about space?\nSIGN UP FOR THE MACH NEWSLETTER AND FOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM.",

Number 5\u2019s glass eye-focused quest fizzled before dodging gunfire from Hazel and Cha-Cha. A hail of bullets did little to stop 5\u2019s search, but the well-armed duo found a new location to light up: the Hargreeves mansion. Good thing all of the other Hargreeves children were there discussing Mom\u2019s role in Reginald\u2019s death. All of that action ripped down the curtain, revealing even more vulnerable bits for all involved.\nWe Need To Talk About Mom\nAllison shows the unmarked tape to Luther, revealing that Mom was at Reginald\u2019s side when he died. Luther instantly suspects that she poisoned their father, but Mom has no recollection of that night\u2019s events. She doesn\u2019t even remember Reginald dying next to her. Allison realizes that the trauma caused to Mom by being left alone in the mansion for 13 years is lost in all of the murder-mystery turmoil. This does little to deter Luther. The two leave to gather their siblings for a family meeting.\nAll the Hargreeves, sans Number 5, gather in the sitting room to view the tape. Diego immediately throws water on Luther\u2019s theory by pointing out that Mom was simply removing Reginald\u2019s monocle in the video. He further knows this because he took the monocle from her after the memorial service. The rest flip, but conversation soon turns back to Mom. Vanya points out that she was built as both a caretaker and a protector but her mechanical elements could be degrading beyond repair. Luther floats the idea of turning her off and is swiftly met with opposition from Diego as he recalls Mom\u2019s support while he battled a stutter as a child. The group take a vote with Vanya and Klaus supporting Diego while Allison sides with Luther. Allison declares the vote open until Number 5 weighs in, whenever that might be.\nObsessions & Regrets\nPersonal passion is something that Vanya has struggled with since writing her book five years ago. The tireless work of telling her family\u2019s story seems to be the last time she had any motivation. She arrives late to her orchestra rehearsal and tries to make small talk with the first chair violinist afterward. All that elicits is the same message she received from her father: Vanya doesn\u2019t possess anything special. The confrontation leads her to seek solace at Leonard\u2019s wood shop. The delighted man shows her his collection of handmade wood carvings, including one he made overnight of Vanya. He gives it to her and asks her out to dinner before revealing his knowledge of the Umbrella Academy\u2019s history.\nAllison has her own baggage to work through as it relates to her daughter. She\u2019s being forced to attend therapy in exchange for visitation rights with Claire due to her using her rumor power on her. Everything in her life came as a result of rumoring people, leading her to believe nothing in her life is genuine. Not even Luther is able to make her feel better. Elsewhere, Number 5 stakes out the Meritech doctor despite interruptions from Luther and Klaus. He watches the doc exchange a briefcase for an envelope and begins following him.\nAssault On House Hargreeves\nHazel and Cha-Cha\u2019s failure to take out Number 5 is met with pay reduction and the threat of their payoff decreasing for every additional day it takes them to complete their task. The financial kick in the butt and a tip from the donut shop waitress leads them to the doors of the Hargreeves mansion. They don their cartoon masks and open fire on Diego after exploring the house. The gunshots summon Luther and Allison to the fight while Mom sits oblivious to the attack.\nHazel is soon left alone with Vanya but Luther returns to defend her. The two big boys battle as Diego wounds Cha-Cha. Hazel takes down Luther long enough to escape before Cha-Cha drops a chandelier on him. Luther rises from the wreckage barely harmed but the twisting metal rips his clothing, revealing his Martian gorilla body. He runs away as his kin looks on in astonishment.\nWhere To Go From Here\nDiego realizes Mom\u2019s lack of reaction to the battle waged only feet from her. Her disassociation convinces Diego that she should be shut down. His hard exterior comes down momentarily as his stutter returns while saying goodbye to the only mother he ever knew. That sadness morphs into anger directed at Vanya. He labels her a liability because she isn\u2019t like them. Vanya leaves thanks to feeling unwelcome in her childhood home yet again. She winds up at Leonard\u2019s home, telling him she had nowhere else to go.\nHazel and Cha-Cha regroup at the hotel after the botched mission. They clearly have no knowledge of the Hargreeves\u2019 past as superheroes, but Hazel didn\u2019t leave empty handed. He brought Klaus along for the ride in the trunk of his car. The duo now have a hostage. Unfortunately, they took the most extra Hargreeves child of all.\nWhat do you think about The Umbrella Academy season 1 episode 3?

After Barry and Nora were taken down in the field, King shark chose to emerge once again to defeat Grodd seemingly once and for all. Elsewhere, Joe helped Iris move past her fear of Cicada after their confrontation a few weeks back.\nWith the Meta-human cure now ready for use, this episode of The Flash sees the team try to figure out how to subdue Cicada to take it. Meanwhile, Joe eases back into work with a new lead on the Meta killing villain, while Nora tries really, really hard to make sure things go to plan.\nAcid Master Strikes\nThe Episode Starts off with Nora visiting the Reverse-Flash in 2049. Thawne is upset that the timeline is changing before their eyes. Quickly loosing their window of opportunity to kill Cicada, they realize that some sort of variable is changing the timeline. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs, Nora cracks the whip on locating Cicada, but can\u2019t find any leads. Later at Jitters, Barry, Iris, and Nora try a new brew called the XS-presso, when a Meta named Acid Master emerges at the college lab. The Flash and XS arrive on the scene, but the acid Spewing Meta is able to escape. Nora realizes that the burn form his acid is similar to one in the photo from The Flash\u2019s final confrontation with Cicada.\nAt STAR Labs, Nora explains the connection to the Meta and the Newspaper photo from the future. Team Flash tries to figure out a way for Barry to talk to Cicada, and Nora urges Barry to try and find the good in Dwyer like he has in so many others. Nora and Iris talk about the plan, causing the former to get an idea of how to find Cicada. Team Flash eventually catch Acid Master, disguising Killer Frost as the Meta. Like clockwork, Cicada attacks but she\u2019s able to freeze his dagger to the wall. The Flash tries to talk to Cicada into the cure, arguing to do it for his legacy. Dwyer is able to incapacitate Barry, but Killer Frost intervenes. Killer Frost Saves Barry at the last second, but Cicada gets away with the dagger.\nFollowing A Hunch\nWith Joe back at work, he tries to catch up on the massive stack of Cicada Task Force files. Cecile offers to help, and they deduce that Dr. Vanessa Ambers might have a lead on Orlin Dwyer\u2019s niece Grace. At the hospital, Joe and Cecile question Dr. Ambres and her Meta abilities signal that she may have something to do with drugs that have gone missing. Joe is a bit uneasy with Cecile using her powers during the investigation, causing him to dismiss Ambres. Later, Joe visits Barry at his loft as he broods about his failure to get Cicada to take the cure. Joe gives a pep talk that inspires him to appeal to Cicada\u2019s human side.\nJoe eventually apologizes to Cecile about the argument earlier, offering for her to join his interrogation of Dr. Ambers. They eventually reveal the existence of the Meta cure, and she agrees to set up a meet with Dwyer. More importantly, Ambers reveals that that the wound in Grace\u2019s head caused by the satellite shard is now glowing. Joe tells to Barry about the lead, and that Dyer\u2019s niece is indeed a Meta.\nFamily Matters\nMeanwhile, Team Flash try to figure out where things went wrong with the last Cicada encounter, but Nora won\u2019t give up hope on her father yet. Nora listens to old recordings of her father\u2019s appeals, when Iris offers to go to the rooftop of jitters. Iris reveals that she wants to spend as much time with her as possible before they defeat Cicada.\nTeam Flash weighs several approaches, but eventually settle on trying to use Barry\u2019s human personality to appeal to Cicada. Nora has a heart to heart with Iris, while Barry listens on. Nora feels remorseful about not spending enough time with her parents, and Barry reveals that he\u2019s going to confront Cicada as a father. Barry\u2019s plan eventually works, convincing Dwyer to take the cure.\nCicada 2.0\nBarry brings Cicada to S.T.A.R. Labs, but the latter requests Dr. Ambres to stitch him up after the cure is administered as a condition for taking it. During the Operation, Cecille gets weird vibes from Cicada before he\u2019s put under. Ambres administers the cure and Barry gets his powers back, meaning that it worked. Sheloque and Nora celebrate their victory, but questions how she knew Acid Master would lead them to Cicada. Suddenly, the power goes out, and a female Cicada look-alike bursts through the window. Even though she\u2019s seemingly not able to dampen Team Flash\u2019s powers, Cicada 2.0 is able to shoot energy blasts and wields two daggers.\nKiller frost uses her powers to heal Dwyer up to move him, and Team Flash confronts the look-alike. She manages to take them out one by one, eventually wrecking the cortex. On the way out, she murders Dr. Ambres, taking Dwyer with her. Team flash soon realizes that this new threat might be something worse than Cicada himself. Later, Cicada 2.0 is revealed to be an adult version of Grace Dwyer.

    "https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2018/9/6/17824492/barcelona-girona-match-in-miami-date-and-time-set": "FC Barcelona will play the first ever La Liga game on foreign soil on January 26th at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami at 2:45 p.m., local time, according to a leaked document obtained by COPE. Bar\u00e7a will play against Girona, who will sacrifice a home match.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for LaLiga to build bridges and grow, transmitting the values of football and Spain all over the world,\u201d the document reads. \u201cOutside of Spain, the United States is one of the countries with the most fans of LaLiga and its clubs, where we count with millions of fans.\u201d\nIt goes on to say: \u201cSeeking to bring Spanish football and La Liga closer to these fans represents an enormous opportunity to connect with said fans and continue working for the global following of our league at international level.\u201d\nThe proposal has generated controversy among the players, coaches, and local fans. It was reported that Girona season-ticket holders would be refunded for their flights to and from Miami, to make up for the fact that they won\u2019t get a match at their stadium.\nThe effects of a transatlantic voyage, followed by a top-level match, and then another transatlantic voyage, could also be a source of troublele for the players. Also, La Liga is yet to ratify the plan with FIFA in an official capacity. The organization has previously shut down attempts to play matches in other countries.\nThere\u2019s also the pesky matter of La Liga not being shown in many TV sets around the United States.\nOn the other hand, La Liga says this is a \u201cperfect\u201d opportunity to grow the popularity of the league abroad. It certainly would be groundbreaking, as none of the top five European leagues have played a competitive league match outside of the country. Spain already tested the waters this season, holding the Spanish Supercup (which Barcelona also played) in Morocco.\nSome fans have railed against the move on social media, but some Girona fans have said that with the included flight to Miami, they are getting a good deal.\nMeanwhile, La Liga will reportedly ban political demonstrations at the match and pass out free Spanish flags. This is because both teams are from Catalonia, and it would be a logical time for those fans in favor of an independent Catalonia to make a political stand during the match.",

They dug the fort together in a snowbank, ABC6 reports.\nWhen the girls hadn\u2019t returned about an hour later, the parents went outside and found the collapsed fort, and immediately called for help. The 12-year-old suffered cardiac arrest, and was later pronounced dead. The Cook County Medical Examiner\u2019s office identified her as Esther Jung, a resident of Elk Grove Village.\nA 12-year-old girl reportedly died after the snow fort she was building with a friend collapsed. Pictured above, volunteers in Illinois walk to shovel a main street on Chicago\u2019s south side. (Photo: John J.

Charles Buczynski, she is expected to survive.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a tragic accident,\u201d Buczynski said.

Last year, a 12-year-old Canadian girl died when a snow fort collapsed on her.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics warns about hypothermia, frostbite, and injuries commonly incurred while sledding, skating, skiing, snowboarding, or snowmobiling. However, they don\u2019t provide any information on snow fort collapses.\n\u201cIt is totally understandable that kids would want to play and make forts and tunnels in the biggest pile of snow they can find, and the biggest pile of snow is probably where the trucks are dumping it,\u201d Kyran Quinlan, M.D., MPH, associate professor and section director of General Pediatrics at Rush University Children\u2019s Hospital in Chicago, told Parents.com. \u201cTo reduce the risk, municipalities could do what they can to make sure that no children are playing in the places where trucks are dumping snow that is removed. And families can try to guide children to avoid playing anywhere near where the trucks are dumping the snow.\u201d\nDespite the tragic circumstances, experts say it\u2019s no reason to discourage children from playing outside and enjoying the winter season. \u201cThe vast majority of kids who build snow forts and tunnels will be safe,\u201d he added. \u201cI hope this event is not seen as a reason to stay inside in the winter, or not dig and play in the snow.\u201d\nStory continues\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.",

The motion for an appeal argues that, because of multiple alleged errors in Cosby\u2019s criminal trial, Judge Steven O\u2019Neill was mistaken in declaring Cosby a \u201csexually violent predator,\u201d the Associated Press reports.\nCosby has been in a Pennsylvania state prison since he was sentenced Sept. 25, the same day he was classified as a sexually violent predator who must register as a sex offender for the rest of his life. He was convicted in April on three counts of aggravated indecent assault for a 2004 encounter with Andrea Constand.\nBREAKING: Bill Cosby, 81, is sentenced to three to 10 years in state prison for 2004 sexual assault. \u2014 The Associated Press (@AP) September 25, 2018\nHis lawyers, who indicated in April that they planned to appeal, now claim that the sentence is too harsh for the 81-year-old. They also assert that evidence never proved that the encounter with Constand took place in 2004. Her account that the assault happened that year \u2014 not earlier \u2014 means that it fell within Pennsylvania\u2019s 12-year statute of limitations on sexual assault when she filed suit in 2016.\nThe appeal also argues that O\u2019Neill shouldn\u2019t have considered the testimony of five other women who have accused Cosby of sexual assault. The judge told the defendant at the sentencing that he had considered \u201cvoices from the past \u2014 your past,\u201d adding that he had \u201cheard their voices loud and clear,\u201d per the AP. Cosby\u2019s lawyers believe that O\u2019Neill should have allowed only those testimonies that spoke to Cosby\u2019s guilt or innocence.\nAdding to the list of complaints, Cosby\u2019s legal team questioned the Pennsylvania law requiring a judge to find a \u201cmental abnormality\u201d \u2014 which they contend has no real meaning \u2014 in order to consider someone a \u201csexually violent predator.\u201d\nStory continues\nIt\u2019s unclear when Cosby will receive a decision on his appeal, as the Montgomery County District Attorney\u2019s Office has yet to file a response. He\u2019ll remain behind bars while he waits, though.\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:",

(Photo: Mulugeta Ayene/AP)\nFlight recorders from a doomed Ethiopian Airlines flight arrived in France for analysis Thursday as frustrated relatives of the 157 people killed stormed out of a meeting with airline officials in Addis Ababa.\nSunday's crash was the second fatal flight for a Boeing 737 Max 8 in less than six months. More than 40 countries, including the U.S., have now grounded the planes or refused to let them into their airspace.\nAfter holding out for several days, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency order grounding the planes Wednesday, saying they had new satellite data and evidence that showed the movements of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 were similar to those of Lion Air Flight 610. That flight crashed into the Java Sea off Indonesia in October, killing 189 people.\nOfficials at Lion Air have said sensors on their plane produced erroneous information on its last four flights, triggering an automatic nose-down command that the pilots were unable to overcome on its final voyage.\nEthiopian Airlines CEO Tewolde Gebremariam said its pilots had received special training on how to deal with that problem.\n\"In addition to the basic trainings given for 737 aircraft types, an additional training was given for the Max version,\" Tewolde said. \"After the Lion Air crash, questions were raised, so Boeing sent further instructions that it said pilots should know.\"\nTwo men carry suitcases containing the flight recorders from the Ethiopian jet, into the French air accident investigation authority, March 14, 2019 Le Bourget, north of Paris. (Photo: Christophe Ena/AP)\nTewolde said he is confident the investigation will reveal that the crash is not related to the safety record of Ethiopian Airlines, widely seen as the best-managed in Africa.\nFirm answers about what caused the crash could take months. The French air accident investigation authority, known by its French acronym BEA, said Thursday it will handle the analysis of the flight recorders, often referred to as a plane's black boxes, retrieved from the crash site.\nThe BEA has experience with global air crashes, and its expertise is often sought whenever an Airbus plane crashes because the manufacturer is based in France. A BEA official told The Associated Press that the recorders have already arrived in France but gave no time frame on how long the analysis could take.\nStory continues\nIn Addis Ababa, about 200 angry family members of crash victims left a briefing with Ethiopian Airlines officials, saying that the carrier has not given them adequate information. Officials said they have opened a call-in center that is open 18 hours a day to respond to questions, but family members said they are not getting the answers they need. People from 35 countries died.\nAt the crash scene in Hejere, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Addis Ababa, growing numbers of family members arrived, some wailing or beating their chests as a bulldozer navigated piles of debris.

    "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/officiating-chaos-reigns-apparent-bears-fumble-ruled-incomplete-pass-vs-eagles-234858903.html": "Officiating controversy has been a significant theme this NFL season and has continued into the playoffs with borderline calls impacting would-be scoring plays.\nBut the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 wild-card win over the Chicago Bears Sunday provided a call that required a deep dig into the NFL rule book.\nWith time running out in the first half of a 3-3 game, the Bears were driving into Eagles territory. Quarterback Mitchell Trubisky looked deep to Anthony Miller on second-and-three from the 35-yard line.\nAnthony Miller fumble ruled incomplete pass\nMiller appeared to catch the pass before being stripped by Eagles cornerback Cre\u2019Von LeBlanc on the way to the ground around the 5-yard line. It was a bang-bang play that was ruled an incomplete pass on the field and resulted in the ball rolling on the ground unrecovered before an official picked it up.\nAnthony Miller caught and fumbled a pass, but when nobody recovered it, confusion ruled on replay. (Getty)\nOfficials reviewed the play, which showed that Miller did appear to make the catch before fumbling the ball. NBC rules analyst and former NFL official Terry McAulay believed that it was a catch and fumble. But with nobody recovering the ball and the initial call being an incomplete pass, how would things be sorted out?\nComplete pass ruled incomplete due to quirky rule\nAfter reviewing the play, referee Tony Corrente appeared to confirm McAuley\u2019s analysis that it was a complete pass.\n\u201cAfter review, the ruling on the field will stand,\u201d Corrente said. \u201cThere was no clear recovery of the football. Therefore, the ball will go back. It will be third down.\u201d\nThe call confused McAuley.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a runner at this point,\u201d McAuley said of Miller. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t give him the catch. If they\u2019re going by that you have to finish it with a recovery, and you can\u2019t change it, then I guess that\u2019s the rule. Somebody could have recovered it. You\u2019ve taken away a catch from Chicago.\u201d\nOfficials got replay call correct\nBut a dive into the rulebook shows that though officials got the call wrong on the field, they made the proper replay conclusion.\nStory continues\nCorrente acknowledged that there was a catch and a fumble by noting that \u201cthere was no clear recovery.\u201d\nBut when this situation happens, and there\u2019s no recovery, the rulebook dictates that the ruling of incomplete must stand, even with the acknowledgment that there was a valid catch.\nFrom the casebook regarding incomplete passes reversed to catch/fumble, the third paragraph has the relevant information: pic.twitter.com/TQizOr7ZFP \u2014 F\u1d0f\u1d0f\u1d1b\u0299\u1d00\u029f\u029f Z\u1d07\u0299\u0280\u1d00s (@footballzebras) January 6, 2019\n\u201cIf there is no video evidence of a clear recovery or the ball going out of bounds, the ruling of incomplete stands.\u201d\nThe NFL Officiating Twitter account confirmed that was indeed the call that was made.\n\u201cIn #PHIvsCHI, the receiver controlled the ball with two feet down & took an additional step, so it was a catch. However, because he was not down by contact & there was \u2018no video evidence of a clear recovery or the ball going out of bounds\u2019, the ruling of incomplete stands.\u201d \u2013 AL pic.twitter.com/c0E00tOZwT \u2014 NFL Officiating (@NFLOfficiating) January 6, 2019\nSo, in short. The officials got the call wrong on the field. But no Eagles or Bears player jumped on the loose ball, forcing officials to rule the catch an incomplete pass.\nThe Bears would go on to kick a field goal and take a 6-3 lead before the end of the half. Had an Eagles player jumped on the loose ball, that score would have never happened. Philadelphia ended up eking out a 16-15 win when Cody Parkey\u2019s 43-yard field goal attempt bounced off the left upright and the crossbar in the game\u2019s final seconds.\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\u2022 Robinson: Keeping Jason Garrett paid off for Jerry Jones\n\u2022 Warriors-Kings combine to set history for most 3-pointers in NBA game\n\u2022 19-year-old Cal DB dies after collapsing during workout\n\u2022 Deshaun Watson\u2019s streak ends in loss to Colts",

In a world where only the terrible actions of Muslim extremists are publicized, Salah transcends that through his play to be one of the top players without sacrificing his religious beliefs.\nAs a result, Salah is using his influence as a world famous soccer player to hopefully bring change to the Middle East. In an interview with Time, Salah called on the region to change how they treat women and grant them the same rights that men are granted. It\u2019s unlikely that the words of one man will bring change to the region, but it\u2019s worth a shot.\nSalah is not the only soccer player on the Most Influential list.

This had to have been planned before Tiger\u2019s win at The Masters this Sunday, but his inclusion was perfect timing for a story about the best golfer in the world falling from grace, turning his life around, and proving a lot of doubters wrong to get back to the top of the golf world.\n[Time]",

Along with the ghosts of factories, empty billboards, and weather-beaten barns, dozens of Trump-Pence signs were hammered into the fallow farmland by the roadside. Many of them were painted by hand, demonstrating the depth of feelings of those who had made them. That week, the smart money was still on Hillary Clinton. We all know how that turned out.\nSomething similar is happening with the grassroots movement to restore the Tappan Zee name to the new bridge across the Hudson. You can see it in the lawn signs that are popping up in hamlets near the span. You can hear it in the diners and at the gas pumps.\nThose who find no reason to revisit the \u201cGov. Mario M. Cuomo Bridge\u201d name have underestimated the intensity and breadth of growing public sentiment.\nA POLITICAL BRIDGE TOO FAR? Newly aligned bills would bring back 'Tappan Zee'\nUNBROKEN: Cuomo Bridge's second span gets connected\nCUOMO BRIDGE: How the governor claimed decades of planning as his own\nWhy is pressure growing now? For the same reason our state government has been so sclerotic for decades. The vast majority of New Yorkers don\u2019t pay attention.\nGov. Andrew Cuomo knows this well. A master of statecraft, he exploited that very somnolence when he snuck the name change at the close of the 2017 legislative session, then stuck it in the session-ending reconciliation session. He did it with no fanfare, and not even a token attempt to muster public support.\nHe did it because he could. And he could because no one was looking.\nBut the standard Albany playbook may not work this time. From the American Revolution to the Civil Rights movement, our country\u2019s history is replete with examples of passionate, well-organized groups of individuals who buck the odds and pull off an upset. That may be about to happen again.\nYou already know about the pending legislation to restore the name. Now consider the following:\nA number of area Democrats have told me they would vote \u201cyes\u201d on the bill if it gets to the floor in the Senate and Assembly.\nOn June 7, saveourtappanzee.org plans to deliver a petition to Albany with 110,000 signatures demanding that the original bridge name be restored.\nThe Orangetown Town Board passed a resolution May 15 in support of A8914A and S7671, legislation that seeks to add \u201cTappan Zee\u201d back to the bridge\u2019s name.\nThe Hudson Valley\u2019s genteel historical societies, for whom controversy has typically meant what type of finger sandwiches to serve at the garden party, also have supported legislation to add back \"Tappan Zee.\" Resolutions have been passed by the Historical Society of the Nyacks and the Historical Society of Rockland County, so far.\nTo Albany\u2019s powerbrokers, the opposition is an alien species.They must have no idea what to make of them. Their driving passion is \u2014 what? Not political, but historical? The political animals must be asking: What do they really want?\nIt\u2019s simple, actually. Just keep the historic Tappan Zee name, with roots going all the way back to the Tappan Indians who first inhabited our region, and the subsequent Dutch settlers (\u201cZee\u201d means \u201csea\u201d in Dutch).\nCuomo persists in viewing the issue through the same shopworn lens, claiming these newly minted activists are politically \u201crabid.\u201d But it is, in fact, the support for the \u201cGov. Mario M. Cuomo Bridge\u201d that is political in nature.\nNot unlike those struggling farmers in the Rust Belt, we New Yorkers are a busy, distracted people, mostly preoccupied with paying the bills. It\u2019s been part of our character ever since the Dutch established the location as a mercantile trading post. We really don\u2019t care much about Albany politics \u2014 until we do.\nFurther up the Hudson River, there\u2019s another famous character whose name is on a bridge: Rip Van Winkle. Just like him, we\u2019re awakening from a very long nap.\nThe writer, a Tappan resident, is a former New York City TV reporter and member of two Hudson Valley historical societies.",

Read our first impressions of the latest smartphone with 48-megapixel camera.\nOppo F11 Pro is a new mid-range smartphone with 48-megapixel rear camera. Priced at \u20b924,990, the smartphone will go on sale in India on March 15.\nApart from a 48-megapixel camera, highlights of Oppo F11 Pro include a pop-up selfie snapper and premium design. It also comes with a 4,000mAh battery with Vooc ultra-fast charging capabilities.\nThe smartphone's design is also eye catching with its 'gradient colour' in two options of 'Thunder Black' and 'Aurora Green'. The smartphone adds another choice to users in the mid-range price segment. Here's our first impression of the new Oppo F11 Pro.\nDisplay, design\nStarting with the first attractive feature, Oppo has put in efforts on the design and look of the phone. Smartphone brands like Honor, Oppo and Vivo have extensively popularised the gradient colour effect. The F11 Pro is no different. We have the 'Aurora Green' variant of the F11 Pro and the smartphone does look beautiful. Its blue-green effect has a subtle tone to it and doesn't appear tacky.\nThe power button on the F11 Pro also has this thin green accent which looks pretty. A small detail but it adds to the overall design of the phone. Thanks to the pop-up camera, Oppo F11 Pro has a true edge-to-edge display with no notch or punch-hole camera. Watching videos on the F11 Pro will be a delightful experience with every inch of the screen used.\nUnapologetically heavy\nOppo F11 Pro is pretty heavy. It's 2019 and glass bodies or big batteries can no longer be excuses for the extra weight, especially on a 25k smartphone. The F11 Pro isn't slim either. With phones aiming to be lighter and slimmer, it's surprising the F11 Pro turned out different.\nPerformance\nPerformance on the F11 Pro can only be determined after a review of the phone. In terms of specifications, the smartphone comes with MediaTek's Helio P70 chipset paired with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Oppo's usage of Helio P70 seems questionable considering the Realme 3 priced at \u20b98,999 is available with the same chipset.\nOn the software front, Oppo F11 Pro runs on ColorOS 6.0 based on Android Pie. With the new custom OS, Oppo has finally introduced an app drawer. The animations seem similar to Xiaomi's MIUI 10 especially the brightness and volume bar. ColorOS is however still heavy with multiple pre-installed apps and custom apps too.\nCamera\nCamera is undoubtedly the highlight of the F11 Pro. Catching on the increasing trend, the F11 Pro also offers a 48-megapixel camera. It also comes with 'ultra night mode' called 'nightscape' for low light photography. I tried out the camera with nightscape turned on. This feature does add extra brightness to photos but it misses out on details.\nThe pop-up selfie camera is placed at the centre of the phone. Smartphones with this camera mechanism have the pop-up camera on the side. I fiddled with the selfie camera and tried out the portrait mode. It still doesn't get the job right as my hair ended up being blurred along with the background.\nSumming up,\nOppo F11 Pro does come with attractive features like its design and the pop-up selfie camera. However phones cheaper than the F11 Pro also offer a 48-megapixel camera and Helio P70 chipset. We can arrive at a better judgement after reviewing the smartphone.",

One of those, Charles Kavanaugh, previously sued the archdiocese for libel after being defrocked.

The Washington law prohibits telecom providers from blocking content or devices, throttling traffic, or participating in paid prioritization.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously incredible,\u201d said Democratic Washington state Representative Drew Hansen, who originally introduced the bill, in a phone interview. \u201cWe passed net neutrality with overwhelming bipartisan support, proving that it\u2019s really not that hard for elected officials to listen to their real bosses: the people. I just wish congress would do the same.\u201d\nOther states, such as California, New York, and Illinois, have made significant progress towards passing state-level net neutrality protections, but so far only Washington and Oregon\u2014which has a law that won\u2019t go into effect until next year\u2014have signed them into law.\nThere are other states with some protections in place, but they aren\u2019t as broad as Washington\u2019s. The governors of multiple states, including New York, Montana, and Vermont, have issued executive orders imposing net neutrality requirements. But these orders only apply to ISPs that have contracts with the state, and don\u2019t cover all customers.\nAnother tactic some state lawmakers have been trying is to sue the FCC. More than 20 states have filed lawsuits, hoping to legally reverse the FCC\u2019s decision and restore net neutrality nationwide, rather than creating a patchwork of protection state-by-state.\nAt the federal level, the Senate passed a resolution in May to overturn the FCC\u2019s decision and restore net neutrality. That resolution is now being considered in the House, where Democrat members are hoping to force a vote.\nIn the meantime, I hear Seattle is nice this time of year.",
    "https://www.vice.com/en/article/vbjpmx/astronomers-found-a-rogue-planet-12-times-the-mass-of-jupiter": "Astronomers discovered a massive rogue planet that is over 12 times the mass of Jupiter with an unrivaled magnetic field, according to new research published in the Astrophysical Journal . This marks the first time a rogue planet has been detected based on its radio emissions, which opens the door to an entirely new method of exoplanet discovery.\nRogue planets are celestial bodies that don\u2019t orbit a star and instead orbit around the galactic center in interstellar space. There have only been a handful of rogue planets discovered to date, although some astronomers think there may be tens of thousands of rogue planets for every star in the galaxy.\nAdvertisement\nThe recently discovered rogue planet SIMP J01365663+0933473 was first detected in 2016, but was originally mistaken for a brown dwarf. These so-called \u201cfailed stars\u201d are dense collections of gas that are too massive to be considered a planet, yet not massive enough to sustain the nuclear fusion that gives other stars their energy.\nSIMP was a part of five brown dwarfs being studied by astronomers at the Very Large Array to learn more about how these wannabe stars produce such strong radio emissions. Yet when the original observational data was revisited by an independent team of scientists, it was discovered that SIMP was likely a massive gas planet, not a star.\nRead More: Stop Blaming Everything on Planet Nine\nTrying to determine when a huge, dense ball of gas should be considered a brown dwarf rather than a planet is a bit like trying to determine how many grains of sand constitute a sand pile versus a sand heap. The boundary is an ongoing subject of debate among astronomers, but the general rule of thumb is that planethood starts below 13 Jupiter masses, which is known as the \u201cdeuterium-burning limit\u201d because that is approximately the point when deuterium fusion stops.\nSIMP is 12.7 times the mass of Jupiter, which puts it just this side of planethood.\nLocated only 20 light years away (about five times the distance to our closest stellar neighbor, Alpha Centauri), SIMP is estimated to be about 200 million years old and has a magnetic field 4 million times stronger than Earth\u2019s. This strong magnetic field produces incredible auroras on the planet, much like the auroras seen at Earth\u2019s poles, but on a far larger scale. These large auroras produce strong radio emissions, which led to the discovery of SIMP in the first place.\nThe presence of these auroras is something of a mystery, however. On Earth, auroras are produced when our magnetic field interacts with solar wind. Rogue planets don\u2019t orbit a star, however, and thus are not exposed to solar wind. One possible explanation for the auroras is that they are caused by a moon in orbit around the rogue planet, much like Io creates auroral flares on Jupiter.",

He said he\u2019s been throwing for three or four days.\n\u201cMy arm feels great,\u201d Eovaldi said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to take it slow with everything and just make sure we build up the right way.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, he\u2019ll throw his first bullpen session since surgery.\nBecause he was able to prepare himself for the season and stretch his arm out to 104 pitches before the surgery, Eovaldi feels like he won\u2019t need much time to get back into game shape.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t really lose much,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were able to keep my arm and mobilities, things like that, weight, exercises. Arm still feels good and strong and I\u2019m coming out to play catch, just making sure we\u2019re not doing too much.\u201d\nTrying to keep him from throwing 100 mph too quickly will be a difficult task for manager Alex Cora. Eovaldi has a tendency to let it rip at full strength whenever he throws.\n\u201cPhysically, he is who he is,\u201d Cora said. \u201cHe went through this process last year. The only difference, he was coming off (Tommy John) surgery, too. So, they had to take care of him in that aspect. Now, it\u2019s just the bone chips, so I think compared to last year, he\u2019ll be back sooner than the previous year.\u201d\nIt took Eovaldi two months until he was back on the field post-surgery in 2018.\nPEDROIA BACK ON THE FIELD\nThe process is speeding up for Dustin Pedroia.\nHe began a rehab assignment with Triple-A Pawtucket on Friday, just five days after stopping his rehab with Double-A Portland due to left knee soreness.\nPedroia played six innings at second base for the PawSox and was 1-for-3. He is set to play three games in a row over this weekend.\nHe never played three in a row during his previous rehab assignment, and played three in a row at the big league level just once this year.\nBrock Holt will also continue rehabbing in Pawtucket. Holt, who has fully recovered from the scratched cornea in his right eye, served as the designated hitter Friday but will begin to play the field soon.\n\u201cWhen he starts playing positions we\u2019ll talk about decisions and all that stuff,\u201d Cora said.\nWith so many injuries in the infield, the Sox have chosen to play with a short bench, going with just three extra position players while they\u2019ve carried 13 pitchers.\n\u201cWe still hit for the people we feel have to hit late in games, matchup-wise,\u201d Cora said. \u201cSometimes Mitch Moreland gets to first, you think about pinch-running but you have to wait for him to get to second. If we\u2019re not going to steal here, ground ball double play and we lose Mitch. So that\u2019s the only thing. Besides that, it\u2019s been comfortable on the other end with the bullpen.\u201d\nCORA CHEERS ON BRUINS\nThe Bruins making the Stanley Cup finals excited the Red Sox manager.\n\u201cI work in probably the greatest sports city in the states right now,\u201d Cora said. \u201cI mean, this is fun. I\u2019m not a hockey fan but I work here and I got caught up watching hockey yesterday.\n\u201cHopefully it happens. Having three trophies in the same city at the same time? Wow, that\u2019s cool\u2026Amazing run. And you see the vibe of the city. They love their teams here. They love it.\u201d\nODDS AND ENDS\nDavid Price (elbow tendinitis) will likely return from the injured list to start Monday against the Blue Jays, Cora said.\nCatcher Sandy Leon was placed on the paternity list before Friday\u2019s game and catcher Oscar Hernandez was added to the active roster from Pawtucket. Right-hander Chandler Shepherd was designated for assignment to make room on the roster.\nStruggling outfielder Jackie Bradley Jr. got a night off against right-hander Gerrit Cole because Cole is so tough on lefties. Bradley is \u201cworking on a few things, too,\u201d Cora said. He\u2019ll play Saturday and Sunday.\nFriday marked the start of 33 games in 33 days for the Red Sox. They were 3-4 against the Astros in the regular season last year before ending Houston\u2019s season in five games in the American League Championship Series.\nSince the start of May, the Astros rank first in the majors and the Red Sox second in runs per game.",

At this point, Harvard even seems to concede that it did so. Instead, it argues that it was justified in this discrimination because it had bigger fish to fry. Specifically, it claims that the elusive goal of balancing its entering class to its preferred racial composition justifies this conduct. The Justice Department contends it has other, race-neutral ways to accomplish this same goal.\nI cannot predict what the judge will do. These are complicated legal issues and the case may very well may get dismissed. But the underlying problem does not go away.\nAt what point are we willing to sacrifice individuals in order to achieve societal goals? Harvard and its supporters claim that rectification of prior discrimination against certain groups \u2014 principally African-Americans and Hispanics \u2014 justifies what they do. This is very little comfort to the individuals who otherwise would have been admitted and whose forebears cannot even be credibly claimed to be responsible for past practices. Indeed, history tells us they were generally victims.\nFurther, the defense would sound a bit more principled if Harvard hadn\u2019t disguised its discrimination by claiming that Asian-Americans seem to be less likable or don\u2019t have positive personalities. That kind of subterfuge strongly suggests that Harvard knew that what it was doing was wrong. Even worse, it recalls other groups \u2014 such as Jews, Italians and Irish \u2014 who suffered from the same type of discrimination in the past, often justified by the same kind of assertions that they just \u201cwouldn\u2019t fit in.\u201d\nHarvard should stop weaseling. It should admit its past practices and live or die by its justification. Then we as a society can confront the choice between individual rights and group rights.\nOne other thing Harvard has to confront: It has tried to have its cake and eat it, too. In multiple documents, Harvard has officially agreed not to discriminate on the basis of race, color or national origin. It does so to reap as many federal dollars as it can. It seems Harvard is not willing to proclaim the very principles it now espouses are so important.",

Smollett\u2019s co-stars and colleagues on \u201cEmpire,\u201d celebrities such as Ellen Page and Zendaya, and public figures such as Sen. Kamala Harris rallied behind the actor, releasing statements of support. However, Smollett\u2019s account is now being challenged, with police investigating whether or not he paid two acquaintances, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, to stage the attack.\nChicago police confirmed on Tuesday that they received a tip from someone claiming to have seen the three men together in an elevator of Smollett\u2019s apartment building on the evening of the attack. However, later in the day, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted that the tip was unfounded.\nIf Smollett falsified a police report, the charge is a Class 4 felony in Illinois, and carries a potential sentence of one to three years in prison. Smollett could also be ordered to pay restitution to compensate for the cost of the Chicago Police Department investigation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very, very serious situation,\u201d said Phil Turner, a former federal prosecutor who now works in criminal defense in Chicago. \u201cHe\u2019s got some very significant exposure.\u201d\nSmollett told police that two men attacked him at 2 a.m., poured bleach on him, and put a noose around his neck. He also claimed they told him that it was \u201cMAGA country,\u201d a reference to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign slogan. Chicago investigators are now seeking to speak with Smollett.\nFederal investigators are also probing a threatening letter that was sent to the \u201cEmpire\u201d set. The letter included homophobic language and contained a white powder, which was later determined to be a crushed painkiller tablet. Should that letter turn out to be fake, federal prosecutors could also pursue a mail fraud charge, legal experts say.\nAndrew Weisberg, a former prosecutor in the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, said Smollett could get probation, assuming that he has a clean record. But he also said prosecutors may face pressure not to be lenient.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very high-profile case,\u201d he said. \u201cProsecutors tend to be tougher because everybody\u2019s watching. \u2026 I think they may come down hard, in terms of not reducing it to a misdemeanor.\u201d\nSteve Greenberg, a Chicago defense attorney, said prosecutors could also file a charge of obstruction of justice. He said it was likely, though, that Smollett would be allowed to plead to a misdemeanor, and not serve jail time.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to ruin a guy\u2019s life over this,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cPeople make false reports all the time to the police. They get in a DUI, they call police and say, \u2018My car was stolen.\u2019 Ninety percent of the time, even if they\u2019re charged with a felony, those people end up pleading to a misdemeanor.\u201d\nSmollett has retained two criminal defense attorneys, Victor Henderson and Todd Pugh. They have denied that Smollett staged the attack, and said he will continue to cooperate.\n\u201cHis lawyers may be having a psychiatrist examine the guy so they could prepare some kind of psychiatric defense,\u201d Turner said.\nSmollett, like celebrity fabulists such as Lance Armstrong and Ryan Lochte, may see endorsement opportunities and roles dry up if he is found to have been untruthful. Public relations experts say he will need to demonstrate that he\u2019s learned a lesson.\n\u201cIf he made this up, he broke the trust of a lot of his fans,\u201d said Ray Drasnin, founder of Purple Penguin PR. \u201cSay you lied and you\u2019re sorry for that lie. Apologize to the people who have supported you, promise to make it up, and find a cause that\u2019s near and dear to your heart and devote yourself to it.\u201d\nRichard Levick, chairman and CEO of LEVICK, said people shouldn\u2019t rush to judgment regarding Smollet and cautioned that there are still, in the words of former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, \u201ctoo many unknown unknowns.\u201d Yet if Smollett did fabricate the attack, Levick says he needs to be more proactive.\n\u201cHe needs to get ahead of this as much as he can,\u201d he said. \u201cHe needs to go see the police. He needs to apologize. He needs to make the announcement about what happened instead of letting the facts leak out.

    "https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/01/19/kyrie-irving-celtics-get-past-hawks/": "ATLANTA \u2013 On a night when Brad Stevens lamented his team\u2019s inability to deal with adversity on the road, the Celtics finally gave him a surprise with Saturday night\u2019s 113-105 win over the Atlanta Hawks.\nBeyond their early trouble on the home court of yet another mediocre team, the Celtics were forced to fight without Marcus Smart, ejected in the third quarter after attempting to charge at Hawks forward DeAndre Bembry.\nStripped of their emotional leader, the Celtics hit back from a variety of angles, with Jaylen Brown (nine fourth-quarter points) and Al Horford (13 points) carrying the team down the fourth quarter stretch.\nPer usual, Kyrie Irving filled in all the available gaps with a 32-point, five-trey performance.\nBut on a night that cried out for Smart\u2019s gritty approach to the game, the Celtics carried on in that style without him. They overcame a 16-point second quarter deficit \u2013 the result of some hot early offense from the likes of the Hawks\u2019 Kevin Huerter and John Collins \u2013 and played their best basketball down the stretch with a 10-0 game-sealing run in the last five minutes.\nIt appears, though, Smart wasn\u2019t merely upset with Bembry, or two rapid-fire calls from referee Scott Foster leading up to his implosion.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a competitor \u2013 he wants to get himself going, wants to get us going, and he wasn\u2019t happy with the way we were playing,\u201d Horford said. \u201cHe let his emotions get out of hand, but after that we had to refocus and understand we had a game at hand and continue to play well.\u201d\nStevens certainly got what he was looking for, after observing before the game that unlike last season, when the team had the best road record in the Eastern Conference, the Celtics haven\u2019t recovered well on the road this season.\n\u201cThis was a good win for us,\u201d the coach said. \u201cWe need that kind of response to what we\u2019ve done in the last few opportunities.\u201d\nThe Celtics, who have never been streakier in the Stevens era, thus erased memory of their 0-3 trip through Miami, Orlando and Brooklyn with a three-game win streak \u2013 Saturday night\u2019s on the second half of a back-to-back.\nTerry Rozier, this time with an expanded role because of Smart\u2019s absence, once again helped change Saturday night\u2019s course with his energy and ball pressure as much or more than his offensive role.\n\u201cMan, I think Terry\u2019s energy, picking up full court, rebounding the ball, making plays, and the rest of the group followed,\u201d Horford said. \u201cJaylen also had some good plays. The bench really got us going, and then we were ready to finish the game.\u201d\nHorford\u2019s tip-in of a Jayson Tatum miss with 1:47 left gave the Celtics a 107-100 lead. He had just scored the last six Celtics points in the 10-0 run, which Irving capped in grand style when, after nearly slipping and losing the ball during a drive, he wheeled into the lane with a running hook for a 109-100 lead with 1:11 left.\nThe volatile nature of the third quarter considered, with Smart storming to the locker room after his second technical foul, the Celtics came out of the stretch in decent shape, cutting the Atlanta lead to 89-83 on an Aron Baynes jump hook.\nRozier, whose energy was pivotal during the winning streak the Celtics carried into Saturday night, triggered the Celtics\u2019 best move of the night with five straight points early in the fourth off a 3-pointer and fast break dunk off a steal.\nThe result was a 14-2 Celtics run that included a Baynes tip dunk and a Brown 3-pointer for the Celtics\u2019 first lead of the night at 95-93 with 9:07 left.\nTrey Young lost the ball in the lane, leading to Brown\u2019s drive for a foul, two free throws and his seventh straight point \u2013 four of those from the line.\nYoung\u2019s 3-pointer finally got in the way, cutting the Celtics lead to a point (97-96) with 7:55 left. But Brown drove for his ninth straight point and a 99-96 lead.\nAlen Len scored twice, including a jump hook for a brief 100-99 Hawks lead before Irving drove to take the lead back.\nBoth sides stumbled, from Tatum\u2019s block of Jeremy Lin and an air ball by the latter to a Horford travel call.\nHorford nearly compounded the stretch when he missed an open layup. But he was fouled on the rebound, and with a section of fans chanting \u201cYou\u2019re a traitor,\u201d hit twice for a 103-101 lead.\nIrving launched an air ball the next time down, but Horford made good again, getting fouled while grabbing a Tatum miss and converting twice, now for a five-point lead.\nAnother Young miss led to a Tatum drive, and a Horford put-back with 1:47 left for a 107-100 Celtics lead that would stick.",

It is hoped that the meeting can produce a series of consensual recommendations on how to approach future cyber threats emerging from the 5G network.\nAndrej Babi\u0161, photo: \u010cTK/V\u00edt \u0160im\u00e1nek\nLaunching the government\u2019s Prague 5G Security Conference on Thursday, Andrej Babi\u0161 emphasised the revolutionary nature of 5G.\nThe packet of new systems promises a vast expansion to the capabilities of wireless devices, expanding bandwidth from todays 10 or 20 megabytes per second to up to 20 gigabytes.\nThis potential is expected to bring about major changes not just in the use of technologies such as self-driving cars and home appliances, but also in governance.\nBut experts and intelligence agencies have been warning for years of the security risks involved in adopting the new network technology.\nParticularly noticeable have been the ongoing efforts of the United States to persuade their allies not to involve Chinese companies in their 5G infrastructure for fear their technology could be used for spying.\nYet, while Australia and New Zealand have already announced they will avoid Huawei products in their 5G infrastructure development, Britain and Germany have signalled the opposite.\nBuilding a path towards consensus in 5G security is therefore one of the main reasons why the Czech prime minister decided to hold the two-day conference.\nIt is hoped that the Prague meeting of over 150 experts and representatives from the Western world can produce an agreement on recommendations that will be used when discussing the future approaches within the EU, NATO and UN.\nHowever, Czech leaders are also split on the issue.\nTom\u00e1\u0161 Pet\u0159\u00ed\u010dek, photo: \u010cTK/V\u00edt \u0160im\u00e1nek\nMr. Babi\u0161\u2019s government has listened to the warning of the country\u2019s National Cyber and Information Security Agency regarding the use of Huawei technologies in critical infrastructure and commissioned a cyber-security audit.\nBut Czech President Milo\u0161 Zeman has defended the Chinese tech-giant, stressing they are the leaders in the field and, according to the weekly Respekt, urged Mr. Babi\u0161 to include Chinese company representatives at the conference.\nThe importance of inviting allies was stressed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Tom\u00e1\u0161 Pet\u0159\u00ed\u010dek, whose ministry is hosting the event.\n\u201cAt this conference we are contemplating the model of cooperation among countries in an area where absolute trust is necessary\u2026The countries on which we may become technologically dependent must be trusted and reliable.\u201d\nWhile parts of the conference are available for public viewing on the website of the Office of the Government, the most important security concerns are being discussed in private.\nNevertheless, the conference did produce an important statement from the prime minister when it comes to domestic affairs. On Thursday, he announced that mobile operators are expected to set up their 5G networks in the Czech Republic by 2024.\nThis will be preceded by a frequency auction in November and the subsequent division of frequency bands in 2020.",

These games will feature Sweden vs. Switzerland and Colombia vs. England, a pair of contests that have the potential to be highly exciting due to the relatively even skill levels amongst the teams involved. It would hardly be surprising to see both of these showdowns come right down to the wire, the same ending that so many other battles have had during the knockout stage of this riveting tournament.\nSportsbooks have installed both England and Switzerland as favorites, but neither is heavy enough chalk to imply a lopsided match. It\u2019s also interesting that these are the sides projected to advance given both finished as the runner-up in their respective groups and are going up against squads that topped the table during the group stage. Regardless, the Three Lions are still the largest favorite of the day, opening at +110\u2014a bet that would return $1.10 for each $1 risked\u2014to beat the Colombians in regulation. The Coffee Growers are a tad less than 3-1 (+290) to pull an upset in the day\u2019s later game, while the draw is set at +210. Those looking to wager against the spread can get Colombia +0.5 goals at -135 (wager $1.35 to win $1) odds, while the English have that same +110 number on the -0.5 goal line. Switzerland is expected to get the better of their opponent in the day\u2019s first contest, coming into it as slight, +165 chalk. The Blue-Yellow aren\u2019t far behind that line and are getting +205 odds to win in regulation, although a tie seems slightly more likely at +190. Oddsmakers are calling this one a pick \u2018em and didn\u2019t handicap an outright win by adjusting the goal line, although the A-Team (-130) are favored over the Swiss (+105) to advance.\nWill the Round of 16 finish with two more incredible, competitive matches that could end in an upset, or will these wind up being thorough victories for the favorites? It seems anything could happen in Russia during the knockout stage, which is why Jon Price of SportsInformationTraders.com has been asked for his take on the outcome of these contests.

However, the Hardys made an appearance on Smackdown, and it would appear they will challenge for the tag-team titles. It's possible Shinsuke Nakamura and Rusev and The Bar could find their way into the match as well.\nJohn Cena\nGetty\nAlmost no one likes the idea of Kurt Angle's retirement match happening with Baron Corbin.

    "https://www.forbes.com/sites/hunterfelt/2018/09/24/boston-celtics-sell-optimism-on-media-day/": "It feels like it's been summer for a long time, but autumn has finally arrived in New England and basketball season is soon to follow. The Boston Celtics are about to start training camp and, if you ask them, everything's as cool as the upcoming weather. Now, they would say that, as the weeks leading up to the preseason, which culminated with today's Media Day festivities, basically amount to an opportunity for NBA teams to advertise the upcoming season. For this year's Media Day, what the Celtics were selling was optimism.\nGranted, the Celtics are in a better position to convince their fans that the next nine months are going to go swimmingly than the majority of the other teams in the league. They're coming into the season as the Eastern Conference favorites and, if the Celtics' starting lineup remains healthy, some experts even have them pegged as the second most talented team in the league. Still, this is New England, where high expectations are often paired with deep-rooted pessimism. There have been lingering concerns about this team throughout the offseason and it's in the team's best interest to assuage their fans' biggest fears before they start trying to sell them tickets and merchandise (oh and Gatorade).\nThe spin began earlier this month when the team addressed last season's biggest disappointment. Gordon Hayward, only months removed from signing a four-year, $128 million contract, suffered a season-ending ankle injury in his Celtics debut. While Boston had remarkable success without him, there's no question that any chance that the Celtics have as far as making a championship run this year lies with having a healthy and effective Hayward.\nSo there Hayward was, addressing the media for the first time in ages, assuring everybody that he would be ready for the start of the regular season, although he's still working his way to being 100%. \"The last step for me as far from a physical standpoint is a little explosion,\" he said during the September 13th press conference, \"that little last juice bounce that you get. So that's going to take me the longest time, but like I said, for the most part, I feel very good.\"\nMeanwhile, Kyrie Irving, who also says he's heading for a full recovery following season-ending surgery, is trying to convince everybody that, despite rumors to the contrary, he's not heading anywhere. In an interview with ESPN's Jackie MacMullan, Irving pulled out all the stops in emphasizing that he sees himself in Boston for the foreseeable future. \"Who wouldn't be a part of this?\" he proclaimed while confidently saying that the Celtics could beat the Golden State Warriors in a seven-game series. As far as those ever-present rumors that he wants to team up with Jimmy Butler, who is currently working his way out of Minnesota? Why, Irving says he hasn't talked with Butler since 2016.\nNothing, of course, compares to the feel-good vibes of Media Day, the Monday before training camps officially open across the NBA. Is Jayson Tatum, coming off a phenomenal rookie season, going to be happy with fewer minutes after his breakout last season? \"We have a lot of coachable guys on this team that are willing to do whatever it takes to win,\" he said while also repeating the line that the team can hold their own against the Warriors.\nJaylen Brown might end up coming off the bench this season, despite a playoff campaign that proved he would be a starter on most teams. He didn't think the team's crowded roster would affect team chemistry either, adding \"we don't see each other as enemies. We don't want to beat each other up too much. We're trying to beat up whoever else we're going to be competing against.\"\nSome of this preseason optimism is just for show, an attempt at putting the best face possible heading into a year where the expectations could not be higher. That doesn't mean that the players don't also feel it. After an off-season where management went all-in with the previous season's roster, why wouldn't everybody involved feel good about their chances? When Irving and Tatum say that they have a chance at beat the Warriors in the NBA Finals, they believe it. They're not just trying to put up a front to convince the media and, thus, their fans (although they might also be doing just that).\nThe Celtics were a very good team last season. They should be an even better one this time around. There will be plenty of time for worry and doubt during the grind of the regular season as they face the inevitable challenges that the 82 game schedule will throw at them. This? This is a time to be cheerful. Basketball is back in New England, in every possible way.",

After breaches of trust at Facebook led to private information being shared and abused by Cambridge Analytica and others, and Google was just fined more than $57 million USD for privacy violations under the GDPR regulation that went into effect last year, people and companies are on high alert when it comes to data privacy.\nCybersecurity Experts Weigh In\nI reached out to a number of IT professionals and cybersecurity experts to get their commentary and insight on Data Privacy Day, and their advice and tips for how you can do a better job of restricting access to information and protecting data:\nJadee Hanson, CISO for Code42\n\u201cWhen it comes time to protect data, it\u2019s important to understand that data privacy and data security go hand in hand. There\u2019s no way an organization can move into privacy controls around using and sharing data \u2013 and the notice and consent that comes with it \u2013 without a strong foundation of data security.\nWith a strong security foundation in place, companies can talk about the rules and principles of data privacy. They should begin by looking at the terms of data agreements on both sides \u2013 from both a company data and customer data perspective \u2013 and then layer on the standard privacy principles around use, notice, sharing, consent, transparency. These principles typically apply to different companies in different ways, so it\u2019s a good practice to work closely with legal teams on what and how privacy principles apply to different businesses. Of these standard principles, the concept of use is probably the most critical one. Companies need to clearly understand the rules around what data they can and can\u2019t use, and then be transparent about how they\u2019re using that data.\u201d\nSteve Blow, Tech Evangelist, Zerto\n\u201cAll businesses know by now that they need to prioritize data protection \u2013 there\u2019s certainly enough headline scare stories of data leaks, outages and ransomware attacks that should have persuaded them over the past year. Adding to this is the modern consumer perspective of \u2018there\u2019s no excuse for downtime, or the loss of data\u2019. Businesses need to be focusing on ensuring they are resilient against the many threats facing data today, to prove to their customers they are taking data protection seriously.\nThe adoption of the latest technology, with innovative new approaches, has led to this number of both planned and unplanned disruptions in a business rising. Combating this means companies need to start looking outside of traditional backup capabilities to keep the business online; they need to choose a modern, resilience approach that can utilize continuous data protection.\u201d\nJack Danahy, SVP, Security at Alert Logic\n\u201cThe remarkable immediacy of social media has created a deceptive kind of artificial intimacy between people and their devices. Communications feel very personal, very one-to-one, but they are really neither. Improving and ensuring privacy requires educating users about the risks and the natural exposures present in this environment, and we need to be constantly on the lookout for both accidental oversharing and intentional attempts to breach these growing confidences. Instead of attempting to isolate users from the rest of the internetworked community, it is time to empower them to share more knowingly and more safely.\u201d\nAli Golshan, CTO and co-founder at StackRox\n\u201cConsidering the volume and range of data being collected from services and users, targeting and reaching the user has become a very personal experience. We can clearly see the negative impacts of it in politics and American culture.\nAnalytic infrastructures allow for powerful insights into data, but they create compliance and security risks for companies because data is often dumped into data lakes without proper labeling, auditing, or policy enforcement. We are seeing companies such as Apple building trust with customers by providing visibility and transparency into how that data is used. Additionally, Europe's GDPR require all companies serving European citizens, regardless of the company\u2019s HQ location, to implement controls around data privacy.\u201d\nGary Watson, CTO of StorCentric and Founder of Nexsan\n\u201cThe notion of data protection might be starting to sound repetitive, but it is still top of the business agenda. IT security threats come in all different shapes and sizes, and just as quickly as we put up barriers, cyber criminals find new ways to break through. Businesses need to have confidence in their recovery strategy; relying alone on the traditional ways of backing up data is not sufficient. Organizations need to ensure everything is protected including the data, finances and the organization\u2019s reputation. Threat detection software is only half the battle, keep in mind \u2018what if any attack succeeds?\u2019 and ensure there is a second line of defense in place that can offer a comprehensive range of security features, from encryption through to backup, hardened archiving, and recovery. Alongside product investment, take the time to educate employees on the latest threats, which in turn will build confidence.\u201d\nHeather Paunet, Vice President of Product Management at Untangle\n\u201cData privacy has become a hot topic over the last few years, especially with the recent large-scale data breaches. It is important that organizations of all sizes take data privacy seriously and proactively ensure personally identifiable information (PII) is protected. Protecting data in the event of a breach is crucial to maintain the trust and respect of the public. Businesses can take some simple steps to protect the data they are collecting. Storing the private data on a network or server that is separate from the public, or even separate from the main corporate network, can provide an extra layer of protection. Encrypting the data, especially PII, is another standard practice to comply with a variety of regulations like PCI and HIPAA in the United States and GDPR in Europe. With GDPR in full effect, data privacy and transparency are now more relevant than ever. Businesses must realize that the GDPR rules are not a hindrance, but a chance to show consumers that they can trust them and that they are taking a proactive approach to data privacy.\u201d\nJoseph Carson, chief security scientist at Thycotic\n\u201cIs Data Privacy Day turning into Data Privacy Remembrance Day? Is it even reversible?The answer is yes. The end of privacy as we know it is closer than you may think. Privacy definitions are very different between nation states and cultures, however, one thing that is common is that privacy is becoming less and less of an option for most citizens. In public, almost everyone is being watched and monitored 24/7 with thousands of cameras using your expressions, fashion, walk, directions, interactions and speech to determine what you need, what you might be thinking, who you are going to meet, who is nearby and even algorithms that determine what your next action might be. All of this is used to help provide a custom experience unique to everyone as well as predict and prevent security threats. The term \u201cif you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear\u201d is quickly becoming reality and privacy and could certainly disappear in the near future. Can we ever regain back our privacy?\u201d\nSumming Up\nSolving data privacy is the tech equivalent of curing cancer or fixing world hunger. It is a huge problem with a dizzying array of factors and nuanced variables involved. As clich\u00e9 as it is, there is no one right answer. Companies need to do everything they can to safeguard data\u2014especially personal information from customers. Businesses that function in the economy of monitoring, collecting, and selling personal data on individuals should only do so with explicit consent and absolute transparency.\nAs ideal as that would be, it still wouldn\u2019t be a guarantee. Individual consumers still need to be vigilant about protecting their own data. Be careful about which companies you trust your privacy with. More importantly, invest the time and effort to understand the data security and privacy controls available to you and make sure you take steps to configure them to limit access and protect your data.",

    "https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2018/10/19/friday-night-fortnite-tournament-startend-times-rules-scoring-prizes-and-how-to-enter/": "Credit: Epic Games\nIt would be easy to be confused about the name, but take note: this is not Friday Fortnite, the Keemstar-hosted Fortnite tournament that served as the first major professional Fortnite event. Keemstar's Friday Fortnite was eventually cancelled after Epic kept scheduling Fall/Summer Skirmish events on Friday night, and as a sort of nail in the coffin the developer has apparently decided to start holding its own in-game weekly tournament and naming it Friday Night Fortnite. The first one starts tonight, so read on for rules, timing, scoring and more.\nStart/End Times: The first Friday Night Fortnite starts tonight, October 19. It runs from 7:00-11:00 p.m. local time and once it's done, it's done. The tournament system is still very much in the early phases, so there may well be technical problems during that time.\nRules/Scoring: Friday Night Fortnite is a squad mode, and it does not appear that it will have matchmaking for your own team: you'll need to bring along three friends if you want to compete. Scoring is similar to what we saw in the first Alpha tournament: points are awarded for both placement and elimination, with up to a total of six points from a given match. As some people have been figuring out, it sometimes pays to just drop into Tilted, rack up some kills and then die rather than try to tough it out to the end.\nYou enter through mode selection, and you can see details under the \"events\" tab in the lobby.\ncredit: epic Games\nPrizes: Just like with the previous solo tournament, the prize is a shiny pin. You'll need to get 25 points to earn your pin, and you're restricted not by the number of matches played but by the 7:00-11:00-time range.\nMatchmaking: A regular Fortnite match has platform-based rather than skill-based matchmaking. Touchscreen players play against each other, controller players play against each other, etc. Not so here: things are meant to be more difficult as the tournament goes on, so you'll be matched with other people that have a similar point total as you regardless of platform. It's a bold idea, and it's not without its problems: touchscreen players will always be destroyed by PC players, for example. This is one of those systems that are very much still in progress.\nExpectations: Things have been a little rough with these tournaments so far between queuing, matchmaking and other problems. That's why Epic is billing these as practice runs, with the full tournaments yet to come. Just don't go in expecting something totally smooth, and know that you might not get all the points you're after due to technicalorf other problems. It's a work in progress.",

From eliminations in Shifty Shafts to chest searching in Junk Junction, here are this week's Free and Battle Pass challenges.\nRemember, solving all of these will unlock a secret loading screen, leading you to the 10-point Road Trip Battle Star.\nFree Challenges\nSearch Chests In Junk Junction (0/7)\nUse Rift Portals (0/3)\nEliminate Opponents in a Single Match (HARD) (0/3)\nBattle Pass Challenges\nCredit: Epic Games\nSearch Chests In Junk Junction\nJunk Junction has a number of pretty easily accessible chests and it's not as central as Loot Lake or some of the other locations we've had chest-hunts this season, so it shouldn't be quite as dangerous. You'll find some spawns on top of heaps of cars. Others will spawn in buildings around the area. All the chests in this area are potential spawns, not guarantees.\nCentral Junk Junction: 1 chest spawn\nOn the second floor of the main building in the Junk Junction behind a crate in the room with the black-and-white checkers.\nWestern Junk Junction: 3 chest spawns\nWest of Junk Junction by the western entrance.\nNorthwest of the area on top of some compacted cars.\nOutside the western fence behind the brick wall next to an ice cream truck.\nSouthern Junk Junction: 3 chest spawns\nOn the south-side of the big main building there's an attic room with a possible chest.\nSouth of Junk Junction at the foot of a stack of cars behind a metal fence.\nSouthwest on top of the large bank of compacted cars you can find a chest.\nUse Rift Portals\nRift portals are randomly spawned but do tend to show up in certain locations more than others. Particularly in locations impacted by the Season 5 changes like the desert area and Paradise Palms; the Durr Burger hill in the northwest section of the map; and in Viking Village.\nEliminate Opponents in a Single Match / Shifty Shafts / Deal Damage\nMight as well get both of these at once. Head to Shifty and take out three opponents in a single match and you'll get a two-for-one. Or, if you're more devious, load up a Solo match and go camp at Lazy Links. That's where your enemies will be shooting holes of golf. Let them take the shot (it's the polite thing to do) but then you should have some easy pickings.\nAnd hey, if you can get some of these eliminations with a Clinger, Stink Bomb or Grenade, you can wipe out three challenges in fairly short order.\nThat's all for week 5. Check out previous Season 5 weeks and the solutions to those challenges below.",

There had been a swing of just under one per cent against Mr Irons at 8.30pm, with 45 per cent of the votes counted.\nShe would wait for pre-polling results.\nAnd Anne Aly, in Cowan, was fighting for survival.\nA senior Liberal source last night confided the party\u2019s internal polling had shown a narrow victory to the Coalition.\nThe source said the Liberals would hold Swan, Stirling and Hasluck and they had not given up on winning Cowan.\nThe insider said Pearce and Canning had never been in doubt.\nIn perhaps the story of the election in WA, Pearce MP and Liberal heavyweight Christian Porter saved his northern suburbs seat and his career.\nThere had been a swing of about 3 per cent towards him.\nGiven no chance of retaining the seat six months ago, Mr Porter was on course to defeat his Labor opponent, former police superintendent Kim Travers.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there was a single political commentator six months ago who gave us a chance,\u201d he said as he cast his vote in Ellenbrook.\nLast night he said the past three or four years had become particularly challenging as his seat went from 70 per cent country towns down to 30 per cent in recent years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very different seat to when it was created,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt is a different seat from six years ago when I was elected.\u201d\nLabor\u2019s planned changes to the housing market were big drivers behind the Pearce vote, with large numbers of young mortgage holders across the sprawling northern suburbs and more house building in the Swan Valley.\n\u201cLabor\u2019s housing tax was critical to my electorate,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s been very soft house prices post the boom, so the idea that someone would deliberately come and tax owning another property which would drive buyers out of the market was something I was at pains to explain to all of my constituents, and its likely to have had an impact in my seat and others in WA as well.\u201d\nA senior Labor source told The Sunday Times yesterday the arrival of Scott Morrison as Liberal leader and Prime Minister last August had \u201cbeen a game changer in WA\u201d.\n\u201cThe Coalition ship was about to go down, heading towards and iceberg when Malcolm Turnbull was prime minister,\u201d the Labor source said.\n\u201cThen they changed captains and while the ship still hit an iceberg they managed to save some lives.\u201d\nWA Treasurer Ben Wyatt, who joined Labor supporters at Ms Beazley\u2019s campaign function in Belmont, last night said: \u201cWe can\u2019t hide away from it, it is an extremely disappointing result (nationally).\n\u201cThere is no doubt the entire Labor community will be incredibly disappointed with what we\u2019ve seen tonight.\n\u201cIn WA we have done better than we have in some time in certain seats, certainly I don\u2019t think we will have a result in Swan or Stirling tonight.\n\u201cWe may win both of those seats but it will likely come down to pre-poll votes.\u201d\nSWAN\nCamera Icon Steve Irons. Credit: Justin Benson-Cooper\nIron-man sees off another challenger\nHannah Beazley\u2019s bid to launch a third chapter in her famous family\u2019s political dynasty appeared destined for the scrap heap last night.\nAs results from the Eastern States indicated a shock swing towards Scott Morrison and the Coalition, Ms Beazley\u2019s supporters gathered at her campaign HQ in Belmont were deflated.\nTony Abbott\u2019s concession speech drew hearty cheers, but they were quickly replaced by downcast faces as early counting in the seat of Swan had Liberal incumbent Steve Irons on track to win a fifth term.\nHowever, in an electorate heavily divided on political lines between suburbs such as South Perth and Como on one hand and Belmont and High Wycombe on the other, results from different booths swung the contest wildly first one way and then the next. At time of print Mr Irons had suffered a swing of 1.4 per cent against him but was on track to retain the seat.\n\u201cWhat is this rubbish,\u201d one elderly gentleman in a Beazley T-shirt said, shaking his head as national results appeared to depict an unlikely victory for Mr Morrison. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it again. The last time we had an election all we had to do was win three seats here (in WA) and we couldn\u2019t do it then either,\u201d he said.\nMs Beazley arrived at her function just after 8.30pm to rapturous applause, declining to concede defeat but admitting the count was not what she had hoped for.\n\u201cIt looks like we have a bit of a swing to us, we don\u2019t know if it is enough and I have been told there are too many votes still to count for us to know for sure,\u201d she said. \u201cSo unfortunately I come here to you with no result.\n\u201cI have grown up with a belief that if you see a hole you fill it. If you see something that can be done better you put your hand up and you try and do it. That is what we did here in Swan.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a politician, yet, so I can keep it short and sweet. I\u2019m really sorry I couldn\u2019t do this for Bob (Hawke) but I hope we can next time.\u201d\nPERTH\nCamera Icon Patrick Gorman celebrates. Credit: Daniel Wilkins\nGorman ahead in Perth\nPerth Labor MP Patrick Gorman was set to retain his seat last night, holding off Liberal challenger Jim Grayden during early counting.\nThe incumbent won the seat with a 3.3 per cent margin in a by-election after Tim Hammond resigned last year.\nGorman led the inner-city electorate on 55 per cent of the vote with 54.9 per cent of the ballots counted at time of printing.\nThe former WA Labor secretary, who is sharing his election night party with incumbent MP for Cowan Anne Aly, was hesitant to express confidence at his chances of re-election.\n\u201cMy advice to everyone is do not have too many celebration drinks too early. Pace yourself. It\u2019s going to be a long night,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis is my first time for re-election since a strange by-election last year.\u201d\nBRAND\nKing ahead despite swing\nLABOR member for Brand Madeleine King, pictured, looked likely to retain the Federal seat for her party last night, leading with 57.8 per cent of the vote at time of printing with 49.1 per cent of all votes counted. Widely viewed as one of the ALP\u2019s safest seats, the party has held Brand since its creation in 1984. Labor experienced a swing of 3.7 per cent against it, but still maintained a healthy buffer.\nMs King replaced former member Gary Gray, who made the decision not to re-contest in 2016.\nMOORE\nA bit Moore of the same\nThe Liberal Party was once again good enough for Moore\u2019s voters, who were set to return incumbent Ian Goodenough as their representative for a third term last night.\nMr Goodenough held his two-party preferred vote at about 61.64 per cent.\nThis was despite losing primary votes to One Nation.\nLabor candidate Tony O\u2019Gorman failed make any substantial ground for Labor, gaining 38.36 per cent of the vote once preferences were counted.\nThe outcome was a flashback of 2016, where almost identical results of about 61 per cent to 39 cent in Mr Goodenough\u2019s favour were recorded.\nCANNING\nCamera Icon Federal Member for Canning Andrew Hastie. Credit: Daniel Wilkins\nLabor\u2019s Hastie retreat\nAndrew Hastie said he was in shock at the Liberals\u2019 stunning results across Australia as the former SAS soldier retained his seat in Canning.\nThe returning Liberal MP paid credit to Prime Minister Scott Morrison for getting the Coalition over the line.\n\u201cWho would have thought we would be here tonight, I\u2019m still shocked,\u201d he said.\n\u201c(Mr Morrison) is a man who deeply cares about Australian people, he is an excellent leader he has great instincts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an overwhelming result, a result we can all be proud of.\u201d\nCanning was initially billed as one of Labor\u2019s five target seats on its WA hit-list.\nHeld on a margin of 6.8 per cent, Canning had the longest odds of the five Labor hoped would fall its way.\nWith 52 per cent of the vote counted last night, Mr Hastie was ahead of Labor candidate Mellisa Teede 62-38 per cent.\n\u201cWe have a lot of resources here, people are concerned about our long-term security and sovereignty, so when I go to Canberra I make sure the Commonwealth Government has its back,\u201d Mr Hastie said.\nEarlier in the day, the ex-serviceman said he had been \u201cquietly confident\u201d he would be returned.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a peri-urban seat and it\u2019s a very mixed demographic \u2014 we have a lot of workers down here, FIFO workers, seniors, pensioners, working families, so it made sense for Labor to make a play early on but we did the work,\u201d he said.\nThere was a jovial mood among Liberal volunteers at their Mandurah Country Club function last night as the reality they were likely to hold on to Government became apparent.\n\u201cThings have really come together under Scott Morrison, he has been a great leader, and exceptional campaigner,\u201d Mr Hastie said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s really balanced the party and signalled to a lot of working families he is a leader they can trust to look after them and their welfare.\u201d\nMs Teede started her election day by voting in Byford before travelling to Mandurah at the close of polls. Cheers subsided among the Labor faithful as the results came in.\nHASLUCK\nCamera Icon Ken Wyatt. Credit: Danella Bevis\nKen a winner four sure\nKen Wyatt declared victory in Hasluck last night.\nPredictions of a tight contest did not come to pass, with early counting showing the Minister for Aged Care on track to comfortably retain his seat with a swing of 2.7 per cent as at 10.30pm last night.\nMr Wyatt said he was surprised at the Coalition\u2019s strong showing because pre-election polling predicted a Labor win, but said the franking credits issue was a problem for Bill Shorten.\n\u201cPeople were starting to worry about the impact the franking credits and the loss of that income which was important,\u201d Mr Wyatt said.\n\u201cPeople want certainty, and I don\u2019t think the Leader of the Opposition explained his costings as well as he could.\u201d\nMr Wyatt made history in 2013 by becoming the first Member for Hasluck to be re-elected for a second term, and he did it again by winning\nHasluck for a third term three years later.\nMr Wyatt held Hasluck with a 2.1 per cent margin after the last election, but the latest polling ahead of yesterday\u2019s poll suggested the seat was 50-50 on a two-party preferred basis between Wyatt and Labor candidate James Martin.\nMr Wyatt said earlier in the week that cost-of-living pressures and protecting the Hills environment were key issues that Hasluck voters had raised with him during this campaign.\n\u201cPeople were talking about things that were important to them, I\u2019ve always operated on the basis I don\u2019t care whether it\u2019s State government, local government or Federal political issues, I will fight for the people of Hasluck on any of those matters,\u201d he said.\nHasluck covers Perth suburbs including Midland, Glen Forrest, Mount Helena, Mundaring, Kalamunda, Maida Vale, Forrestfield and Kenwick.\nMany voters said cost of living and managing the economy were key factors in who they voted for. And the battle for one of WA\u2019s most marginal seats has been high on drama.\nMr Wyatt had former prime minister John Howard by his side to add some star power in the lead-up to the election, but his campaign was marred by reports of a toxic work environment including claims of bullying and intimidation within his office, and questions over a $750,000 staff travel bill in 18 months.\nMeanwhile, Labor\u2019s original candidate Lauren Palmer quit just months out from the election, leaving the party scrambling for a new nominee before settling on Mr Martin, a Shire of Mundaring councillor and software company director.\nWhen he first won Hasluck at the 2010 election, Mr Wyatt became the first indigenous Australian to be elected to the House of\nRepresentatives, and he now runs the aged care, seniors and indigenous health portfolios.\nBURT\nCamera Icon Matt Keogh. Credit: Andrew Probyn\nKeogh certain in Burt\nLabor held firm in the seat of Burt as votes were tallied last night, with Matt Keogh holding a margin of about 5.8 per cent at time of print.\nKeogh won the seat in 2016 and looks set to continue his reign over the electorate, despite a swing against him of 4.2 per cent.\nThe Labor incumbent lost ground to minor parties, notably One Nation.\nLiberal Candidate David Goode was trailing Mr Keogh by 11.62 per cent.\nCOWAN\nCamera Icon With two thirds of votes counted, Dr Aly had won 51 per cent ahead of Liberal challenger Isaac Stewart on 49 per cent on a two-party preferred basis. Credit: Justin Benson-Cooper\nAly feels the love as battle tightens\nLabor MP Anne Aly\u2019s slim hold on the seat of Cowan went down to the wire during counting last night.\nWith two thirds of votes counted, Dr Aly had won 51 per cent ahead of Liberal challenger Isaac Stewart on 49 per cent on a two-party preferred basis.\nDr Aly had a joint election night party with Perth incumbent Patrick Gorman in West Leederville, but did not show up to the beginning of the event where the mood was decidedly muted.\nEarlier, she had been quietly confident of retaining her seat in what she said had been a tough, but mostly good-spirited battle.\n\u201cI think you can be as confident as you can be, but the one thing that I have learnt about politics is that it always comes down to the polls at the end and the hard work that you have done,\u201d she said yesterday.\n\u201cI am confident that I have done enough hard work that I can look myself in the mirror and say I have done the hard yards.\u201d\nBut Dr Aly \u2014 who wrestled Cowan from the Liberals in 2016 with a 0.7 per cent margin, making her the first Muslim woman elected to Federal Parliament \u2014 revealed one moment that upset her during the closely contested campaign.\nSomeone had taken an image of her and drawn a noose around her neck and then left it by a tree.\n\u201cSomeone took a corflute and drew a noose around my neck and hung it on a tree,\u201d Dr Aly said. \u201cBut that\u2019s OK. It was Wanneroo. I don\u2019t know who did it but the attitude I take is that there will be people who don\u2019t like you \u2014 and you don\u2019t need to focus on that.\n\u201cYou need to focus on the love and support you have and surround yourself with that.\u201d\nLikewise yesterday, Liberal supporters in Cowan were saying their confidence was growing that Mr Steward, a first-time candidate, could claim back the seat.\nA YouGov Galaxy poll conducted for The West Australian last week showed Dr Aly would increase her margin in the seat by 2.3 per cent.\nBut former Liberal State government minister Paul Miles, who was volunteering at the Wanneroo pre-polling station, said Cowan was now too close to call.\n\u201cI think the change of prime minister has really invigorated our party and I think people have seen that,\u201d Mr Miles said. \u201cScott Morrison is able to connect with people while some politicians are disconnected.\n\u201cFrom my point of view, it\u2019s too close to call in Cowan. A few months ago I would have thought it was over. Now, nobody can tell you.\u201d\nMr Stewart is employed by the West Australian Football Commission as a community development manager working with local football clubs.\nPEARCE\nCamera Icon Pearce candidate Christian Porter. Credit: Will Russell\nNegative gearing plan decisive: Porter\nAttorney-General Christian Porter has easily held his northern suburbs seat of Pearce, with the frontbencher pointing to Bill Shorten\u2019s planned changes to negative gearing rules as the issue that hit home with locals.\nSpeaking before a room of jubilant supporters at a campaign party in Mindarie, Mr Porter revealed that he had made a secret promise to his campaign team he would get a tattoo if he increased his margin.\n\u201cI will be getting ink,\u201d he told the cheering crowd.\nMr Porter claimed a strong win against Labor\u2019s candidate Kim Travers, despite predictions his seat might have been one of a number in WA that could fall to Labor.\nAt the point of declaring victory, Mr Porter had attracted a swing of almost 3 per cent \u2014 holding 56 per cent of the vote on a two-party preferred basis. Joined on stage by his wife Jennifer, Mr Porter said his team had run a tight, grass roots campaign.\n\u201cThis has been the sort of campaign they said they would bring against us,\u201d he said.\nMr Porter also paid tribute to his father Charles \u201cChilla\u201d Porter, who he said was watching from home and undergoing cancer treatment.\nMr Porter mused about polling which had consistently pointed to a Labor win nationally, with the Attorney-General suggesting surveys had missed issues happening at a micro level.\n\u201cWhat polls in Australia at least don\u2019t seem very good at doing is predicting things at a more granular level,\u201d Mr Porter said.\n\u201cAnd States in Australia are very different from one another.\u201d\nMr Porter cited what he called Labor\u2019s \u201chousing tax\u201d as the main factor in the battle for Pearce \u2014 a reference to the Opposition\u2019s plan to restrict negative gearing to newly build properties. \u201cMy observation is that Australians who have a mortgage don\u2019t like being taxed more,\u201d Mr Porter said.\nAsked about the apparent poor showing of Clive Palmer\u2019s United Australia Party, despite all the millions the businessman had spent on advertising, Mr Porter said:\n\u201cThat would have to be something you ask him (Mr Palmer) and his shareholders.\u201d\nEarlier yesterday, the minister took aim at his Labor opponent, former police\nsuperintendent Kim Travers, over her election posters that showed images of her in uniform. Mr Porter revealed he raised the issue with Police Commissioner Chris Dawson on Friday night, as the politicisation of the police force was not allowed.\nHe said Mr Dawson had taken action on this matter.\n\u201cIt is a well-known requirement that where WA Police officers are candidates for political election, they may not use images or vision of themselves in WA Police uniform in any campaign material or context,\u201d Mr Porter said in a statement yesterday.\n\u201cIt is totally inappropriate to politicise the WA Police Force. Bill Shorten\u2019s candidate should know this.\u201d\nMr Dawson revealed he had received two complaints on Friday and had contacted Ms Travers \u2014 a recipient of the Australian Police Medal in 2015 \u2014 to relay his concern and disappointment.\n\u201cMs Travers is no longer a police officer,\u201d Mr Dawson said. \u201cShe was required to resign from WA Police Force in order to stand as a candidate in the election. I expressed my view to Ms Travers that the posters adversely politicised WA Police and that the force should always be regarded as apolitical.\u201d\nIt\u2019s understood Labor began to remove the posters at the Commissioner\u2019s request, but claims they complied with AEC requirements.\nA Labor spokesperson defended Ms Travers\u2019 record as a police officer and a proud candidate.\nMr Porter, who held the seat with a 3.6 per cent margin and came to the contest reportedly armed with a large war chest of campaign funding, said he believed he would win the seat as the Liberals were selling a \u201csuperior product\u201d to local voters.\nSeats like Pearce were said to be central to the Government\u2019s preference deal with Mr Palmer. The battle has attracted national interest, with Mr Shorten citing the seat early in the contest as one of the WA seats that Labor should be aiming to win as part of his path to The Lodge.\nFREMANTLE\nCamera Icon Member for Fremantle Josh Wilson. Credit: Simon Santi\nJosh Wilson\u2019s seat safe\nLabor retained its safest WA seat last night, with Josh Wilson leading the way in his electorate of Fremantle.\nMr Wilson was leading with 57.6 per cent of the vote just after 8pm, with 20 per cent of all votes counted.\nHe previously held the seat with a margin of 23.3 per cent.\nHe vied against Liberal candidate Nicole Robins.\nLabor was holding on to both Fremantle and Brand last night while the Liberal Party had retained Durack, Forrest, Moore and O\u2019Connor.\nCURTIN\nCamera Icon Celia Hammond has claimed victory in the seat of Curtin. Credit: Notre Dame University\nCurtin held by Liberals\nLiberal Celia Hammond last night cruised to victory in WA\u2019s safest Liberal seat, claiming the seat of Curtin from departing former foreign minister Julie Bishop.\nHowever, the Liberals, who previously held the blue-ribbon seat with a 20 per cent margin, had suffered a 6.8 per cent swing against it as at 8pm.\nMs Hammond said she was \u201cincredibly grateful\u201d for her entire campaign team.\n\u201cEveryone, all the volunteers, have done an incredible job and I\u2019m so thankful for all the encouragement and support,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been exhilarating.\u201d\nAt 8pm, the 50-year-old lawyer and former vice-chancellor of Notre Dame University was leading with 63.9 per cent of the vote, with 20.8 per cent of votes counted.\nProfessor Hammond arrived at the Cottesloe Beach Hotel about 6.30pm, where a crowd of more than 100 supporters, family and friends had gathered at the end of a successful campaign.\nVictory cries could be heard from outside the pub.\nIn between warm embraces, congratulatory hugs, selfies with eager supporters and sips of champagne, Professor Hammond said she had tried to maintain a \u201cpositive campaign that represented this positive country\u201d.\n\u201cI want to follow on from Julie, who was just magnificent,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI want to follow in her footsteps. (She) just was such a passionate advocate for her constituents.\u201d\nDespite the backing by prominent conservatives, including Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, Professor Hammond has previously been criticised as being too conservative for the affluent electorate, which had one of the highest votes in favour of same-sex marriage in the country during the plebiscite in 2017.\nBut Professor Hammond last night brushed those concerns aside, saying she was there to represent the people who did vote for her and the people who didn\u2019t.\n\u201cI\u2019m here to represent everybody,\u201d she said.\nIndependent Louise Stewart last night said her campaign had been \u201cvery challenging\u201d.\nThe 43-year-old said during the six weeks, \u201csome dirty tricks were played\u201d, referring to several media reports that undoubtedly put a damper on her campaign.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be addressing it after the election,\u201d Ms Stewart said, adding she had already been in talks with lawyers regarding \u201cunbalanced reporting\u201d.\nTHE REGIONS\nCamera Icon Member for Forest Nola Marino.

The Virginia coach, with his legendary father Dick in the stands, guided the Cavaliers to a 85-77 victory over Texas Tech in overtime on Monday night in the NCAA championship game.\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy.\nLed by De\u2019Andre Hunter and his NBA-ready game, the Cavaliers turned themselves into national champions, holding off the tenacious, ferocious Red Raiders. The scintillating victory came 388 days after a crushing setback that might have sunk a lesser team for years.\nBut Virginia was better than that.\nBOX SCORE: Virginia 85, Texas Tech 77\nRELATED: Virginia finds redemption by beating Texas Tech\nRELATED: Tony Bennett joins father as Final Four coach\nA season after becoming the first No. 1 seed to lose to a 16 \u2013 the one thing that had never happened in a tournament where anything can \u2013 the Cavaliers watched a 10-point lead turn into a three-point deficit before Hunter came to the rescue. The sophomore made the game-tying three with 12 seconds left in regulation, then made another with just over two minutes left in the extra period to give the Cavs the lead for good.\n\u201cSurreal,\u201d Hunter called it. \u201cIt\u2019s a goal we started out with at the beginning of the season. We knew we were going to bounce back from last year. We achieved our dreams.\u201d\nAfter going scoreless for the first 18 1/2 minutes, Hunter finished with a career-high 27 points, and if he leaves as a lottery pick \u2013 well, what a way to go.\nHe helped the Cavs bring home the first NCAA title for a program with a colorful, star-crossed and, now, very winning history.\nRalph Sampson was in the house, but now it\u2019s possible that Sampson and the name \u201cChaminade\u201d won\u2019t be at the top of Virginia\u2019s resume anymore.\nOr \u201cUniversity of Maryland-Baltimore County.\u201d That was the No. 16 seed that stunned the Cavs in the first round last year, its playful social media manager online Monday night tweeting congratulations shortly after the final buzzer. Hunter missed that game with a broken wrist, but nobody thought they\u2019d miss him THAT much.\nEach of Virginia\u2019s 34 wins leading to the final, and each of its scant three losses, were all punctuated by the reminder that only the end result would serve as the ultimate report card on whether the Cavs could truly shed the baggage of last year.\nWhat a ride this was.\nA 1 seed once again, they fell behind by 14 early to 16th-seeded Gardner-Webb in this year\u2019s opening round, and a nightmare seemed to be unfolding. But this time, they overcame it. Then, they beat Purdue in the Elite Eight when the game looked lost, and did the same against Auburn on Saturday \u2013 getting bailed out by a foul call and Kyle Guy\u2019s three free throws with 0.6 seconds left.\n\u201cI told them, I just want a chance at a title fight one day,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I want. \u2026 You\u2019re never alone in the hills and the valleys we faced in the last year.\u201d\nHunter\u2019s key three in OT gave Virginia a 75-73 lead, and after the teams traded possessions, Tech guard Davide Moretti scrambled after a loose ball heading onto Virginia\u2019s end of the court. It appeared it would be Texas Tech ball, but a replay showed Moretti\u2019s pinkie finger had barely scraped the ball. Virginia got possession, and worked the ball into Ty Jerome, who got fouled and made two free throws.\nBrandone Francis missed a three on the other end, and Virginia pulled away \u2013 the first time this game felt remotely comfortable, even after Guy made a three to give the Cavs a 10-point lead with 10:22 left in regulation.\nGuy is not Virginia\u2019s only clutch free-throw shooter, by the way. The Cavs went 12 for 12 from the line in overtime to ice this game. They scored the game\u2019s final 11 points.\nAs for the Red Raiders (31-7), well, what can you say?\nThe team full of overlooked grinders refused to quit.\nThey fell behind by 10 twice in this game \u2013 seemingly too much in a matchup between two legendary defenses that allowed way more than the projected total of 118 points \u2013 but just kept coming back.\nJarrett Culver, also lottery-pick material, made a spinning left-handed layup over Hunter with 35 seconds left in regulation to put the Red Raiders ahead 66-65. After Jerome missed a teardrop on the other end, Norense Odiase got fouled and made two free throws to make it 68-65.\nThe nation\u2019s best defense couldn\u2019t afford to give up a three, but Jerome skipped a pass to Hunter, who was open on the wing \u2013 and spotted up and drained it. Culver missed a 3 with Guy in his face with a second left, and we were headed to overtime, the first extra session in the final since Kansas beat Memphis in 2008.\n\u201cIn terms of my guys, I\u2019ve never been more proud,\u201d Red Raiders coach Chris Beard said. \u201cThis is real life. We\u2019ll bounce back.\u201d\nThe last five minutes of regulation and the OT featured several one-on-one matchups between the two NBA-bound stars, and Hunter came out the winner. He finished 8 for 16 after an 0-for-7 start. Culver, who stayed in his hometown of Lubbock to see how far he could take Tech, went 5 for 22 for 15 points, continuing a cold-shooting Final Four; he went 8 for 34 over the weekend.\nBoth will likely move on to the NBA. Hunter will go there with a title.\nAnd somebody on Virginia ought to grab that sign.\nIn the stands, a fan made a cardboard sign with the capital letters \u201cUMBC\u201d running vertically, and this spelled out after each letter. \u201cUva.\u201d \u201cMakes.\u201d \u201cBig.\u201d \u201cComeback.\u201d\nThe Cavs couldn\u2019t have written it any better themselves.",

(Photo by Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)\nMichigan men's basketball is looking for a new head coach after John Beilein stepped down today to take the same job with the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers. It will be tough to replace Beilein, who did a masterful job in 12 seasons with the Maize and Blue.\nMichigan was in a lengthy NCAA Tournament drought before Boeheim took over in 2007, and he snapped it in his second season. Overall, the Wolverines made nine NCAA Tournaments under Beilein, reaching the national championship game twice. He also won two Big Ten regular season titles and two Big Ten Tournament titles.\nWithout question, Michigan AD Warde Manuel will be under pressure to make a big hire.

While he said he'd personally hire Northwestern's Chris Collins for the job, Goodman thinks the Wolverines will ultimately land former Florida head coach and current Oklahoma City Thunder boss Billy Donovan.\nDonovan has been the head coach of the Thunder since 2015, but he's under scrutiny after three-straight first-round exits.

Philadelphia was eliminated in gut-wrenching fashion.\nThe Toronto Raptors advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals in a classic Game 7, winning 92-90 on a ridiculous buzzer-beater by Kawhi Leonard. Leonard's shot will go down as one of the most memorable in NBA history.\nAs the Toronto team and fans celebrated, Embiid appeared beside himself as he walked off the court. He was visibly in tears and had to be consoled on the court by a few Raptors players.\nIn the tunnel leading to the locker room, the TV cameras caught Embiid in tears.\nEmbiid finished with 21 points and 11 rebounds in a losing effort. He's young, and will hopefully be back in this situation again.\nHowever, Philly has some choices to make this offseason. Namely, they must decide what to do with Tobias Harris and Jimmy Butler, and explore if they want to shake up the team's core at all. Oh, and head coach Brett Brown may be fired.\nMeanwhile, the Raptors are one step closer to the NBA Finals. They'll play the Milwaukee Bucks for the right to go there.",

Later that day, Musk released a company blog post elaborating on his tweet.\n\u201cAs a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m trying to accomplish an outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible, and where there is as little change for all of our investors, including all of our employees, as possible.\u201d\nIn his lawsuit, Isaacs argued that Tesla and Musk did not address the claim from who, where and how the funding to take the company private was secured in the blog post or in other media.\nStart your day with the news you need from the Bay Area and beyond.\nSign up for our Morning Report weekday newsletter.\nIn a separate follow-up tweet Tuesday, Musk wrote, \u201cInvestor support is confirmed.

    "https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/09/09/texas-officer-arrested-on-manslaughter-charge-in-mans-death/": "By RYAN TARINELLI and KEN MILLER\nDALLAS (AP) \u2014 A white Dallas police officer was arrested Sunday on a manslaughter charge in the off-duty shooting of a black neighbor whose apartment she says she mistook for her own.\nOfficer Amber Guyger was booked into the Kaufman County Jail after being taken into custody, the Texas Department of Public Safety said in a news release. The department said the investigation is ongoing and that no additional information was available.\nStart your day with the news you need from the Bay Area and beyond.\nSign up for our Morning Report weekday newsletter.\nA jail employee said Guyger was released on bond. Online records initially showed Guyger was in custody, but she later was not listed on the jail inmate roster.\nGuyger fatally shot 26-year-old Botham Jean on Thursday at Jean\u2019s apartment. Lawyers for Jean\u2019s family had been calling for Guyger\u2019s arrest, saying the fact that she had remained free days after the shooting showed she was receiving favorable treatment. They held a news conference Sunday night, shortly before the arrest was announced, making another plea for the officer to be taken into custody and saying their team had presented new evidence \u2014 a witness and video footage \u2014 to prosecutors. They didn\u2019t provide details.\nThe family attorneys weren\u2019t immediately available for comment after the arrest came.\nS. Lee Merritt, one of the attorneys for Jean\u2019s family, said Saturday that the man\u2019s loved ones weren\u2019t calling on the authorities to jump to conclusions or to deny Guyger her right to due process. But Merritt said they wanted Guyger \u201cto be treated like every other citizen, and where there is evidence that they\u2019ve committed a crime, that there\u2019s a warrant to be issued and an arrest to be made.\u201d\nGuyger, 30, is a four-year veteran of the police force. The Dallas Police Department released her name Saturday night.\nPolice Chief U. Renee Hall said the day after the shooting that her department was seeking manslaughter charges against Guyger. But she said Saturday that the Texas Rangers, who have taken over the investigation, asked her department to hold off because they had learned new information and wanted to investigate further before a warrant was issued.\nJean\u2019s family has also hired attorney Benjamin Crump, who is best known for representing the families of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown. Martin, a black, unarmed 17-year-old, was shot and killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer in 2012 in Sanford, Florida. Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old, was shot and killed by a white police officer in 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri.\nCrump has also represented the families of Stephon Clark and Terence Crutcher, both also black and unarmed. Clark, 22, was fatally shot earlier this year by officers in the backyard of his grandparents\u2019 home in Sacramento, California. Crutcher, 40, was shot and killed by a white police officer in 2016 in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\nAccording to police, Guyger shot and killed Jean after returning in uniform to the South Side Flats, where they both had apartments, following her shift. She reported the shooting to dispatchers and she told officers who responded that she had mistaken Jean\u2019s apartment for her own.\nMany questions remain about what led Guyger to shoot Jean. Hall said the officer\u2019s blood was drawn at the scene so that it could be tested for alcohol and drugs. Investigators haven\u2019t released the results of those tests.\nJean\u2019s mother, Allison Jean, wondered whether race could have been a factor. Her son, who grew up in the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia before attending college in Arkansas, is black. Guyger is white.\n\u201cIf it was a white man, would it have been different? Would she have reacted differently?\u201d Allison Jean said Friday.\nJean wasn\u2019t the first person shot by Guyger. She shot another man, Uvaldo Perez, on May 12, 2017, while she was on duty.\nAccording to an affidavit in the case filed against Perez, police were looking for a suspect when Guyger and another officer were called to assist a third. Perez got out of a car and became combative with Guyger and another officer. A struggle began and Guyger fired her Taser at Perez, who then wrested it away from her. She then drew her gun and fired, wounding Perez in the abdomen.\nGuyger was not charged in the 2017 shooting.\nSgt. Mike Mata, president of Dallas\u2019 largest police employee organization, the Dallas Police Association, on Saturday called for an \u201copen, transparent and full investigation of the event,\u201d the Dallas Morning News reported.\nRelated Articles Crime and Public Safety | Despite years of shootings, beatings and dog bites, these East Bay cops have avoided discipline.

There's an ex-judge and onetime Tennessee attorney general. There's also a policy director at a Latino advocacy group.\nSeven are African-American, three are white and one is Hispanic. Six are men, five are women and two are openly gay.\nAt a long and tedious meeting Tuesday night, the Metro Council elected a diverse group of individuals who will make up a new, closely watched, citizen-led board that will review the actions of Nashville police.\nThe council whittled down a list of a whopping 155 nominees to nine final appointments, choosing several endorsed by the activist group that led the referendum push to create the new community oversight board. Two others appointed by Mayor David Briley won council approval last week.\nThe council's nine selections include four from neighborhoods that are considered economically distressed: Ashlee Davis, a diversity and inclusion strategist at Cargill; Jamel Campbell-Gooch, a Nashville organizer; Andres Martinez, who works at the Latino advocacy group Conexi\u00f3n Am\u00e9ricas; and Brenda Ross, a retired East Nashville activist.\nMeet the members:The diverse 11 who make up Nashville's new police oversight board\nThree were nominated by either a community group or by petition: Former Nashville Police Chief Emmett Turner; Adele Lewis, deputy chief medical examiner for the Tennessee Department of Health; and Danita Marsh, a former Nashville police officer who was critically injured on duty and now works for the Nashville Conflict Resolution Center.\nThe final two were nominated by individual council members: Nashville attorney and former Circuit Court Judge Matthew Sweeney; and Walter Holloway, a third former police officer appointed to the board.\n(Read more about each selection at the bottom of this story.)\nThe voting stretched until nearly midnight. The election process required the choices of all 33 council members present to be read aloud. It involved multiple rounds of voting in each of three categories to fulfill criteria established in a Metro Charter amendment approved by Nashville voters in November by an overwhelming 59 percent to 41 percent.\nThe council unanimously voted last week to sign off on Briley's two nominees, former Tennessee Attorney General Bob Cooper and Phyllis Hildreth, an administrator at American Baptist College.\nMore than half endorsed by Community Oversight Now\nSix of Tuesday's nine selections had been endorsed by the group Community Oversight Now, which led the petition-drive to trigger the referendum, as satisfactory nominees who would \"meet the letter and spirit of Amendment 1.\"\nVice Mayor Jim Shulman, who presided over the vote proceedings, said he's \"never been more proud\" of seeing so many Nashvillians step up to the plate, including many who had never been to the council chambers.\nHe called the vote difficult because there were \"so many good candidates,\" but said he appreciates everyone who stepped forward.\n\"It makes me proud to be a Nashvillian,\" he said as the council applauded the efforts of the nominees.\nThe board, which has the power to compel witnesses in its investigations, is the culmination of a decades-long push from black leaders in Nashville. It can issue reports assessing allegations of misconduct by Metro police and recommend disciplinary action to agencies involved in public safety.\nSupport our work: Subscribe to The Tennessean\nAmendment 1:How the campaign for Nashville's oversight board trounced the well-financed opposition\nWaffle House shooting hero, former public defender's bids fall short\nMore than 180 Nashvillians received initial nominations to serve on the panel.A council committee spent three days last week interviewing all 155 nominees who filled out questionnaires.\nThe Nashville Fraternal Order of Police, which unsuccessfully fought the referendum at the polls and so far in court, in a statement expressed concerns about the short timeline to interview nominees.\nBut the FOP offered support for the new board, saying it \"welcomes the diversity of background and experience that each of the appointed members bring to the board\" and looks forward to working with the members as the FOP \"continues its community outreach efforts.\"\nThe full list of nominees covered an even broader cross section of Nashville and included some prominent city leaders.\nNotable nominees who fell short included Antioch Waffle House shooting hero James Shaw Jr., who didn't receive a single vote, former Davidson County Public Defender Dawn Deaner, multiple former council members, and Sheila Clemmons-Lee, the mother of the late Jocques Clemmons, an African-American man who was fatally shot by a Nashville officer in 2017.\nLegal fight:Community oversight board belonged on the Nashville ballot, appeals court says; vote stands\nWhat's next for the oversight board?\nThe oversight board \u2014 inspired in part by recent shootings of two black men, including Clemmons, by white police officers in Nashville \u2014 must be in operation by March 29 in accordance with the charter amendment.\nBriley is expected to direct the board's next moves before the panel begins its work.\n\"Last night, the Metro Council selected a diverse group of highly qualified individuals for Nashville's Community Oversight Board,\" Briley said in a statement. \"I'm grateful to the council for the hard work of narrowing such an outstanding slate of nominees, and to the nominees for their willingness to serve.\"\nPrior to the November vote, Briley expressed reservations about the proposal.\nAmong his objections were \"politicizing\" the board by having the council in charge of approving nominations. He also cautioned that \"budgeting by charter amendment\" would set a bad precedent. The referendum proposal came with a $1.5 million annual price tag.\nNonetheless, Briley has said he supports the concept of community oversight and will do his part to implement the new board.\nThe state of Tennessee might have the final say over the oversight board, however.\nFollowing November's vote, the board caught the eye of the Republican-dominated state legislature, raising the possibility of intervention on the issue during the current General Assembly session. House Speaker Glen Casada, R-Franklin, has said he plans to explore whether to pursue state action that could preempt the new oversight board. He's raised legal concerns about the panel and said he and other Republicans are concerned Nashville \"wrote it poorly.\"\nWho they are: Nashville's 11 community oversight board members\nAshlee Davis specializes in inclusion and diversity at Cargill and previously worked in President Barack Obama's administration.

Approximately 940 pounds of ready-to-eat salads with chicken sold at Whole Foods are being recalled due to possible salmonella and listeria contamination. According to the United States Department of Agriculture's Food and Safety Inspection Service, the prepackaged meals were made by Sacramento, California-based GH Foods and could contain a tainted corn ingredient.\nThe World's Biggest Food Poisoning Scares\nThe following products are affected by this recall:\n9.75-ounce clear plastic clamshell packages containing \"Santa Fe Style Salad With Chicken\" and \"best if sold by\" dates from October 17, 2018, to October 18, 2018\n10-ounce clear plastic clamshell packages containing \"365 by Whole Foods Market BBQ Style Chopped Salad With Chicken\" and \"best if sold by\" dates from October 17, 2018, to October 20, 2018\nSix-pound bagged kits containing \"BBQ Style Salad With White Chicken\" and \"use by\" dates from October 17, 2018, to October 22, 2018\nEight-ounce clear plastic clamshell packages containing \"365 by Whole Foods Market Chicken Fajita Salad\" and \"best if sold by\" dates from October 17, 2018, to October 20, 2018.\nThese items were produced on various dates from October 9, 2018, through October 13, 2018. All were shipped to retailers in California and bear the establishment number \"EST. P-39994\" inside the USDA mark of inspection. According to the USDA, there have been no confirmed illnesses in connection to this recall. Consumers worried about health issues should contact a medical provider at once. The Daily Meal has reached out to GH Foods and Whole Foods for comment.\nThe consumption of food contaminated with salmonella could result in salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever that show 12 to 72 hours after eating poisoned food. This normally goes away after four to seven days, and most people recover without treatment.\nSimilarly, food contaminated with listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis \u2014 a serious infection that primarily affects the elderly, those with weakened immune systems, pregnant women, and babies. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, headaches, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions \"sometimes preceded by diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms,\" according to the USDA. This illness requires medical attention and can be treated with antibiotics.

Smith, who he has been married to for 26 years.\nOn Monday, The Washington Post published a profile of the trio, with Gasby and Lerner explaining in their own words how their relationship came to be.\n\u201cIf This is Us and Modern Family came together, it would be us,\u201d Gasby told The Post.\nAlex Lerner and Dan Gasby. Karsten Moran for The Washington Post via Getty Images\nThe two met in the summer of 2017 at a Hamptons bar, and struck up a conversation. Romance didn\u2019t come at first. \u201cWe were friends,\u201d Lerner, a divorced mother of three, told The Post, adding that she had socialized with Smith, 69, previously at charity events. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go out with a married man.\u201d\nBut at a breakfast with Gasby and Smith one morning, Lerner realized, \u201cThis is not a man cheating on his wife.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I admire about him is that he takes care of her,\u201d she explained to The Post.\nLerner, in turn, has also begun taking care of Smith.

She also made history as the first African American woman to grace the cover of Mademoiselle magazine, as well as the first African American woman to launch her own brand of home goods (at Bed, Bath and Beyond.)\nHer restaurants have all closed now, with Smith and Gasby instead turning their attention to Alzheimer\u2019s advocacy work. They even chronicled their experience with the disease in the 2016 memoir, Before I Forget: Love, Hope, Help, and Acceptance in Our Fight Against Alzheimer\u2019s.\nAt the time, Gasby told PEOPLE that taking care of Smith was a round-the-clock job. \u201cIt\u2019s the toughest thing I\u2019ve ever dealt with,\u201d he said. \u201cAnybody who is an Alzheimer\u2019s care giver knows exactly what other caregivers are going through.

And though the plague can pass between humans, it is rare, according to health authorities.\nSince 1990, eight people have been diagnosed with bubonic plague in Oregon. Two were found in Idaho. Though the disease can be deadly, it is treatable if caught early.\nThe child lives in Elmore County, where ground squirrels tested positive for bubonic plague in 2015 and 2016. The Idaho Central District Health Department said it found no traces of the disease in squirrels tested this year.\nThe plague shows up within two to six days of exposure. The symptoms include sudden fever, chills, headaches and weakness. Usually, lymph nodes swell in the groin, armpit or neck.\nAbout 11 percent of bubonic plague cases in this country are fatal, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Advances in antibiotics have significantly increased the chance of survival since 1941, when there was a 66 percent chance of death.\nPets will show symptoms if infected. Cats and dogs might also become feverish, have lethargy or a loss of appetite, and the lymph nodes under the jaw will swell.\nThe Central District Health Department recommends people wear insect repellent, long pants and socks when visiting a plague-ridden area.\nThe agency also advises pet owners to ensure their animals are protected from fleas and don't hunt rodents. When a host animal dies, the fleas will leave and look for the next available host, so don't handle wild rodents or dead ones.\n-- Molly Harbarger\nmharbarger@oregonian.com\n503-294-5923\n@MollyHarbarger",

Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic adds that Jansen's condition is considered to be \"very manageable.\"\nJansen was hospitalized prior to the Dodgers' win over the Rockies in Denver on Thursday night and then returned to Los Angeles for additional testing. Jansen dealt with irregular heartbeats earlier in his career, but as MLB.com's Anne Rogers points out prior to Thursday he had not suffered a recurrence since undergoing surgery in October of 2012.\nThis season Jansen in his age-30 season has pitched to a 2.15 ERA/185 ERA+ and a 4.36 K/BB ratio in 54 1/3 innings. He's also racked up an NL-leading 32 saves in 35 opportunities. Jansen, a three-time All-Star, is in the second year of a five-year, $80 million contract with Los Angeles.\nThe Dodgers are of course locked in a tight battle for the NL West title, and losing Jansen for a month or so is a significant blow.

    "https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-schedule-games-today-what-to-watch-in-week-9-tv-channels-kickoff-times/": "Don't you dare overlook Week 9 of this college football season. It's easy to become cynical of the schedule when only a few weekends have a bevy of marquee games. Everyone looking ahead knows Nov. 3 is the weekend for the 2018 season with Alabama-LSU, West Virginia-Texas, Penn State-Michigan games all going down. It's a great slate!\nBut Week 10 doesn't come before Week 9, and as you'll read below, we're starting to get into the good stuff as far as conference play is concerned. A lot of the divisional races around the country are starting to take shape and many of the leaders in those races are either playing each other this weekend, or will play each other in the coming weeks. This is when it gets good.\nSometimes the most unsuspecting weekends yield the most chaos. A number of higher-ranked teams are on the road this Saturday, some of them already underdogs in Vegas' eyes. There are a lot of interesting point spreads out there. So, no, Saturday doesn't have to be an afterthought as we gear up for that vaunted first weekend in November. There's still plenty to enjoy. So get your televisions, laptops and tablets ready. This one should be fun.\nAll times eastern\nThe biggest games\nNo. 9 Florida vs. No. 7 Georgia, CBS, stream on FuboTV (Try for free), 3:30 p.m.: The showdown in Jacksonville matters again, and the winner could very well represent the SEC East in Atlanta. Though both programs are ranked in the top 10, this game takes on a different meaning for each side. A win in Jacksonville would be a cherry on top of what has already been a nice debut for first-year Florida coach Dan Mullen. Georgia, on the other hand, is coming off of a brutal loss at LSU and a second consecutive \"L\" could send the Bulldogs from preseason playoff contender to middle of the pack SEC East team. Rivalry games with stakes are simply the best.\nNo. 18 Iowa at No. 17 Penn State, ESPN, 3:30 p.m.: This could be a big weekend for Iowa. The Hawkeyes are nearly a full touchdown dog on the road, but a win here combined with a Wisconsin loss -- more on the Badgers' precarious situation below -- would keep them in the Big Ten West hunt. Iowa follows this game up with games against Northwestern and Purdue, two other West division players. Meanwhile, Penn State is looking to avoid a third loss in four games with Michigan and Wisconsin still to go.\nNo. 14 Washington State at No. 24 Stanford, Pac-12 Networks, 7 p.m.: Can Washington State follow up its marquee win against Oregon? The Cougars have quickly become the trendy periphery playoff possibility, but they're a field goal dog on the road. This game can also provide some clarity in the suddenly fascinating Pac-12 North race, or muddy it even further. Heading into Saturday, Washington, Washington State and Stanford all have but one conference loss (and Oregon still isn't far behind at 2-2). Yet all three leading teams still have to play each other.\nOther big games\nNo. 2 Clemson at Florida State ABC, noon: The Tigers are a huge road favorite, about 17 points at most Vegas books, and Florida State historically is pretty bad in these situations. Put Clemson's defensive front against FSU's o-line and this one is lopsided. Still, it's Clemson-Florida State and the Seminoles haven't given up on the season yet.\nNo. 20 Wisconsin at Northwestern, FOX, noon: The Badgers are on upset alert this weekend and Northwestern's reputation as an underdog is a big reason why. What was a 6.5-point spread for Wisconsin has now shrunk to four for Paul Chryst's team. A popular upset pick down the road is Northwestern against Notre Dame because it would have huge playoff ramifications, but don't overlook the Wildcats' opening act on Saturday. This one has Big Ten West race implications as both teams have just one conference loss.\nNo. 21 South Florida at Houston, ABC/ESPN2, 3:30 p.m.: The Bulls are undefeated, but they don't grade out well in advanced analytics and are a touchdown dog on the road against the Cougars. This would be Houston's biggest win and, on paper, it's the toughest test remaining on the schedule. Win here and the Cougars are clear favorites to win the AAC West.\nNo. 12 Kentucky at Missouri, SEC Network, 4 p.m.: It's not often that you see the No. 12 team in the country as a touchdown dog. This is a clash of styles with Kentucky's lockdown defense against Missouri quarterback Drew Lock and the Tigers' offense. It doesn't always look pretty with the Wildcats, but if they get a road win here, it sets up a big SEC East showdown against Georgia on Nov. 3.\nNo. 16 Texas A&M at Mississippi State, ESPN, 7 p.m.: This is another interesting line. Mississippi State was a 2.5-point favorite, though the line has dropped to -1.5 for the Bulldogs. The thing is, Mississippi State has zero passing attack and opposing defenses have been loading up the box. That would favor Texas A&M, but good luck blocking one of college football's best pass-rushing defensive lines, Aggies.\nNo. 6 Texas at Oklahoma State, ABC, 8 p.m.: The line is just 3.5 points in favor of the Longhorns, and Tom Herman is far less than a sure thing against the spread as a favorite as opposed to the underdog role. Quarterback Sam Ehlinger will play coming off of a shoulder injury, but how effective will he be? Oklahoma State has its share of problems, but this is a get-up game for the Pokes, and with No. 13 West Virginia coming to Austin on Nov. 3, it's a look-ahead game for the Horns. Hang tight, this one could get weird.\nKeep an eye on ...",

The African nation defended well and did everything in its power to stop a talented, but sloppy Uruguay in Group A play, but it still wasn't enough to get the result.\nJose Maria Gimenez scored a glorious header in the 89th minute as Uruguay earned a 1-0 win and three valuable points in the group. It wasn't close to Uruguay's best performance as a youthful midfield struggled to create, and Luis Suarez wasn't himself. He wasted valuable chances on goal, but the South Americans dug deep, and connected on a late free kick from Carlos Sanchez that found Gimenez perfectly.\nThe win puts Uruguay on three points in the group, while Egypt has zero points and is facing a must-win against Russia in their second match.\nUruguay had 57-percent possession and four shots on goal, but it's a game the team could have had in the bag earlier. Egypt deserved a point in the end with how well they defended, but the late magic was enough and spoiled Salah's birthday.\nThe Liverpool star was expected to play, but coach Hector Cuper kept him off with Egypt defending well. Now, they are going to need him more than ever with six points still up for grabs.\nRelive Uruguay vs. Egypt\nIf you are unable to view the live application below, please click here.",
    "https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-trade-deadline-rumors-phillies-have-interest-in-adrian-beltre-to-upgrade-third-base/": "The Philadelphia Phillies have taken significant steps forward with their rebuild this season. The team is 39-33 coming into Thursday and they're currently tied with the Washington Nationals for the second wild card spot. They're 3 1/2 games back of the Atlanta Braves in the NL East.\nIt is not surprising then that the Phillies are reportedly looking for upgrades prior to the trade deadline. Specifically, they have their eyes on Texas Rangers third baseman Adrian Beltre, according to Jon Morosi of MLB.com. From Morosi:\nThe Phillies also have interest in Beltre, sources say, as much for his professionalism as his production. The Phils have the youngest group of position players in the majors, and team officials see long-term value in Beltre's influence on an emerging core. Plus, the recent injury to J.P. Crawford has opened up more at-bats on the infield.\nBeltre, 39, is hitting .302/.357/.428 (109 OPS+) with three home runs in 45 games around a hamstring injury this season. The power numbers are not what they once were, but Beltre remains a quality hitter and a very good defender at third base. He represents a clear upgrade over Maikel Franco, who's hitting .240/.284/.409 (87 OPS+) with below-average defense.\nAs for the Rangers, they are in last place in the AL West and are expected to sell at the trade deadline, most notably impending free agent left-hander Cole Hamels. Beltre is an impending free agent himself. Given his age and the club's need to get younger, it stands to reason Texas will indeed make Beltre available at the deadline. There should be a good bidding war for his services.\nAt the moment the Phillies have received the worst third base production in baseball -- they are dead last at the position with minus-0.3 WAR this year -- because Franco has been unable to rediscover his 2015 stroke. Furthermore, Philadelphia is averaging only 3.69 runs per game over the last month, so they need a bat regardless of position. Third base is a clear spot to upgrade.",

Ultimately, though, fans got to see all three periods and then some in Philadelphia.\nThe Flyers managed to rally and prevail in a dramatic 4-3 overtime victory against their cross-state rivals in the elements at Lincoln Financial Field. Philadelphia scored two goals late in the third period, including a game-tying goal from Jakub Voracek with 20 seconds remaining in regulation, to force the extra period. It only took a few minutes for Flyers captain Claude Giroux to seal the win with the golden goal in overtime.\nIt was an exciting finish and a big-time win for the Flyers, who are still trying to hang tough in the Eastern Conference playoff race. But as is usually the case with these outdoor NHL games, it was as much about the spectacle and the atmosphere as it was about the actual game being played on the ice.\nThe rain may have made things a little messier than planned, but the game still brought plenty of action and plenty of awesome visuals.

    "https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/2018-pga-championship-picks-expert-predictions-odds-to-win-the-wanamaker-at-bellerive/": "The fourth and final major of the year commences Thursday when the 2018 PGA Championship begins at Bellerive just outside of St. Louis with a massive 156-man field set to take the course. The field will include 110 of the top 112 golfers in the world and has some truly star-studded feature groups, including Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas going off together over the first two days.\nThat trio has combined to win seven of the last 19 PGA Championships with Thomas as the most recent winner at Quail Hollow in 2017. The No. 2 player in the world is also coming off a WGC-Bridgestone Invitational in which he played in the final pairing with McIlroy and ran away from the field. All three of those golfers are having strong seasons and will be among the most-picked players at Bellerive. However, we all have our own ideas of who's going to take the 100th PGA Championship and how it's all going to unfold, including maybe a few surprises you don't see coming.\nLet's take a look at a few who we think are going to have great (or terrible) weeks. Head over here if you are looking for a full list of odds for the entire 2018 PGA Championship field.\n2018 PGA Championship picks, predictions\nKyle Porter, golf writer\nWinner -- Rory McIlroy (12-1): He's finishing in the top 10 on leaderboards without even really playing terrific golf. Every time I watch him, it feels as if he's trying to bend his body to pull a wedge or long iron back in the direction he wants, and yet, he has six top-eight finishes in his last 12 events worldwide.\nTop 10 lock -- Jason Day (22-1): He's coming off a top 10 at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and has finished in the top 10 at this tournament in four of his last five appearances. The body seems to be intact, and it would be surprising to me if he finished outside the top 10.\nSleeper -- Branden Grace (66-1): Top five in two of the last three PGAs and had some nice finishes at big events earlier this summer. I'm not sure he's long enough to contend here (T79 on the PGA Tour in driving distance), but if he finds fairways, he'll be dangerous.\nTop 5 in order: Rory McIlroy, Jason Day, Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler\nBold prediction: Tiger Woods misses the cut. I don't think this will happen, but it's in play. He might be fading a little bit as the season wears on, and a thick, hot St. Louis atmosphere where the rough is tall and the course long won't exactly fit his wheelhouse.\nLowest round: 63\nWinning score: 266 | Winner's Sunday score: 68\nWho will win the 2018 PGA Championship, and which long shots will stun the golfing world? Visit SportsLine now to find out and see the full PGA Championship projected leaderboard from the model that has nailed four of the last seven majors heading into the weekend and was all over Tiger Woods' surprising run at the The Open Championship.\nChip Patterson, golf writer\nWinner -- Patrick Cantlay (50-1): Like Francesco Molinari and Patrick Reed, I've got Cantlay breaking through with his first major championship win in 2018. It's going to take a much stronger performance on the greens than what he's shown so far this season to win, but Cantlay has been among the best on the PGA Tour off the tee and had his best-ever WGC finish last week at Firestone. Kyle said this week on The First Cut podcast that you could take the leaderboard from the WGC-Bridgestone and make it the likely leaderboard for the PGA Championship, and Cantlay was right there at the top with JT, DJ, Koepka and Rory.\nTop 10 lock -- Dustin Johnson (19/2): It just doesn't seem possible for Johnson to play poorly in a PGA Tour event right now. He might make some mistakes that cost him a shot to win, but DJ's game almost always has him in or near the top 10. In 15 starts this season, Johnson has 10 top 10s with three wins.\nSleeper -- Bryson DeChambeau (80-1): The battle for the final Ryder Cup spots is a top three storyline for me at the PGA Championship, and right now DeChambeau is at No. 9, one spot away from automatically qualifying for the team with only one event (this week at Bellerive) to go until the cut. After winning at the Memorial, DeChambeau pointed to the Ryder Cup as a major goal for 2018, and the only way to guarantee a trip to Paris is a strong showing against his competition for that No. 7 or No. 8 spot.\nTop 5 in order: Patrick Cantlay, Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Rory McIlroy, Brooks Koepka\nBold prediction: No one plays well early in the supergroup, which consists of JT, Rory and Tiger Woods. I haven't figured out why (maybe it's too much alpha energy for one space), but I don't think these supergroups have produced much great golf.\nLowest round: 64\nWinning score: 265 | Winner's Sunday score: 67\nAdam Silverstein, golf editor\nWinner -- Justin Thomas (16-1): It's tough to go back-to-back, sure, but Thomas is playing the best golf in the world right now (and has most of the year). I also considered DJ here, but I don't like what I've seen from him recently, whereas Thomas has momentum heading into Bellerive. It also doesn't hurt that this he'll be playing on a second Robert Trent Jones golf course in as many weeks.\nTop 10 lock -- Rory McIlroy (12-1): I could have just as easily picked McIlroy to win the whole thing, and I seriously considered it. Rory is great at PGAs, he's clearly due for a major victory (it has been four years), and the dude is a top 10 machine at majors with 12 in his last 19 such events. Granted, he doesn't have a PGA top 10 since his back-to-back major wins in 2014, but that's another story.\nSleeper -- Tony Finau (50-1): Three straight top 10s in majors this year means he's batting 1.000, and I'm getting him for an absurd value. Granted, he needs to learn how to close and actually win events, but I'll take the hard-hitter on a long course while everyone is salivating over supergroups and Tiger.\nTop 5 in order: Justin Thomas, Bubba Watson, Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson\nBold prediction: Since Kyle and Chip have already taken my \"Tiger misses the cut\" prediction, I'll go in another direction and guess that this year's winner will come from outside the top 10 entering the weekend. In other words, I think Thomas struggles early at Bellerive and sits as many as five shots back entering the weekend before going on an absolute tear Saturday to hop up near the lead. Then there's that Sunday close we all know he's good for delivering.\nLowest round: 64\nWinning score: 268 | Winner's Sunday score: 67",
    "https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/patriots-mascot-apparently-not-hospitalized-after-painful-attack-from-jets-safety-jamal-adams-tackle/": "Every great Patriots Super Bowl run needs a great Patriots controversy. Spygate. Deflategate. Mascotgate (ft. Jamal Adams). The latest thing is the stupidest thing, with Jets safety Jamal Adams tackling Pat the Patriot and the joking about sending him to the hospital.\nThis is very 2019 and very annoying: Adams was at the Pro Bowl and was signing autographs for fans when he decided to take off sprinting down the sideline of the field and tackle the Patriots mascot. Adams delivered a form tackle, knocking the mascot to the ground in what appeared to be a pretty hysterical encounter, because everyone was fine.\nBut then Adams told multiple reporters that he was being harassed by the NFL about the guy in the costume being taken to the hospital, which was a little bit more concerning!\nTurns out he may have been joking -- which would be a weird thing to joke about, but whatever -- because a Patriots spokesman told Mark Daniels of the Providence Journal that the mascot \"was not hospitalized.\"\nI'm not going to sit here and get outraged over this, even if I feel a little duped for writing a story about the Pats mascot being hospitalized because of what Adams told multiple reporters.\nHere are two actual quotes:\n\"All jokes aside, I didn't hit him that hard,\" Adams said. \"I don't know what's really going on, but they did tell me he's in the hospital.\" \"They're not happy with me right now. The NFL is calling my phone, blowing me up, saying that I put him in the hospital so I gotta go check on him, make sure he's OK,\" Adams said.\nYou can't say that stuff and then be mad that people ran with a story. You can't claim \"fake news\" when you're the one propagating a story.\nAnyway, here's hoping that Pat the Patriot is fine and healthy and ready to go for the Super Bowl and no one is in the hospital for being blindsided at the Pro Bowl by a much bigger human and that Adams can now spend his free time focusing in on tackling people who deserve to be tackled.\nIf you still haven't marked your calendar for the Super Bowl, the game will be kicking off from Atlanta on Feb. 3 and will be televised by CBS and you can stream it right here. If you're thinking about buying a new TV for the big game, CNET has you covered. They shared their best picks for every budget.",
    "https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/astros-vs-indians-final-score-bregman-homers-kluber-struggles-plus-takeaways-from-houstons-alds-game-1-win/": "Friday afternoon, four days after the end of the regular season, the Houston Astros and Cleveland Indians finally opened their ALDS matchup at Minute Maid Park.\nThe defending World Series champion Astros started their title defense with a tidy 7-2 win (box score) over the Indians in Game 1. They hit four home runs in the win and now lead the best-of-five series 1-0. Game 2 will be played Saturday afternoon.\nHere's what you need to know about the Astros win in Game 1 of the ALDS.\nBregman broke the ice\nAstros third baseman Alex Bregman put together an MVP-caliber regular season in which he racked up 51 doubles and 31 home runs. He finished third in MLB in extra-base hits (83) and tenth in total bases (316). Bregman did that despite hitting only one home run in his final 18 regular season games.\nIn ALDS Game 1 on Friday, Bregman opened the scoring with a fourth inning solo home run into the Crawford Boxes in left field. It was his first home run at Minute Maid Park since Sept. 5.\nThat was the Bregman's fifth career postseason home run and he's hit them all five against brand names: Corey Kluber, Clayton Kershaw, Kenley Jansen, and Chris Sale (two).\nBregman's homer not only provided the first run of the series, it was the first hit of the series. Justin Verlander and Kluber had each thrown three hitless innings up to that point. The Astros added a second run in the fourth inning on Josh Reddick's two-out single.\nKluber's postseason HR trouble resurfaced\nIn his last four postseason starts, Kluber has now allowed 17 runs and nine home runs in 15 innings. That dates back to Game 7 of the 2016 World Series. The Astros worked him hard for four runs in 4 2/3 innings in ALDS Game 1 on Friday, including three more home runs.\nCorey Kluber TB \u2022 SP \u2022 28 2018 ALDS Game 1 vs. Astros IP 4 2/3 H 6 R 4 ER 4 BB 2 K 2 HR 3 View Profile\nKluber sailed through the first three innings on 33 pitches before running into trouble in the fourth, when the Astros forced him to throw 35 pitches en route to scoring two runs. Kluber threw 87 total pitches in Game 1 and generated only eight swings and misses. That is very un-Kluber-like. Only six times in 33 regular season starts did he get fewer swings and misses.\nMore than anything, Kluber seemed to battle imperfect control Friday, which contributed to two hit-by-pitches in the second inning after three hit-by-pitches total during the regular season. Two walks and two hit batsmen gave the Astros four free baserunners. Never once in his 33 regular season starts did Kluber give a team more than three free baserunners.\nVerlander pitched very well ...\n... but he couldn't get through six innings. Give the Indians credit, they really made Verlander work despite not recording their first base hit until Yan Gomes capped a nine-pitch at-bat with a leadoff single to right in the sixth inning.\nThree batters later, Verlander was out of the game and the bases were loaded. He retired 15 of the first 16 batters he faced and only one of the final four batters he faced. The Indians went single, strikeout on a borderline pitch, single, walk in the sixth inning to push Verlander out of the game at 102 pitches.\nJustin Verlander HOU \u2022 SP \u2022 35 2018 ALDS Game 1 vs. Indians IP 5 1/3 H 2 R 2 ER 2 BB 2 K 7 View Profile\nRyan Pressly, Houston's stud bullpen pickup at the trade deadline, inherited the bases loaded with one out and allowed two runs on a wild pitch and a fielder's choice ground ball to first base. Both runs were charged to Verlander.\nThe Indians sent 20 men to the plate against Verlander and 15 of the 20 saw at least four pitches. Part of that is the strikeouts, sure, but Cleveland did not give Verlander any quick at-bats. Even when those long at-bats resulted in outs, they still helped drive the pitch count up. Getting Verlander out in the sixth inning isn't easy.\nHouston's bullpen was nails\nBecause of what happened with Ken Giles last postseason and early this season, a narrative has persisted that the Astros have a shaky bullpen. That couldn't be further from the truth. Houston's bullpen posted a 3.03 ERA during the regular season, the best in baseball, and they were among the league leaders in pretty much every meaningful bullpen category. Also, there's this:\nTwo Astros relievers (Pressly, Lance McCullers Jr., Roberto Osuna) combined to retire 11 of 12 batters faced in Game 1 after Verlander was given the hook. Pressly did allow two inherited runners to score on a wild pitch and a fielder's choice, but, when you're up 4-0, limiting the damage to two runs when the opposing team had the bases loaded with one out isn't a bad outcome.\nPressly retired the five batters he faced (two strikeouts) before giving way to McCullers, who went 1-2-3 in the eighth. Osuna pitched around a leadoff single in the ninth to close out the Game 1 win. The Astros can throw power arm after power arm at you. The Indians had three hits and five total baserunners in the game, and six times in their nine offensive innings they went down 1-2-3. Ouch.\nSpringer has gone deep in five straight postseason games\nFor only the fifth time in history, a player has gone deep in five consecutive postseason games. That player: George Springer. He hit a home run in each of Games 4-7 of the 2017 World Series before hitting a home run in Game 1 of the 2018 ALDS. He hit back-to-back jacks with Jose Altuve in the fifth inning Friday.\nSpringer and former Astro Carlos Beltran are tied the second longest home run streaks in postseason history at five games. Daniel Murphy holds the record. He went deep in six straight postseason games spanning the 2015 NLDS and 2015 NLCS.\nAll told, the Astros hit four home runs in Game 1 on Friday (Bregman, Springer, Altuve, Martin Maldonado). Believe it or not, Houston has hit at least four home runs in seven postseason games in franchise history. Only the Yankees (13) have more. The Astros have played 81 postseason games all-time. The Yankees have played 333 postseason games.\nThe Astros have an edge going forward\nHistorically, when a team wins Game 1 of a best-of-five postseason series at home, they've gone on to win the series 72.3 percent of the time. That's where the Astros are right now. They won Game 1 at home. The Indians need to win three of their next four games to advance to the ALCS now. Houston hasn't lost three times in a four-game span since August 28-31.\nLDS games will air on FS1, TBS and MLB Network. Games on TBS and FS1 can be streamed on fuboTV (Try for free).

    "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-injury-update-warriors-star-reportedly-out-for-game-2-vs-trail-blazers/": "The Golden State Warriors will be without Kevin Durant for at least one more game.\nAccording to Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports, Durant has been ruled out of Game 2 of the Western Conference Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers, which tips off at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday. Durant didn't suit up for Game 1 of the series, after missing Game 6 against the Houston Rockets.\nDuring Game 5 of the Warriors' second-round series with the Rockets, Durant suffered a calf strain that knocked him out of the game. The way he planted and immediately grabbed the back of his leg had many worried that he suffered an Achilles injury, but the Warriors got good news that it was a calf injury instead.\nStill, while Durant didn't suffer a career-altering injury, this calf strain is going to leave the Warriors shorthanded for a bit. Even with Durant out of the lineup for Game 1, the Warriors didn't miss a beat as they came away with a 116-94 victory. Golden State still is a formidable squad with Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green leading the way.\nWith Durant out, the Warriors will need Curry and Thompson to step up like they did in Game 1 against Portland. The Splash Brothers have been inconsistent throughout the postseason, but absolutely excelled on Tuesday as they combined to score 62 points. Curry scored 36 points and knocked down nine threes.\nThere's also the chance DeMarcus Cousins returns from his quad injury in the playoffs, and potentially this series, which would only help the Warriors.\nThe Warriors should still be considered the favorites in this series even with Durant out for the first few games, but it will be fascinating to see if the Blazers can bounce back in Game 2.",
    "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/wnba-power-rankings-dallas-wings-fire-coach-after-reported-postgame-altercation-with-team-ceo/": "OK, originally this was going to be about the Atlanta Dream and how they would move on from the season-ending injury to Angel McCoughtry, their lone All-Star and best player. But honestly, the Dream have looked fine so far, winning all three games without her, and are likely to still get a top-two seed and a bye into the semifinals.\nInstead, let's talk about the Dallas Wings, because wow, what a mess. In the short WNBA season things can change wicked fast, and this Wings team is a prime example. Just a month ago they were flying high, having won seven of eight games to move to 14-9 on the season. Liz Cambage had set a new WNBA scoring record with 53 points, and with no clear-cut favorite they looked capable of making a deep playoff run.\nThey haven't won since.\nEight straight losses have sent them tumbling down the standings, where they're hanging onto the eighth and final playoff spot by just a thread. Oh, and they just fired their coach, Fred Williams, after he and team exec Gregg Bibb reportedly got into an altercation outside of the visitors lockerroom in D.C. on Sunday. Following the Wings' 93-80 loss to the Mystics, their eighth consecutive defeat, \"Williams and Bibb had to be restrained by other Wings staffers, and Williams was screaming obscenities,\" HighPostHoops.com reported.\nWith three games to play for each team, the Wings still hold a one-game lead over the Aces and own the tiebreaker between the two teams, so they do have the upper hand. Still, this is by no means over considering the two teams play each other once more, and the Wings also have road games with the Sun and Storm left.\nTaj McWilliams-Franklin is going to have her work cut out for her to turn this thing around quickly. Because assuming they still make the playoffs, it's going to be a quick turnaround with a single-elimination game staring them in the face.\nOn another note, it would be a mistake not to acknowledge the announcement that Lindsay Whalen is set to retire at the end of this season. Most assumed it was coming once she decided to become coach at the University of Minnesota, but now it is official. This is the last run for one of the greatest point guards the league has ever seen. There will be time in the future to look back on her remarkable career with the Connecticut Sun and Minnesota Lynx, the latter of whom she's led to four championships, but for now, let's just enjoy however many games a true legend has left.\n1. Seattle Storm (24-8) -- No movement\nIt was a busy week for the Storm, but another successful one, as they went 3-1 to move to 24-8 on the season. Already owning the second-best record in franchise history, Seattle's magic number for clinching the No. 1 seed is just one. That means just one Storm win or one Dream loss gets the Storm a bye to the semi-finals and homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs.\n2. Atlanta Dream (22-10) -- No movement\nAngel McCoughtry is unfortunately out for the season, but you wouldn't know it by looking at the Dream's last three outings. They've now won six in a row, including the last three without their All-Star and leading second-leading scorer. Which shows they're still going to be a problem heading into the playoffs -- especially with their stout defense.\n3. Washington Mystics (20-11) -- Up 1\nWell, well, well, look at the Mystics. After hitting a rough patch in the middle of July, Washington has bounced back with six straight wins to jump up into third place. Yes, one of those wins came by forfeit, but they also crushed the league-leading Storm by 23 on Thursday. This Mystics team just might be peaking at the perfect time.\n4. Connecticut Sun (18-13) -- Up 1\nThe Sun are still mostly back, having won six of their last seven games. But they did have a slip-up this week against the Sky, which led to some drama on the sidelines. The Sky's blatant pursuit of the single-game assist record in a blowout led to Sun coach Curt Miller fuming about the \"bush league\" tactics.\n5. Phoenix Mercury (18-14) -- Up 1\nThe Mercury have won consecutive games for the first time since late June, which is a good, obviously, and with the standings still quite jumbled, they're still in right there with a chance to snag a top-four seed. On the whole, they've still struggled without Sancho Lyttle, but Sunday's big win over the Sparks was an encouraging sign.\n6. Los Angeles Sparks (18-13) -- Down 3\nFor the first time since the WNBA went to their new playoff format, the Sparks will be forced to play a single-elimination game. Now, the only question is, will it be one or two? Due to their current two-game skid, which included a loss to the Dream on Thursday, the Sparks cannot catch Atlanta for the No. 2 seed. But there's still plenty to play for, as Candace Parker and Co. will want to avoid having to play two single-elimination games just to make the semi-finals.\n7. Minnesota Lynx (17-14) -- No movement\nThey're still the Lynx, and they still have Maya Moore and Sylvia Fowles, but the signs are not good. They've beaten just one playoff team since the early July, and the injury list is growing, with Danielle Robinson now looking unlikely to be ready for the postseason. Against the top teams -- such as on Sunday against the Storm -- they just look a bit overmatched.\n8. Dallas Wings (14-17) -- No movement\nWelp! (See above)\n9. Las Vegas Aces (13-18) -- No movement\nThanks to the Wings' absolute collapse over the last few weeks, the Aces are still alive in the playoff race. They're one game back of the Wings with three games to play, including a matchup Friday between the teams in Dallas. If the Aces can win that game, they really might have a chance of pulling this thing off considering the Wings' tough remaining schedule.\n10. Chicago Sky (11-20) -- No movement\nThe Sky became the third team eliminated from playoff contention with their loss to the Sun on Sunday. It's honestly surprising and a bit impressive they nearly made it to the final week before being officially eliminated, but that won't matter much to the team. Also, Courtney Vandersloot is still on pace to set single-season records for both assists per game and total assists.\n11. Indiana Fever (5-26) -- No movement\nThe Fever are pretty much just running out the clock here on another rough season. It's been nice to see Kelsey Mitchell's efficiency start to improve a bit here lately after a brutal July. She still hasn't been as good as she was early in the season, but things are at least moving in the right direction. Tiffany Mitchell has had some encouraging games lately as well.\n12. New York Liberty (7-23) -- No movement\nThe Liberty ended last season on a 10-game winning streak, and now they're in danger of doing the opposite to close out this campaign. They've lost nine in a row, with even Tina Charles' brilliance unable to lift them out of this rut.",

In a tight match that also saw a late penalty kick from Sevilla saved by Barca keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, it was Lionel Messi and company that took home another trophy ahead of La Liga starting next weekend.\nDembele scores gorgeous winner\nAfter Pablo Sarabia opened the scoring with a fine finish on nine minutes, Barca's Gerard Pique scored just before halftime on a saved Lionel Messi free kick to draw level. And with the Spanish Super Cup hanging in the balance, it was an unexpected talent who secured the win.\nOusmane Dembele, trying to show he has what it takes to be a consistent player for the team, fired home an outrageous shot 78 minutes in off the crossbar and in to seal the victory:\nA brick wall between Barca's posts\nA collision between ter Stegen and Aleix Vidal resulted in a penalty kick awarded in the final minutes of the match. Wissam Ben Yedder, in added time, went low and to the right of the frame, and so too did Ter Stegen, who made the game-clinching stop.\nPlayer of the match\nDembele. He was lively, confident and took his chance really well. Not many people thought he was going to take that shot, but he did just that and produced his most important goal for the club since arriving last year.\nMessi, the king\nMessi made history by becoming the most honored player at the club. With the Spanish Super Cup on Sunday, the Argentine superstar, who wore the captain's armband, clinched his 33rd trophy, which is more than any player in club history. Andre Iniesta, who now plays in Japan after moving to Vissel Kobe this summer, was tied with Messi at 32.\nWhat record does he not hold at the club? What a legend.\nWhat result means\nIt was a well-deserved result for Barcelona, which had almost 70 percent of the possession and put eight shots on frame, but the lack of clinical finishing kept Sevilla in it. It never really felt like Sevilla was much of a threat to win this one, and Barca put the game away late.\nBarca has some momentum entering La Liga, while Sevilla played valiantly but needs to figure out what the team will look like in attack. With Ben Yedder and the recently-added Andre Silva, there are options available with Luis Muriel, but finding a partnership duo that understands each other well will be key for this team against the physical defense of the Spanish league.",
    "https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/twitter-roasts-new-ole-miss-mascot-landshark-tony-a-good-idea-with-poor-execution/": "In what might mark the first time in history a Change.Org petition has paid off -- even indirectly -- Ole Miss unveiled \"Landshark Tony\" on Saturday. Tony, inspired by the Rebels' famous \"Fins Up\" celebration, came onto the scene with a Twitter account and a photo, and man is he ever a sight to see.\nThere's change, and then there's change.\nThis might be the first mascot to truly give the Pelicans a run for their money in terms of scary appearances and not in an intimidating way. Why is his eye squinting a little? Why are his eyes pitch black? And why oh why is his mask so detailed? His smile is insanely sinister.\nMascots needs a certain amount of whimsy. You don't need your land shark to be an anatomically correct shark. He looks like a rejected design from \"Street Sharks,\" and they were also horrifying.\nTwitter agrees with the sentiment.\nThe story behind Tony is actually pretty endearing. He's an homage to former Ole Miss linebacker Tony Fein, a veteran who served in Iraq and died in 2009. Fein wore the same No. 47 that Landshark Tony will wear. He's credited with starting the \"Fins Up\" celebration. The execution is just extremely questionable.\nTo be fair to Ole Miss, the SEC has a longstanding tradition of not knowing what they are mascot-wise. You can make an argument that sharks are rebels of the sea. The Black Bear was at least named Rebel, so there was a stretch of a connection there.\nOnly one word can really describe this unveiling: yikes.",

Saturday, the Longhorns will aim to keep the momentum rolling when they take on a foe who has been a thorn in their side in recent memory in Kansas State.\nWhile Texas is rolling at 3-1 on the year, Kansas State is 2-2, but the Wildcats have been outscored by 50 in their two losses against ranked opponents (Mississippi State and West Virginia). Coach Bill Snyder is clearly one of the game's best, but another loss here and it would absolutely be fair to wonder whether this team even makes a bowl.\nViewing information\nDate: Saturday, Sept. 29 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ET\nLocation: Bill Snyder Family Stadium -- Manhattan, Kansas\nTV: FS1 | Live stream: fuboTV (Try for free)\nStorylines\nTexas: Now that the Horns have won a few games, it's time to dissect what they can actually improve upon. The defense has turned a corner, but can the offense keep building consistency? Quarterback Sam Ehlinger is best when he's running and then hitting receivers Collin Johnson and Lil'Jordan Humphrey over the top. The problem is the offense is streaky in executing this. Can they fill in the gaps with the running game and have a better plan on third downs? Texas is seventh in the Big 12 with a 37.7 percent conversion rate.\nKansas State: The 'Cats sure could use a win to stop the bleeding, and who better than Texas? K-State is usually a much better team in the second half of the season, but this time it feels less certain. Snyder, in a rare moment of actual helplessness, exclaimed after a 35-6 loss at West Virginia, \"I can't coach a team that can't get six inches on a play.\" K-State's offense is discombobulated and brutally bad, and it can't rely on the grind-it-out approach like it has in years past.\nGame prediction, picks\nThis is a somewhat surprisingly difficult pick. History says go with Snyder as a home dog. However, Kansas State is a mess, and for the first time in a while, it genuinely feels like Snyder's back is against the wall. Still, history also says Texas coach Tom Herman is far better against the spread as an underdog. A lot of clashing trends here, but for the sake of making a pick, I'd sooner bet on Snyder in this situation than Herman.

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) came back from his June 30-July 5 trip to Russia with some new perspectives on the sanctions the U.S. imposed on Moscow after its annexation of Crimea and interference in the 2016 presidential election. \"We need to take a look at sanctions \u2014 are they actually changing Russia's behavior?\" he told Sirius XM Washington correspondent Olivier Knox on Friday. \"And right now, unfortunately, I don't think they're particularly working from that standpoint.\"\nThe eight-Republican delegation to St. Petersburg and Moscow \u2014 led by Sen. Richard Shelby (Ala.) and including Johnson, Rep. Kay Granger (Texas) and Sens. Steve Daines (Mont.), John Hoeven (N.D.), John Kennedy (La.), Jerry Moran (Kan.), and John Thune (S.D.) \u2014 met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian lawmakers, though not President Vladimir Putin. \"Members of the delegation set off on their trip late last week promising to be tough with Russian officials ahead of the president's visit, especially on matters of election interference,\" The Washington Post reported. \"But they struck a conciliatory tone once there,\" which \"played well in Moscow, but not on the home front.\"\nJohnson told The Washington Examiner that the GOP delegation did hammer the Russians on Moscow's meddling in the 2016 election, but the Russians \"would push back with all the ways we interfere in their politics in terms of funding NGOs, and Radio Free Europe and Voice of America,\" and \"nobody yielded.\" At the same time, he added, \"I've been pretty upfront that the election interference \u2014 as serious as that was, and unacceptable \u2014 is not the greatest threat to our democracy. ... We've blown it way out of proportion.\" Johnson also said some sanctions did have promise: \"My sense is that the targeted sanctions to the oligarchs, to the members of government, are the ones that really sting and probably [offer] the best chance of affecting their behavior.\"",

That said, are the laying too many points to the visiting Miami Heat at 6:00 p.m. ET on Monday?\nGame Snapshot\n521 Miami Heat at 522 Boston Celtics\n6:00 p.m. ET, Monday, January 21, 2019\nTD Garden, Boston, Massachusetts\nOur NBA Live Odds page pulls spreads and totals from multiple different online sportsbooks so you can compare betting odds to ensure you\u2019re getting the best line.\nPublic Betting Trends\nAccording to oddsmakers from online sportsbook BetNow.eu, the Celtics are 8-point favorites to beat the Heat. The total, meanwhile, sits at 215.5 points and as of this writing, 55% of the public betting tickets wagered at online sportsbooks are on the Celtics to cover the point spread.\nMiami Heat Fantasy Spin\nJosh Richardson (illness) scored a game-high 26 points Saturday vs. the Bulls, shooting 10-of-15 from the field and 2-of-2 from the foul line, with three rebounds, two assists and four 3-pointers in 30 minutes. There were questions regarding Richardson\u2019s status earlier Saturday, but he managed to play through illness and put forth one of his better scoring efforts of the season. The 26 points are the most that the fourth-year guard has scored in a game since early November, and he made four 3-pointers in a game for the third time this month. Richardson picked a good time to have an outing of this caliber, as he\u2019s shooting just 41.1% from the field and 32.4% from three in January.\nBoston Celtics Fantasy Spin\nJayson Tatum shot a respectable 7-of-13 from the field Saturday vs. the Hawks, finishing with 19 points (5-of-5 FTs), five rebounds, two assists, one steal and three blocks in 35 minutes. Like many of his teammates not named Kyrie Irving, Tatum was quiet offensively in the first half. The second-year wing was more productive in the second half, ultimately putting together a solid stat line that had a little bit of everything outside of three-pointers (he did not attempt one). A nice bounce back for a player who missed all six of his shot attempts Friday night, finishing with a season-low two points. Tatum\u2019s three blocked shots were one short of his high for the season to date.\nNBA Betting Trends\nMiami\nThe Heat are just 5-11-3 against the spread in their last 19 games following a win of more than 10 points.\nBoston\nThe Celtics have cashed in 17 of their last 21 home games versus an opponent with a winning road record.\nPrediction\nThe Heat have been a solid play in this series, covering in five of their last six meetings with the Celtics and posting a 5-2 ATS record in their last seven trips to Boston. The road team is also 6-2 against the number in the last eight meetings between these two teams while the underdog is a highly profitable 16-5 at the betting window in the last 21 meetings. While the Heat might not pull off the outright upset, they should stay within the 8 points.\nMonday NBA Prediction: Miami Heat +8",

    "https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/5/18/18630544/danny-roberts-expects-to-shut-down-showman-newcomer-michel-pereira-this-is-the-ufc": "Danny Roberts is looking to get back to his winning ways following a controversial hometown loss to Claudio Silva at UFC London when he takes on viral sensation and promotional newcomer, Michel Pereira, at UFC Rochester.\nRoberts was deemed to have verbally submitted to Silva as he attempted to negotiate his way out of an armbar, handing the victory to the Brazilian. Casting his mind back to the event, Roberts remarked that he had no idea that a verbal submission rule was in place and insisted that the referee did not mention anything about it prior to the contest.\n\u201cI only found out after the fight [about the verbal submission rule],\u201d Roberts told MMA Fighting.\n\u201cI was going back and forth with people on social media, I was hearing all different kinds of things from all different kinds of places. Even then, there were plenty of people debating if it was a rule or if it wasn\u2019t a rule. At the rules meeting before the fight, it wasn\u2019t something I was made aware of by the referee.\u201d\nUp until the Silva loss, Roberts had been in sensational form, seeing off Oliver Enkamp with a first round knockout before claiming a decision win over Polish stalwart, David Zawada. He insists the loss to Silva has brought no pause to his momentum.\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t slowed me down whatsoever. It was just a hard thing to digest at the time, but there was also a lot to take away from it. We got some time in against a slippery customer who competes on the world stage in jiu-jitsu, who hasn\u2019t been beat in 11 years. I felt like I was beating him for two rounds and then a mistake in the heat of the moment cost me the fight,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBetween the UFC and the fans, they know who I am; they know what I bring to the table. I come to fight and I always bring it. I really believe that I\u2019m up there with some of the best in the world and it\u2019s only a matter of time before an opportunity pops up for me to prove that.\u201d\nPereira has become one of the most viral entities outside of the major promotions due to his recent flashy performances with Road FC. Given the Brazilian\u2019s fighting style, Roberts believes he can dominate the proceedings.\n\u201cWith this kid that I\u2019m fighting, he likes to do flashy things, he\u2019s a bit of showman and I think that will make for an exciting matchup,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI\u2019m a guy that takes the fight game very seriously and I\u2019m going to have a guy across from me that\u2019s going to try and show a lot of flair and diversity in his striking. Honestly, I think it\u2019s going to be one-sided, I think I\u2019m going to shut him down quick.\u201d\nAfter studying tape on his opponent, \u201cHot Chocolate\u201d is confident that he can avoid ending up on the end of a spectacular knockout, which has become Pereira\u2019s calling card.\n\u201cThe guy has had 11 fights in the last two years, so there is plenty of tape on him and we\u2019ve seen a lot of patterns and setups from him that are exactly the same,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cSaying that, a fight is a fight, when you get in there and the lights are on a lot of things can change, but we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ve seen a lot of repetition in this guy throughout his last few fights.\u201d\nRoberts believes Pereira\u2019s need to play to the crowd will be his undoing. He also underlined his belief that the Brazilian is taking a big step up in terms of opposition.\n\u201cThis is the UFC; he\u2019s in the big leagues now. This is the one percent and I truly feel I\u2019m part of the one percent; I feel like I was born to be in the one percent. He needs to come out and prove that he belongs here, because I already know this is where I\u2019m supposed to be. I don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s any pressure on me whatsoever, he\u2019s the one that\u2019s got to do something, not me,\u201d Roberts said.\n\u201cLooking at him, who he is and what he does, there will be a lot of eyes on this fight. I don\u2019t expect that to change, I think his fighting style is part of the reason he\u2019s got to where he is. People are going to expect that flair and showmanship, but I\u2019ll be walking forward, ready for a war.\u201d\nPushed for prediction, Roberts forecast that the fight wouldn\u2019t make it to the third round.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see it going passed the second round,\u201d stated Roberts. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to hit the floor too much, and again, I really can\u2019t see this one going the full 15 minutes.\u201d\nDanny Roberts is an ambassador of leading mouthguard provider, OPRO.

The fetus had a brain condition \"incompatible with life,\" but Zirlott was unable to obtain a late-term abortion because her own life was not directly in danger.\nHer daughter Zoe was born severely disabled, and died one year later after \"constant\" suffering. Zirlott says she would have had an abortion to prevent that suffering.\n\"I would have sacrificed myself if it meant she could have suffered one less day.\"\nOn Wednesday, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed a bill to ban virtually all abortions in the state, unless the mother's life is in danger. As passed, the law would take effect in six months.\nWhen pressed during the bill's debate on what would happen to a victim of incest, Republican State Sen. Clyde Chambliss said his hope is \"that all young ladies would be educated by their parents, their guardians that should a situation like this occur, you need to go get help \u2014 you need to do it immediately.\"\nProtesters against the anti-abortion bill, dressed as handmaids, at the Alabama State House in Montgomery, Ala, last month. (Mickey Welsh/Montgomery Advertiser/AP)\nZirlott said his comments show \"an abysmal lack of knowledge about the nature of trauma for so many victims of assault.\"\n\"It effectively takes away your voice,\" she said. \"The silence inserts itself into you and you can't always reach out and ask for help.\"\n\"It's just complete wilful ignorance on their behalf, to imagine that this bill helps those victims at all,\" she said.\nRoe vs. Wade was 'an abomination'\nThe legislation that came from Roe vs. Wade is 'an abomination,' said Rick Renshaw, the political director for the The Alliance for a Pro-Life Alabama. (Submitted by Rick Renshaw)\nSupporters of the legislation say it is intentionally designed to conflict with the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationally, because they hope to spark a court case that might prompt the justices to revisit abortion rights.\n\"It was a terrible law when it was passed, it's a terrible law now. It's an abomination,\" said Rick Renshaw, the political director for the Alliance for a Pro-Life Alabama, a coalition of groups opposed to abortion in the state.\nThe new legislation \"protects the sanctity of unborn life,\" he said.\nHe argued that many people in Alabama were \"elated\" that the bill had been signed, and that years of work had \"finally come to fruition.\"\n\"This is in a sense righting something that's been wrong for a long, long time.\"\nZirlott said that politicians and pro-life activists like Renshaw don't understand the grief and trauma that can come with pregnancy resulting from assault.\n\"[Renshaw] was not there for those nights I spent watching Zoe slowly suffer and die for a year in front of me,\" she said.\n\"The politicians who have passed this law can't even begin to comprehend the circumstances that we're coming to seek care under.\"\nAnti-abortion marchers rally at the Supreme Court during the 46th annual March for Life in Washington in January. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\nWave of state bills\nLauren Rankin, a writer and pro-choice activist, said that several other states are also pursuing abortion restrictions, with bills \"designed to challenge Roe vs. Wade, and have the Supreme Court eventually overturn it.\"\nShe explained that \"with Brett Kavanaugh's appointment in the fall \u2026 the balance of power really shifted, and so now we have a 5-4 split in favour of conservative anti-abortion policies.\"\nShe told Tremonti that pro-choice activists are fighting the bills in court, but are worried that the Supreme Court \"will use Alabama's total law, as sort of a straw man to say, 'This is too severe, we won't support that but we would support a six-week ban.'\"\n\"Even if they don't actually overturn Roe vs. Wade, it is undeniable that this Supreme Court will allow seemingly more benign but more pernicious restrictions on abortion ... that will render legal abortion meaningless for millions of people.\"\nClick 'listen' near the top of this page to hear the full conversation.\nWritten by Padraig Moran, with files from the Associated Press.

Robertson and other winners.\nKeep reading to learn more about each of the 2018 English-language winners.\nThe Red Word is Sarah Henstra's first work of adult fiction. (Grove Press, ECW Press)\nSarah Henstra's novel The Red Word follows Karen, a college sophomore whose closest friends and roommates \u2014 a group of strong-willed intellectual feminists \u2014 are at odds with her fraternity brother boyfriend. Karen loves the cerebral debates she has at home with her roommates, as well as the raucous parties at her boyfriend's fraternity house. Caught up in both worlds, Karen inadvertently becomes part of her roommates's elaborate plan to expose rape culture at the fraternity and is haunted by the outcome.\n\"Groundbreaking and provocative, this is an astonishing evisceration of the clich\u00e9s of sexual politics as they exist not only on our college campuses, but also within broader present-day society. Alternately heartbreaking, funny, and critical, no one gets off easily. The Red Word plumbs the depths of literature, mythology, history, philosophy, and a host of contemporary issues \u2014 an utterly effing good read,\" said jurors Andrea MacPherson, Shani Mootoo and Craig Francis Power in a press release.\nDarrel McLeod is the author of Mamaskatch. (Ilja Herb, Douglas & McIntyre)\nDarrel McLeod's Mamaskatch is a memoir of his chaotic childhood and coming-of-age, mostly spent in the care of his fierce Cree mother, Bertha. McLeod describes vivid memories of moose stew and wild peppermint tea, surrounded by siblings, cousins, aunts and uncles. Though he experienced racism and abuse from non-Indigenous teachers, students and caregivers, McLeod learned from his mother, a residential school survivor, to be proud of his heritage.\n\"Mamaskatch: A Cree Coming of Age dares to immerse readers in provocative contemporary issues including gender fluidity, familial violence, and transcultural hybridity. A fast-moving, intimate memoir of dreams and nightmares \u2014 lyrical and gritty, raw and vulnerable, told without pity, but with phoenix-like strength,\" said the jury members, Ted Bishop, Leslie Shimotakahara and Merrily Weisbord, in a press release.\nCecily Nicholson is an award-winning poet from Vancouver, B.C. (Liam Britten/CBC/Talonbooks)\nCecily Nicholson takes a researched look at the landscape of the African diaspora in this poetic account of economy travel on Canadian and U.S. roadways. Crossing bridges and passing through tunnels in the Great Lakes region and beyond, Nicholson explores how migration, trauma and her own family history were shaped by transportation infrastructure and geography.\n\"In this hypnotic suite of long poems, Cecily Nicholson makes room, offering glimpses and echoes of the Canadian landscape as she explores ideas of borders, identity, industry and travel. She offers a catalogue of impressions, a collage of the ephemeral, held together by image and the pulsing phrase that stays with you long after the journey's over,\" said the jury, Garry Gottfriedson, Sachiko Murakami and Patrick Warner, in a press release.\nYoung people's literature \u2014 text: Sweep by Jonathan Auxier\nJonathan Auxier is the author of Sweep. (Puffin Canada)\nSet in Victorian London, Sweep revolves around a young orphan girl named Nan who sweeps chimneys for a dangerous and hardscrabble living. Nan nearly perishes in a deadly chimney fire, but is saved when a piece of charcoal comes to life as a mysterious golem-like creature. Together, the two hatch a plan to rescue young orphan chimney sweeps from losing their lives on the job for cruel masters.\n\"A tender story of what makes us human, Sweep doesn't shy away from the risks of love and monstrousness of indifference. With an impeccable narrative, Sweep shows how love can breathe life into darkness and how hope can spark change. Auxier weaves a multi-layered masterpiece with endearing characters and gut-wrenching twists that are certain to instill readers with a sense of wonder and discovery for the miracle of storytelling,\" said the jury, Shelley Hrdlitschka, Philip Roy and Sarah Tsiang, in a press release.\nYoung people's literature \u2014 illustrated books: They Say Blue by Jillian Tamaki\nThey Say Blue is Jillian Tamaki's first picture book.

In 2014, Tamaki won a Governor General's Literary Award for her work illustrating the graphic novel This One Summer, which was written by her cousin, Mariko Tamaki.\n\"They Say Blue is a wonderful blend of words and art, a sweeping, joyous book from cover to cover. Its lively and dynamic compositions are sure to captivate both children and those who love to read to children. Wonderfully uplifting and imaginative, it spans an entire range of emotions and colours and makes one's heart sing,\" said the jury, Adwoa Badoe, Renata Liwska and Hugh MacDonald, in a press release.\nTranslated literature: Descent into Night, translated by Phyllis Aronoff & Howard Scott from the original French by Edem Awumey\nDescent into Night was translated by Phyllis Aronoff and Howard Scott. (Talonbooks/Mawenzi)\nDescent into Night follows a playwright named Ito Baraka who, in his final days, furiously documents the hardships that have shaped him. In his native land, an unnamed West African country, Baraka was imprisoned in a camp and tortured for distributing leaflets with Samuel Beckett quotes. He owes his life to his cellmate, an old wise teacher named Koli Lem, with whom he shared a love for literature. The original French edition by Edem Awumey, Explication de la nuit, received rave reviews from literary critics.\n\"Descent into Night, translated by Phyllis Aronoff and Howard Scott, is a beautifully assured rendering of a text offering many translation challenges. The translators agilely follow the text as it shifts between an ailing Quebec writer's regrets about his life, and his long-ago involvement in a failed West African revolution, which haunts him into the present. This translation skillfully captures the lyricism of the French text,\" said the jury, Dawn M. Cornelio, Peter Feldstein and Kathryn Gabinet-Kroo, in a press release.\nBotticelli in the Fire & Sunday in Sodom is a collection of two plays written by playwright, author and theatre director Jordan Tannahill. (Alejandro Santiago/Playwrights Canada Press)\nPlaywright Jordan Tannahill revisits and reframes the historic and the mythic with Botticelli in the Fire & Sunday in Sodom. The work visits famed artist Sandro Botticelli as he paints the masterpiece that is The Birth of Venus to examine the sexual and political politics that were at play. In Sunday in Sodom, Tannahill places the Biblical destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in the present day, looking at Lot's wife and what transpired during that fateful event. Tannahill previously won the Governor General's Literary Award in 2014 for Age of Minority: Three Solo Plays.\n\"Jordan Tannahill's two-play volume explores the fragility of social consensus in a world made uneasy by the forces of social division. Both plays are poetic, irreverent and funny, offering the pleasure of entertainment while displaying masterful literary ability. Tannahill possesses a powerful artistic voice that reflects where we come from, who we are and who we may become,\" said jurors, Rosa Laborde, Ian Ross and Kent Stetson, in a press release.",

    "https://mlb.nbcsports.com/2019/04/05/video-jorge-polanco-hits-for-the-cycle/": "Not a month into the new season, and we\u2019ve already seen the first cycle of 2019. Shortstop Jorge Polanco completed the feat for the Twins on Friday, becoming the first franchise player to do so since Michael Cuddyer in 2009 and the first major-leaguer to hit for the cycle since Brock Holt completed one for the Red Sox during Game 3 of the 2018 American League Division Series.\nPolanco started off with the most difficult part of a cycle \u2014 a triple \u2014 after getting a three-bagger off of the Phillies\u2019 Nick Pivetta in the first inning. When he came up to bat again in the third inning, he roped a single to center field for his second hit of the night, but was left stranded on the bases after Pivetta made short work of the heart of the order. The Twins, meanwhile, trailed 5-2 after the Phillies\u2019 explosive run in the first inning, and had only just gotten on the board with Max Kepler\u2018s two-run homer in the third.\nNevertheless, Polanco continued to charge toward his first career cycle, this time with a 349-foot home run off of Pivetta in the fifth inning. He pounced on a first-pitch, 90.6-m.p.h. fastball and sent it out to the right field corner, barely clearing the wall for his first long ball of the 2019 season.\nThe Phillies pulled Pivetta after five innings of four-run, four-strikeout ball, but Polanco still had something left in the tank for Pivetta\u2019s replacement, lefty reliever Adam Morgan. With only a double left to collect, Polanco stepped into the batter\u2019s box at the top of the seventh inning, worked a 1-1 count against Morgan, and bounced an 81.2-m.p.h. changeup down the third base line. The ball ricocheted into the left field corner, Andrew McCutchen ran to retrieve it, and Polanco was left standing on second base with the first complete cycle of the year.\nThe Twins currently trail the Phillies 10-4 in the bottom of the eighth.\nUpdate: Polanco added to his total with a fifth base hit in the ninth inning. Per MLB.com\u2019s Andrew Simon, he\u2019s the first known player to reach 11+ total bases without scoring (or driving in) multiple runs.",
    "https://electrek.co/2019/05/17/mercedes-benz-eqc-review-electric-suv-first-drive/": "Mercedes-Benz is launching its new EQC electric SUV and they invited us to Norway to test drive it for the first time.\nHere are my impressions of the German automaker\u2019s first next-gen electric vehicle.\nMercedes-Benz EQC Specs\nWhile Mercedes-Benz did have other all-electric vehicles in the past, like the B-Class Electric, the EQC is in many ways the first true all-electric Mercedes-Benz vehicle.\nIt\u2019s not a converted gasoline car to make a compliance vehicle. It\u2019s a real effort from Mercedes to build an electric car from the ground up.\nThough to be fair, it\u2019s built on the same production line has the GLC SUV and it shares some of its parts.\nThey developed a skateboard-like platform with the battery in the middle and dual motor, one on each axle, which has become the standard in the industry.\nThe battery pack is where things get interesting. Mercedes-Benz is listing it as having a capacity of 80 kWh, but that\u2019s the usable energy capacity.\nMost automakers are listing the energy capacity of the battery pack as the full potential capacity, but not Mercedes-Benz.\nThey didn\u2019t even want to give us the full energy capacity.\nBased on the WLTP cycle, the electric SUV has a range of 259 miles (417 km). It\u2019s the same as the Audi e-tron electric SUV, which has a 95 kWh battery pack with 83.6 kWh of usable capacity.\nThe e-tron is a slightly larger vehicle, which could explain them having the same range with slightly different usable energy capacity.\nHowever, in my own experience with the EQC, it\u2019s getting closer to 200 miles on a single charge.\nThe battery pack is powered by 2 asynchronous motors with a total capacity of 300 kW (408 hp). It can achieve a top speed of 180 km/h (111 mph) and an acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 5.1 seconds.\nAccording to the spec sheet, the EQC is equipped with a water-cooled onboard charger with a capacity of 7.4 kW and has a maximum capacity of \u201cup to 110 kW at an appropriate charging station.\u201c\nI tested out the fast-charging capacity at a 150+ kW Ionity charging station during our trip in Norway.\nI couldn\u2019t get more than 87 kW out of the vehicle, but I still arrived at the station with about 40% state-of-charge.\nPresumably, it could achieve a 110 kW charge rate if you start charging from a lower state-of-charge.\nFor the last 50%, it looks like it can take up to 40 minutes to obtain a full charge, but most people would charge from 10-20% to around 80%.\nMercedes-Benz EQC Design\nAs for the design, the form factor is very similar to the GLC. You can tell that it\u2019s a Mercedes-Benz SUV at first glance.\nIt\u2019s with the front fascia and the wheels that Mercedes-Benz was able to be a little more creative and release design features specific to the tact that the vehicle is electric.\nThey have designed several different fascias with different faux grilles that customers can choose from:\nEven electric vehicles don\u2019t require as much air intake in the front for cooling purposes, most automakers aside from Tesla have found it hard to move away from the tradtional grille design.\nIn the case of the EQC, it actually does have some small air intakes in the grille that are activated only when needed. Most of what we see is a fake grille.\nAs far as fake grilles go, I think they have some cool designs here. I especially like the first one (107).\nMercedes-Benz also designed some new wheels for the EQC:\nThey are also mostly covered in order to optimize aerodynamic performance and help increase efficiency.\nMercedes-Benz EQC Driving Impressions\nMercedes-Benz owners would find a familiar environment when getting inside the EQC.\nThe user experience is extremely similar to any modern Mercedes-Benz and you find the same premium interior that the German automaker is known for.\nFor most people, the first new experience will happen when pressing the start button and the only feedback you get is from the displays. No roar of an engine.\nThis silence is extended through the entire driving experience. The Mercedes-Benz EQC s extremely quiet even by electric vehicle standard.\nThe automaker decoupled the front motor twice from the platform to limit its noise and vibration. As forthe back motor, it\u2019s much further away from the driver, but they also put a cover on it.\nWhen combined with a well-isolated cabin and the build quality that Mercedes-Benz is known for, it resulted in an exceptionally quiet driving experience.\nThe heads-up display is going to be one of the first things drivers are going to notice.\nAs far as HUDs go, it\u2019s one of the best ones I have used. The darker projection around the information is not too distracting.\nThe speedometer and the speed limit warnings are quite useful because the EQC is extremely smooth and you don\u2019t always feel how fast you are going.\nAs for the regenerative braking, there are so many different modes, which can be selected through paddles on the steering wheel, that there\u2019s almost something for everyone.\nD Auto (recuperation via ECO Assist to suit the situation)\nD + (coasting)\nD (low recuperation)\nD \u2013 (medium recuperation)\nD \u2013 \u2013 (high recuperation) This makes one-pedal driving possible, because in most situations the recuperative deceleration is enough not to require operation of the brake pedal.\nMercedes-Benz calls the highest level \u201cone-pedal driving\u201d, but that\u2019s not exactly true. There\u2019s no option to remove creep and while you can almost come to a stop on \u2018D \u2013 -\u2018, you need to press the brake for the complete stop.\nThe automaker also offers a lot of different driving modes\nCOMFORT: Default setting; accelerator pedal characteristic supports a comfortable driving style, but also automatically becomes more dynamic depending on the driving style.\nDefault setting; accelerator pedal characteristic supports a comfortable driving style, but also automatically becomes more dynamic depending on the driving style. ECO: Driving program focused on high efficiency and low consumption.\nDriving program focused on high efficiency and low consumption. MAX RANGE: Intelligent driving program that can help the driver achieve the maximum possible range.\nIntelligent driving program that can help the driver achieve the maximum possible range. SPORT: Driving program focused on the best response for the highest driving performance.\nDriving program focused on the best response for the highest driving performance. INDIVIDUAL: There is also an individual driving program which allows the various parameters to be adjusted separately.\nI didn\u2019t have enough time with the car to set an individual driving program, but I think that could be interesting.\nMy time on Sport mode was fun with a very dynamic pedal response. Comfort, which is the default setting, is perfect for driving in traffic or on the highway.\nMax Range creates a hard pressure point in the accelerator that limits the top speed to the speed limit unless you override it through a very hard press.\nIt was frustrating to use and I couldn\u2019t handle it for more than 10 minutes. I think it should only be used as a last resort if you think you are going to be short on range.\nMercedes-Benz EQC First Thoughts\nAfter my short time with the EQC, I mostly came out impressed by Mercedes-Benz\u2019s first real entry in the all-electric vehicle space.\nIt\u2019s going to have some decent competition in the space with a few other premium all-electric SUVs coming to market around the same time.\nThe EQC is a little smaller with less cargo space than the competition, like the Audi e-tron.\nI think it will have a tough time competing, but for Mercedes-Benz fans who are looking to go electric, it will be the smoothest transition for them.\nThe electric SUV is not extremely efficient and with a limited 80 kWh usable battery capacity, its range might be short for some people even though 200+ miles of range is more than enough for the vast majority of car buyers.\nI suppose a lot will depend on the price, which hasn\u2019t been announced yet.\nIf Mercedes-Benz can keep it under $70,000 before incentives, it could still be an interesting option, but I would need to spend more time with the car.\nThe Mercedes-Benz EQC is coming to Europe starting next month and it should arrive in the US early next year.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

When thinking about who the Falcons would draft, one question continued to pop into my head: WHO AND WHAT ARE THE ATLANTA FALCONS?! Seriously! I can\u2019t understand that franchise one bit, specifically in recent years! What I do know about them is that Doug Pederson has a major stake in that franchise after owning them for 3 STRAIGHT YEARS(INCLUDING PLAYOFFS). Just take a look at them under Dan Quinn. They were 8-8, suffered a crushing loss the SB, lost in the Divisional round, and went 7-9 this year. Seems Successful. On paper you have a great team with a Star(Above Average) QB, Franchise RB, 2 Great OL(Jake Matthews and Alex Mack), Julio \u201cFREAKING\u201d Jones, bunch of other good receivers, Adequate D-Line, Deion Jones and Co, Desmond Trufant, Keanu Neal and Ricardo Allen, and a Defensive Minded Head Coach to elevate the defense!!! That is one heck of a team with loads of star power! Where are the championships? What happened last year? Is Dan Quinn the answer? The Falcons had all the talent to be the NFC champion the past 4 seasons! This years draft and season will be defining for the Falcons. Contracts are expiring and the team is getting older. Tick Tock!\nLast year, the Falcons were 7-9. They had some major injuries at RB, Offensive Line, LB, Safety, and kicker. Looking at what happened in free agency, they lost Tevin Coleman, starting corners Robert Alford and Brian Poole, Bruce Irvin, some members along their offensive line, and franchise kicker Matt Bryant. They also did not make a major splash in free agency signings. They signed Offensive Lineman James Carpenter from the Jets(Biggest Signing), some other Offensive Lineman, Luke Stocker(Blocking TE from Tennessee), and SUPER BOWL 52 Victor Kenjon Barner. Their current major needs are Offensive Line(Right Tackle and Guard), Defensive Line, and Cornerback. With the Offensive trend in Free Agency, it seems to be gearing up for a heavy defensive draft for the Falcons. Ok, I finished my Falcon rant. Let\u2019s dive into the draft and the pick!\nInside the Draft Room\nIn order to get an understanding of my mindset when choosing the Pick, I\u2019ll going to relay to you how the selection of Rashan Gary happened through an EXCLUSIVE, exaggerated, Dave Spadaro-ish, inside the BGN mock Draft War room point of view.\n\u201cIt was late at night. Picks in the BGN Mock draft were flying off the board. I studied and went through many scenarios of who could be left on the board, when the Falcons were on the clock. A loud moan was heard when Jawaan Taylor, a premiere Tackle of the future, went off the board. All focus stayed on our board wondering what was to come next. Gasps came at pick 9 as the Lions selected Ed Oliver, another Highly rated player on my board. It was Nail Biting time! Who is going to be there when I pick? Is there going to be a highly rated player or will I have to reach?! The Dolphins finally selected and the long wait was over. I was now on the clock. A great player had fell in the draft and I had all intentions of stopping that slide and snatching him up. I waited with anticipation and came to a final conclusion. With the 14th pick in the 2019 BGN Mock Draft, the Atlanta Falcons select Rashan Gary, DL, Michigan.\u201d\nRashan Gary (Measurables and Production/High Recruit)\nIn seeing what all the mock drafts and draft analysts have circulating around, I saw Rashan Gary\u2019s name frequently in the top 10. I was not totally familiar with him so I took a look at some tapes/highlights and there is A LOT to like! Some great Offensive Linemen and Defensive Players were taken before my pick in this BGN Mock draft, but I feel I went BPA(Best Player Available). I love Rashan Gary and was so happy he fell to the Falcons\u2019 pick. To my naked eye he is a BEAST. A big, powerful, and speedy Defensive Line prospect. Gary was the best recruit coming out of high school in 2016. He can play both Defensive End and Defensive Tackle. I also believe he could fit in a 3-4 or a 4-3 defense. He is a dream prospect for defensive coach and Dan Quinn would be all over him. More details about Gary below:\nRashan Gary Obligatory Spider Graph Picture via Mockdraftable:\nExplosive - His best weapon as a pass rusher is his powerful first step. Erupts off the ball and has the speed and power to get around the best Offensive Tackles.\nBest Pass Rush technique- Analysts say \u201cSpeed-to-power is his go-to move. He Bull-rushes and uses his long-arms to knock his opponent off-balance.\u201d\nMore moves- Needs to add more pass rush moves to his repertoire, but is effective.\nRun Defense - This dude is a great run stuffer. He is huge, fast, and tackles well. He uses his unique power to push off centers and guards and knock down some RBs.\nHitting the Hole- He could learn to find gaps more quickly. Sometimes he gets into trouble reading the wrong hole, in situations where he could have gotten the tackle.\nTackling - One of the Best tacklers in the Draft. Able to get his hands on an opponent and throw them to the ground. Also great at \u201csafely\u201d laying the wood on opposing QBs. Don\u2019t want to get a Roughing the Passer flag these days!\nNatural Position DE or DT- Gary has the ability to play all around the D-Line and in any scheme with great power, tackling, and speed. I would play him at Defensive End where he has a chance to be most productive and move him inside on any down to rush or stop the run. He can be on the field from Day 1, but may need more crafting to be a full-time starter.\nEffort- Gary is an emotional player. His power is dictated by emotions. Some take this to mean he takes off on some plays, but I don\u2019t see it. I would go as far to say the guy has a high powered motor who can go up against the best Offensive tackles with a chance for disruption all game.\nAthleticism - Elite size, power and speed. Tested terrific for an edge defender except for his average 3-cone. Had a speedy 4.59, 40 yard dash at 277 pounds. Some may want him to add to his frame to play interior defensive line or add more muscle to become even better on the edge.\nMy Comparison and Sack Numbers\nMy player comp for Gary is Michael Bennett. The guy has tremendous power and great hands. He is going to be a major problem for Offensive Lines throughout the league. His run stuffing/tackling ability is also very strong. Michael Bennett\u2019s best attributes are elite power and good run stuffing, same attributes as Gary. Where they differ, is in terms of sack numbers. Gary was moved around the D-Line during his time at Michigan playing multiple positions. He had 6 sacks in 2017 and 3.5 this season. He was also bothered by a shoulder injury early in the season this year. These numbers are a little alarming and could cause him to fall in the draft, but sack numbers don\u2019t mean everything. There is a way to be productive and disruptive without the numbers, as we see in Philly with Fletcher Cox and Brandon Graham. We know they are great relentless pass rushers, but they may not get all the sacks/credit. Overall, I think he will be very productive in an NFL system, with NFL coaches, finding his best fit. Placing Gary next to Tak McKinley, Vic Beasley, and Grady Garrett is a MONSTER combination!\nGary Highlight Video:\nA True Boom or Bust\nMany see Gary as a Boom or Bust candidate. I believe Gary is the definition of a Boom or Bust Candidate. Gary has all the attributes to be a terrific NFL player. He has the ceiling, with a good D-Coordinator, to become one of the most disruptive pass rushers in the league who can be placed inside and outside on the line. He would not suffer in a scheme change, as he is very athletic to play in a 3-4 scheme. I could Gary become a Brandon Graham as well. Meaning, he could take time to adjust to the league, before building up his sack numbers and reputation. Worst case scenario, is that he would be unable to find a natural fit along the Defensive Line. He would still be a good rotational player in this scenario, just not a star starter. Can\u2019t get anymore Boom/Bust than that!\nEd Oliver Slide? More like the Rashan Gary Slide\nWe heard all along throughout the past few months that there could be an Ed Oliver slide, but due to an impressive combine and pro-day, it seems less likely to occur. What seems to be occurring is a Rashan Gary slide. Recent mocks have Gary landing somewhere in the top 10 to the Raiders pick at 24. BGN\u2019 s own Ben Solak, in his latest 6.0 mock draft, has the Falcons taking Gary at 14 as well.(Great Minds think alike!) I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll make it out the top 12, but if we have another QB frenzy draft, Dan Quinn and Co would love to scoop him up!\nFit on the Falcons and Falcons Draft History\nThe Falcons don\u2019t have many \u201cneeds\u201d, but the spots where they have \u201cneeds\u201d must be filled with good and productive players. Rashan Gary was the best player on the board in our BGN mock draft and filled a Falcons\u2019 need. The Falcons also need a Right Tackle and Cornerbacks. I believe they have addressed the Offensive Line well so far in free agency and should find a developmental Right Tackle later in the draft. This draft also has some aggressive cornerbacks and there should be some good ones that fall to round 2. Addressing the D-Line does not have to stop with Gary. Another interior D-Lineman could be taken in the mid rounds as well. The Falcons in the first round have drafted all across the board in recent years with Jake Matthews, Vic Beasley, Keanu Neal, Tak McKinley, and Calvin Ridley. I believe the Falcons will stick to Dan Quinn\u2019s Defensive Background this year in the draft and would go bonkers for Rashan Gary.\nGreat Character and an Awesome Mama\nIn relating to character, Rashan Gary is a standup guy. I recently saw a special on the NFL Network about Gary and his close relationship with his mother. It was a wonderful look into Gary\u2019s life and the support he receives from a great mother. The video shares a story about his mother, Jennifer, who commentated on some of his high school games on the team\u2019s PA system. It shows the dedication and strong relationship that Rashan has with Jennifer and that support will always be there. This is great to see, especially when a few years ago another player\u2019s mother decided to show her \u201csupport\u201d for them on TV.\nDoes anyone remember Annie Apple? She is the mother of Eli Apple, formerly of the New York Giants, now on the Saints. When Eli Apple was getting drafted, his mother went on the NFL Network many times, not only to promote her son, but also boast about herself. This kind of relationship between mother and son did not seem right, but of course the Giants drafted him in the first round. Look where he is now, already on his second team! Glad to see Rashan Gary have a strong supporter and good background along with his talent.\nVideo of Rashan Gary and his mother Jennifer:\nVideo of Annie Apple:\n(Embedding disabled for this video - click here)\nFinal Thoughts\nIt was great to be included in this year\u2019s BGN mock draft! I had so much fun and would love to join again next year. Overall, I think Rashan Gary will be a really great draft prospect for any team that takes a chance. The Falcons would be a terrific destination. I think Gary will probably end up somewhere in the top 15, but if he drops below 15, I would not rule out the Eagles making some calls to snatch him up. Sadly, I don\u2019t think Ed Oliver will be falling far either which is said for the Eagles and extremely depressing for the guys at SB Nation\u2019s \u201cThe Falcoholic.\u201d Those guys have an affinity for Oliver and talk about trading up for him many times. Don\u2019t be surprised if the Falcons get Oliver or Gary. That would make for a beastly D-Line. Watch out for the Falcons next year, that is until they play the Eagles(Matt Ryan sucks vs Eagles). The draft is right around the corner! Can\u2019t wait! Thanks to BLG and the other dedicated BGN members that will help occupy my time leading up to the draft and the start the regular season with nonstop awesome coverage! Both Birds(Eagles and Falcons) are in store for a great year this year and possibly another playoff matchup! Until the Draft, happy mock drafting and enjoy the rest of the BGN mock draft. Thanks for surviving the long reading everyone! I\u2019ll leave you with the best fun fact out there:\nTHE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES ARE THE LAST TEAM TO SCORE A TOUCHDOWN IN A SUPER BOWL!\nP.S. In honor of the Washington Team being next on the clock, take a moment to be thankful for the current NFC East General Managers. They all should get raises and extensions!

    "https://www.nj.com/opinion/2018/09/trumps_cruel_attack_on_legal_immigrants_editorial.html": "The Trump administration is preparing a new rule that would punish legal immigrants who use health and nutrition programs like Medicaid or food stamps. It would make it harder for them to get green cards or citizenship, if they have used any of a long list of safety net programs, even temporarily.\nWe've heard legitimate concerns about people coming over here with no means to support themselves and becoming a burden on the American taxpayer. We can't throw our doors open to everyone who gets cancer in China or Mexico. But consider the impact on the ground. Three things are appalling about this, even for a fiscal conservative who favors restricting immigration.\nFirst, this rule applies to legal immigrants. Those who are here illegally are already banned from virtually all federal anti-poverty programs. That's right - despite Trump's rhetoric about people \"sneaking into the country,\" this is about denying care to someone who comes here legitimately for work, plays by all the rules, and then gets sick or falls on hard times.\nOnly whites need apply for citizenship? Trump now targets legal immigrants | Opinion\nThe second thing to understand is that most of the victims, by far, will be children; millions of whom are U.S. citizens. This is thanks to an entirely predictable chilling effect. Legal-immigrant parents, not up on the minutia of Trump policy, will be afraid to seek out benefits for not only themselves, but for their children who independently qualify.\nThey will forgo putting food in their kids' bellies and taking them to the doctor. Pregnant moms won't seek out checkups, for fear of jeopardizing their future legal status. This is happening already, local clinics say. And the confusion is deliberate. An earlier, harsher draft of this rule would have penalized immigrants not only for seeking out aid themselves, but for anyone in their household who did so.\nAmping-up this fear of interactions with the government, and discouraging use of these programs, is a calculated strategy by the Trump administration. And it's not only cruel. It could run up long term costs if kids and parents don't get adequate benefits, especially medical care. An untreated ear infection could lead to a serious and expensive illness.\nAnother reason this is bad fiscal policy: According to a report from the National Academy of Sciences, the public aid these immigrants get is typically short term, and the economic benefits they give our country kick in after that. Their reliance on safety net programs is most likely temporary, given that they are almost all working.\nSo whatever debt they run up during difficult times will be paid back in the long run. A government report commissioned, and then suppressed, by the Trump administration found the same of refugees. This is the problem with the idea that an immigrant who uses a safety net benefit at any time, or might do so in the future, is a \"public charge,\" as Trump's expansive proposal states.\nAs Shawn Fremstad from the Center for American Progress put it, \"What we need is a balanced immigration system that doesn't discriminate on the basis of class, rather than one in which you have to be Melania.\" Otherwise, we'll have trouble filling certain crucial but low-paying jobs, like caring for children or the elderly, which props up the higher earners in our economy.\nTrump's new policy is not just mean, it's bad economics. It reveals, too, that his administration - led by smug xenophobe Stephen Miller - just doesn't want more immigrants to dilute white America, even those who play by the rules that they are always touting. Because, in reality, it's not about who is \"legal.\" It's about dictating who gets to be an American.\nBookmark NJ.com/Opinion. Follow on Twitter @NJ_Opinion and find NJ.com Opinion on Facebook.",

Several remain critical and are undergoing surgery, Gov. Phil Murphy said during an afternoon press conference.\n\"This is a shaken community,\" the governor said. \"Everyone is trying to make sense of this.\"\nAerial footage showed the seating area of the bus, which was carrying students from East Brook Middle School in Paramus to Waterloo Village, torn from its chassis, and on its side in the center median.\nIt appears as though the bus struck the end of a guard rail, just past an opening that allows emergency vehicles to move between sides of the roadway.\n\"We had every injury type you can imagine for a scenario like this,\" said Jeff Paul, Morris County Director of Emergency Management. \"The children were all over. Some were (strapped in with seatbelts), some were out. ... We had patients laying all over the median and obviously on the interstate.\"\nThe crash, which happened at 10:21 a.m., occurred just west of exit 25 in Mount Olive, and closed the interstate. Exit 25 is the exit for Waterloo Village, and it is unclear whether the driver had missed the exit.\nParamus officials said the bus, owned by the board of education, was one of three en route to Waterloo Village, and that the two other buses had returned to the school, which dismissed sixth, seventh and eighth graders in the wake of the crash.\n\"This is a sad, sad day,\" Paramus Mayor Richard LaBarbiera said. \"Keep us in your prayers. Pray for Paramus.\"\nLaBarbiera said the community was coming together to support those impacted by the crash.\n\"As a father of three sons, I cannot fathom the level of pain and despair that the family of the student whose life was lost is feeling, and the loved ones of the teacher who also died are in the same horrific situation,\" LaBarbiera said.\n\"I ask all members of our Paramus community to keep the deceased and wounded and their families in their prayers as we work collectively to recover from this tragedy,\" the mayor said.\nWitnesses described a chaotic scene, with children battered, bruised and scared.\nFrank Iossa said he arrived on the scene minutes after the crash happened, while he was driving east down I-80. He said he arrived before police, and drivers were running out of their cars to help crying and screaming children out of the overturned bus.\n\"There were people pulling kids out of the rooftops, windows and doors. A few of them used my phone to call their parents,\" Iossa said. \"One kid was asking me, 'Where's my friend?'. It was pretty heart-wrenching.\"\nA nurse from South Carolina and New York City firefighter were among the many people who stopped to help the children, Iossa noted.\n\"Some of the kids were pretty beat up, some were cut and bruised. I saw a few taken away on gurneys,\" he said. \"Some could walk, some couldn't. One girl was complaining about her leg hurting.\"\nParamus Council President Holly Tedesco, who is also the borough's Police Commissioner, said that crisis counselors were at the middle school for students and parents. School was set to be open Friday, but officials said all trips have been canceled.\n\"This is a devastation for our community,\" she said. \"It's sad [at the school] right now. We're trying to find out information and trying to get as much information to the public.\"\nPolice did not immediately release the names of anyone involved in the wreck or provide details on the conditions of the injured. Officials also did not confirm if the children were wearing seat belts, which they said were installed on the bus.\nBergen County Executive Jim Tedesco, a former borough mayor and fire chief, praised first responders for their work to save lives at the scene.\n\"Sixty-five years I lived in this town and it's difficult to stand here today and talk about our education community suffering so deeply,\" he said.\nStaff writers Alexis Johnson, Allison Pries and Jeff Goldman contributed to this story.\nSophie Nieto-Munoz may be reached at snietomunoz@njadvancemedia.com.

Except if Australia win \u2013 then the UK or Germany might host. Yes, it\u2019s confusing.\nWhile this year\u2019s contest features much political tension and calls to boycott Israel\u2019s hosting of the show, Australia possibly winning the whole thing and an Icelandic band in gimp masks, it is classic Eurovision \u2013 meaning we can pretty much predict what\u2019s going to happen throughout the show.\nSo prepare yourself for four hours of general chaos.\nThere will be numerous mentions of unity and togetherness\nEurovision is all about delivering a message of diversity, despite once holding a contest in Kiev with the theme of unity with three white male hosts, and unity \u2013 and that will most likely be drilled in throughout the night by the four hosts, Assi Azar, Bar Refaeli, Erez Tel and Lucy Ayoub. Europe is one, guys!\nThis will then cause major, and understandable, backlash due to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and the ongoing conflict in Gaza.\nEurovision is about unity, guys (Picture: Getty Images Europe)\nThere\u2019ll be an anti-Israel protest\nRemember when poor SuRie\u2019s performance was crashed by a stage invader last year? We can see a repeat of that from a pro-Palestinian protestor, who will either crash the stage during a host link, try and steal Israeli entry Kobi Marimi\u2019s mic, or photobomb a camera in the crowd with anti-apartheid messages on a placard.\nUnfortunately, their message probably won\u2019t be heard due to poor sound and everyone will be very confused.\nBrexit will be addressed\nProbably not by the hosts \u2013 nobody else really cares \u2013 but poor Graham Norton will have to assure viewers that yes, once the UK leaves the European Union, they will still be able to enter Eurovision.\nHonestly, that should have been put in the referendum pamphlets.\nPeople will question why Australia are in the contest\nAustralia joined Eurovision in 2015, but a lot of viewers are still baffled as to why they\u2019re allowed enter. Well, the Aussies love Eurovision, and were invited in 2015 as part of the 60th anniversary celebrations. They did well, so they stayed on, but now they have to attempt to qualify via the semi-finals rather than gaining an automatic pass to the final.\nAnd if you need to explain to your mum or whoever why non-European countries like Israel, Cyprus and Armenia are in the contest, it\u2019s because members of the European Broadcasting Union can compete, and it has nothing to do with geography.

Sublime.\nBut the performance that makes us most nervous is Kate Miller-Heidke from Australia, who performs Zero Gravity atop a 16ft sway pole.

Every nation will decide to prefix the scores with gushing praise for Israel\u2019s show, which is all very nice, Belarus, but can we please move on, it\u2019s half 11 and we still have 18 countries to go.\nAt least 5 countries will inevitably have technical difficulties and a) announce the wrong votes for the wrong country, b) talk over the hosts or c) stand there in silence against the background of a Eurovision party.\nAnd of course, there\u2019ll be one spokesperson who makes it all about them. Do you really need to start singing???\nThe UK won\u2019t do as well as we\u2019d hoped\nNow, Michael Rice can sing. The man has pipes. And Bigger Than Us is actually a decent song. But forget about any thoughts of making the top 10, because this is a pretty strong year, and we can\u2019t see Michael leapfrogging acts like Malta and Cyprus to make it to the better half of the scoreboard.\nBut he should hold his head high either way, because it\u2019s all heading in the right direction.\nYou\u2019ll be furious that Fuego didn\u2019t win last year\nEleni Foureira is back for a special interval performance, with Mans Zelmerlow performing her 2018 entry for Cyprus, Fuego.\nIt came second behind Netta\u2019s Toy, and no disrespect to Netta, but HOW DID IT NOW WIN?

The fun of sports debates is that they\u2019re inherently subjective, and subjectivity allows for a discussion. But some things in sports are objective. When you ignore objectivity, then you\u2019re no longer allowing for a discussion on sports, and instead have someone yelling threats at you like what Shannon Sharpe did here.\nSecondly, there\u2019s no provided insight after the statement. Sharpe is having a sincere discussion about Dirk Nowitzki\u2019s career, and in the middle of it, Skip Bayless just interjects with an asinine statement to never be revisited. No facts or evidence was given afterward. Bayless just said a thing and supported the thing with nothing.\nWatch for yourself:\n\u201cI think Manu Ginobili is better than Hakeem [Olajuwon], but that\u2019s just me\u201d- #Spurs fan Skip Bayless pic.twitter.com/DujdkBKe14 \u2014 Crazy Fan Takes (@CrazyFanTakes) February 18, 2019\nFor those who can\u2019t watch/hear the discussion:\nSharpe: *talking about Hakeem Olajuwon being the greatest foreign player of all time*\nSkip: (Unprompted) I must add I think Manu Ginobili is better than Hakeem - but that\u2019s just me. I\u2019m going to throw it out there cause he\u2019s -\u201d\nSharpe: \u201cI\u2019m going to throw you out of the building.\u201d\nBayless: \u201c - You don\u2019t get how special Manu was. You don\u2019t get it.\u201d\nSharpe: \u201cYou better get up outta here, Skip.\u201d\nBayless: \u201cI\u2019m just saying, I\u2019m not gonna back off that.\u201d\nThis is easily the worst form of sports entertainment, with a VERY close second being bloggers talking about this form of sports entertainment. Again, it\u2019s not a discussion worth having. I\u2019m not even going to give the stats because we wouldn\u2019t have to revisit the stats to know the truth.\nWhat would happen if I did anyway?\n-\u201cWell, did you know Ginobili averaged 19.5 points in 2008?\u201d\n-\u201cOh, wow. That trumps Hakeem being the all-time leader in blocks any day!\u201d\nRaising a ludicrous point and immediately backing it by saying that it\u2019s your opinion isn\u2019t entertaining or insightful or even fun. It sounds like someone being edgy for the sake of being edgy - like the sports version of Ricky Gervais. You now just have a bunch of people gathering more talking points about how much of a terrible TV show host you are.\nStill, if Bayless was just looking for a bunch of people to discuss him (which he probably was), then congrats because he got me to talk about him.",

    "https://showsnob.com/2018/09/11/iron-fist-season-2-episode-10-recap/": "As one journey ends, another begins in the season two finale of Iron Fist.\n\u201cA Duel of Iron\u201d literally deals with the dueling natures of the characters throughout this season of Iron Fist. Danny and Davos, Joy and Ward, Mary and herself, Colleen and her past, all of these things have been a culmination of the past two seasons. In a way, this finale feels like an ending to the chapter which begun in season one. The flash forward teases a new story to come, and the possibilities are endless.\nThe actual fight with Davos doesn\u2019t last very long, and that\u2019s a good thing. All of the highlights from this season have involved the character-driven moments. It\u2019s nice to see how everyone deals with the consequences of their decisions from the past ten episodes rather than draw out the transference ceremony.\nNaturally, Davos doesn\u2019t take too kindly to Colleen having part of his power. The two are immense pain, with the serpent desperate to be whole. Davos levels the dojo before taking off to regroup back at the warehouse. Unfortunately for him, Walker has set up in the highest corner of the warehouse waiting for his return. \u201cA Duel of Iron\u201d has her happily singing a tune as she disposes of Chen\u2019s body and gets ready. It\u2019s the only time we\u2019ve seen her enjoy violence this season, and it\u2019s interesting seeing the different personality quirks for each alter.\nDavos doesn\u2019t find it quite as interesting as he tries to avoid each of her shots. Eventually, he uses the fist to knock her out of her vantage point to force a ground pursuit. Before she can strike, Danny and Colleen come running into the warehouse to interrupt this plan. Once again, Danny asks Walker to not kill Davos since they need him. Before he can explain much more Davos comes flying from behind to take down Colleen forcing Danny to take on Walker.\nJust as Walker is about to take him down, Misty comes blasting out of the locked room where Walker had placed her. While she loses her \u201cMaserati\u201d arm during the fight, the two do subdue Walker by triggering the sprinkler system and using a phone as a strobe light. This brings out the Mary personality, who gently ends the fighting before introducing herself to Misty.\nDanny goes to Colleen\u2019s side where the two go up against Davos. The fight ends relatively quickly not that Danny is there to tip the odds in their favor. Colleen completes the power transference and Davos begs her to end him. She informs him that would make her no better than him before walking away. The greatest punishment he can suffer is knowing he not only lost the power of the fist but to the woman he continually called a \u201cwhore\u201d throughout Iron Fist.\nNow that this war is over, where does that leave everyone? Davos is headed to prison, with Danny still offering him compassion and hope for a better path. Misty is unsure about taking the Captain\u2019s job still, but she does mention \u201cKnight and Wing\u201d has a nice sound to it. Could a private investigation business be in the near future? Could Daughters of the Dragon actually get a series? It definitely seems like Netflix is considering the possibility even if nothing is official.\nWalker isn\u2019t in jail, but she\u2019s definitely not heading into hiding like her previous plan. She confidently strolls into Joy\u2019s place but is surprised by a hobbled Joy holding a gun. Joy tosses the bag of money to her and begs her to leave. Unfortunately, an escape isn\u2019t what Walker is looking for anymore. She wants answers, which means she\u2019ll need the Rand connections, influence, and money to get them. Looks like Joy will be paying for her mistakes next season as well.\nWard ends this season of Iron Fist on a path towards something positive. He finally is able to open up at NA where he reveals just how lonely he feels. It\u2019s the most emotionally raw we\u2019ve seen him in a long time and Tom Pelphrey is absolutely captivating. While this is a step in the right direction, it isn\u2019t quite large enough for Bethany to forgive him yet. She wants to deal with pregnancy on her own for now because she\u2019s not sure whether he\u2019ll backslide again. It\u2019s easy to see her as being a little too hard on him, but it\u2019s actually a pretty justified fear to have with an addict.\nWhat kind of person will Danny be without the Iron Fist? Everything in his life is unclear now that the battle has been won. Especially with Colleen, with their relationship being unclear. He had her cross some personal lines this season, some she said would be hard to come back from. While they both still care about one another, their relationship is definitely no longer in the honeymoon stage. She heads to Bayard to let Mrs. Yang know that there\u2019s a new hero in town who will be watching her illegal activity.\nWhen she returns home, Danny has left. He discovered on the back of her family seal the mark of the Iron Fist. He leaves a letter where he explains the reason for him taking off. Turns out the Pirate Queen from her mother\u2019s story is actually the first woman to wield the Iron Fist. He believes it wasn\u2019t chance that led them to meet in the park, but it was his destiny to bring the fist to her so she could take up the mantle.\nIn the flash forward, she does just that. Colleen uses her fist to stop crime, and it lights up her ancient katana. Danny and Ward, who embarked on a soul-searching mission to Asia, have also become a well-oiled machine. Their friendship has been one of the best parts of this season of Iron Fist, and it\u2019s fun to see the two going on missions together. They\u2019re looking for whoever supplied Davos with the corpse of a former Iron Fist, a man apparently named Orson Randall. Danny also stole some guns which apparently have some sort of power from the dragon.\nHow will this effect a potential season 3 of Iron Fist? That\u2019s yet to be seen but this certainly feels like the beginning to a whole new chapter for all of the heroes.\nDid you like this season? Tell us in the comments below!",

It actually begins tonight, when the playoffs kick off. The deal also includes the grand finals, the Overwatch World Cup in the fall, and The Overwatch League\u2019s second season.\n\u201cClearly by the way we\u2019re going to be covering it, starting with the playoffs and the finals this year, certainly speaks volumes to our excitement and our enthusiasm overall for esports moving forward,\u201d ESPN Vice President of Digital Media Programming John Lasker said in a statement.\nAs esports have become more mainstream, there has been less pushback regarding their place alongside more traditional sports on networks such as ESPN. Former ESPN personality Colin Cowherd was among the most vocal opponents, taking issue with Blizzard\u2019s Heroes of the Storm being played on ESPN2 back in 2015. His former SportsNation co-host Michelle Beadle had a much different response, becoming enthusiastic about the game despite her initial lack of interest.\nThe International Olympic Committee is scheduled to host an esports forum in Switzerland later this month to discuss the possibility of video games becoming an Olympic event. They would potentially be added to the Olympics for 2024, but only non-violent video games will be eligible. This means we won\u2019t be seeing any games like Overwatch or Heroes of the Storm.

The polar bear responsible for the rare fatal attack was later shot and killed by another adult.\nThe victim's family have since praised the 31-year-old for his actions after he told his two young children to run away while putting himself between them and the bear to protect them from the attack.\n\"He was enjoying his day with his children,\" his uncle Gordy Kidlapik, told The Canadian Press news agency.\n\"They were surprised by a bear that had started to stalk or charge toward one of his children.\"\nThe children, described as elementary school age, managed to escape the bear unharmed and used a boat's radio to call the authorities.\n\"Definitely Aaron died a hero, he protected his children,\" said Gibbons' cousin, Eric Anoee, told CBC News. \"It's [the] right word to say right now.\"\nRCMP confirmed that Gibbons was unarmed at the time of the attack, although it is believed he would have had a weapon on his outing to the island, which is a popular fishing and hunting spot, reports the BBC.\nResidents of Gibbon's hometown of Arviat have described their shock at his death in what was the first fatal polar bear attack to occur in the area for 18 years.\n\"It's really just incredibly sad, we're a small community and when something like this happens, it affects the whole community,\" John Main, MLA for Arviat North\u2013Whale Cove said.\nDan Pimentel of Nunavut's Environment Department confirmed the last fatal bear attack in Nunavut occurred in 2000, 124 miles up the coast from Arviat in Rankin Inlet.\nAccording to a 2017 report from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, there have been a total of 20 fatalities between 1870 and 2014, although that list is likely to be incomplete, reports The Globe and Mail.\nNearly two thirds of those attacks were by young male polar bears who were starting to starve with around nine in ten attacks occurring between July and December when sea ice is at its lowest.\nPimentel said further investigations are needed to determine the health of the bear which killed Gibbons. \"That will have to wait until our conservation officers get there and are able to examine the bear,\" he said. \"There's only limited information you can get right away as to the health of the bear.\"",

In the article titled \"Drawings From Prison,\" Dixon described how the warden eventually brought him a photograph of the 12th hole at Augusta National and asked if he could draw it for him.\n\"I spent 15 hours on it,\" Dixon wrote. \"The warden loved it, and it was gratifying to know my art would hang in his house. Something about the grass and sky was rejuvenating. After 19 years in Attica (New York) Correctional Facility, the look of a golf hole spoke to me. It seemed peaceful.\"\nDixon completed about 130 different drawings of golf courses, despite never having played the game before in his life.\nDixon's talent was eventually brought to the attention of Golf Digest, which asked: \"Is Valentino Dixon innocent?\" in the article, which examined key witness statements and noted there was no physical evidence linking Dixon to the victim.\n\"It took about a hundred drawings before Golf Digest noticed, but when we did, we also noticed his conviction seemed flimsy,\" Max Adler, the magazine's editorial director, wrote in a follow-up story following confirmation of Dixon's release.\n\"The case is complicated, but on the surface it involves shoddy police work, zero physical evidence linking Dixon, conflicting testimony of unreliable witnesses\u2026 All together, a fairly clear instance of local officials hastily railroading a young black man.\"\nThe magazine's coverage prompted students at Georgetown University to pick up Dixon's case as part of their Prison Reform Project course last year.\nAmong the key details uncovered by the students\u2014Julie Fragonas, Isobella Goonetillake and Naoya Johnson\u2014was the revelation that prosecutors in the original case didn't reveal to Dixon's defense attorney that a test on Dixon's clothes for gunpowder had come back negative.\nMore shockingly, the man who did kill Jackson in 1991 even admitted it on camera just days after the murder.\n\"I don't want my friend to take the rap for something that I did,\" Lamarr Scott told WGRZ anchor Wanda Starke at the time.\nScott, who is serving 25 years in prison for an unrelated attempted murder, admitted to the killing again in court, saying he had got the murder weapon from Dixon.\n\"There was a fight. Shots were fired. I grabbed the gun from under the bench, switched it to automatic, all the bullets shot out. Unfortunately, Torriano ended up dying,\" Scott told the court, reported The Associated Press. \"I dropped the gun and ran and it was over and done with.\"\nJudge Susan Eagan said Dixon would have faced five to 15 years if convicted of criminal possession of a weapon and confirmed he was still eligible for release as that sentence had passed several years ago.\n\"So many times I've come close [to giving up], but God kept giving me the strength to keep on and now I know why,\" Dixon told Golf Digest after learning of his pending release.\nDixon's family also expressed gratitude for the Georgetown students' work in helping to overturn his conviction.\n\"If the opportunity comes that you can be a light to someone else, take it,\" said Dixon's daughter, Tina. \"You never know just how much of an impact you can make, and these Georgetown students have made a profound and lasting impact for my father and our family.\"",

A handful of migrants jumped into the Suchiate River below to swim for rafts. Others turned back toward Guatemala.\nCarrying backpacks and small children, many migrants simply sat down on the bridge. Some said that they had been tear gassed. As the afternoon drew on, a tropical storm, Vicente, formed nearby off the Pacific coast.\nJose Brian Guerrero, a 24-year-old Honduran traveling with neighbors and his extended family, told Reuters he had joined the caravan to escape violent street gangs, and to find work.\n\"There's nothing for us in our country,\" said Guerrero, who used to sell beans in Honduras.\nMexican authorities say that migrants must have valid documents in order to be admitted into the country.\nOn Friday evening, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said he had spoken to his Guatemalan counterpart Jimmy Morales for clearance to send civil protection personnel to help the Hondurans and to find transport for those wanting to return.\n\"We'll continue this operation for as long as is necessary,\" Hernandez said in a post on Twitter.\nShortly afterwards, Guatemala's government tweeted that Hernandez would meet Morales on Saturday in Guatemala City to implement a strategy for returning the Honduran migrants.\nMeanwhile, in a late televised address, outgoing Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto called the mass rush to penetrate the border \"unprecedented\", accusing some migrants of attacking police.\n\"Mexico does not and will not allow (people) to enter its territory illegally, let alone violently,\" he said.\nA similar caravan of Central Americans that formed in southern Mexico in late March also drew the ire of Trump, who on Thursday threatened to use the military and close the southern border if Mexico did not halt the new march.\nSuch a move would cause chaos on the crossing, one of the world's busiest, and badly disrupt trade.\nSpeaking in Scottsdale, Arizona on Friday, Trump said he \"appreciated very much\" Mexico's efforts to stop the caravan.\n\"If that doesn't work out, we're calling up the military - not the (National) Guard - we're calling up the military,\" he told reporters. \"They're not coming into this country.\"\nTrump has also threatened to cut off aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador - some of the poorest and most violent countries in the Americas - if they fail to prevent undocumented immigrants from heading to the United States.\nIn a tweet Thursday he had praised Mexico for its decision to send riot police to halt the progress of the caravan.\nTheir emigrants make up the bulk of people now caught trying to enter the United States illegally every year.\nSeveral migrants at the Guatemala-Mexico border spoke of entire neighborhoods leaving their homes to join the trek after news circulated on social media of a call for a new \"caravan\" to Mexico six months after the previous one.",

Cube made the assertion when he was asked about the beef between Drake and Pusha. He said he didn't know much about it, but noted that Drake's notoriety would likely drop.\n\"He had a good run. You've only got a three-year run in the rap game baby,\" Cube said on KMEL-FM Friday. \"You've only got three years at the tip-top of the rap game before you have to find your place in this thing. That's just the pattern. Everybody, Wayne when he was hot, three years on top and you were looking for somebody else.\"\nIt's unlikely that Drake will respond to Pusha's track, \"The Story of Adidon,\" after Rap-a-Lot Records CEO James \"J\" Prince told the rapper to ignore Pusha. \"I made an OG call to Drake this morning to tell him 'I don't want you to respond to this,'\" he said on Maryland's DTLR Radio Saturday. \"I call it a pigpen mentality. We gonna put this to bed because we can't get in the pigpen with pigs, because pigs turn into hogs, and then hogs get slaughtered. That's not his character. We ain't worked this hard to cheat ourselves over nothing.\"\nDrake did, however, respond to the art Pusha used for the track, which shows him in blackface. \"This was not from a clothing brand shoot or my music career,\" Drake explained. \"This picture is from 2007, a time in my life where I was an actor and I was working on a project that was about young black actors struggling to get roles, being stereotyped and typecast. The photos represented how African Americans were once wrongfully portrayed in entertainment.\"\nDrake stayed clear from responding to his alleged love child, who he apparently fathered with Sophie Brussaux, a former porn actress. She named the 7-month-old child Adonis. \"Adidon\" is reportedly the name of Drake's rumored sneaker collaboration with Adidas\u2014a mix of his son's name and the sneaker conglomerate. \"Adonis is your son / and he deserves more than an Adidas press run, that's real,\" Pusha raps.",
    "https://www.newsweek.com/conservative-tomi-lahren-gop-alabama-abortion-ban-1429652": "Days after openly breaking from many of her conservative colleagues and publicly criticizing Alabama's new, heavily restrictive anti-abortion law, conservative commentator Tomi Lahren has published a new op-ed expanding on why she is going against the GOP grain in this matter.\nAlabama Governor Kay Ivey signed the bill, which effectively bans the procedure in the state and contains no exceptions for rape or incest, into law Wednesday, setting off a nationwide uproar over what is widely considered to be the strictest anti-abortion law in the country.\nLahren, one of the most prominent voices in conservative media, first expressed her departure from many other anti-abortion Republicans on Twitter, declaring that the \"Alabama abortion ban is too restrictive. It doesn't save life, it simply forces women into more dangerous methods, other states or countries.\"\nAmid backlash from her conservative peers for that Tweet, Lahren on Saturday delivered an op-ed for Fox News explaining stance on abortion rights.\n\"I don't believe the government does many things well, including regulating health care,\" the 26-year-old wrote. \"If the pro-life movement really wants to support women to ultimately choose life when making the most difficult decision they've ever had to make, do you really think a government mandate is the way to do it?\"\nIn a nod to her conservative supporters, Lahren advocated for reducing the incidence of abortion through referrals to \"crisis pregnancy centers\" and \"churches\" rather than through outright prohibition.\nCrisis pregnancy centers are typically religiously-affiliated institutions that counsel women who may be considering an abortion away from the procedure and into going through with their pregnancy. These centers have been accused of marketing their services deceptively by initially leading potential clients to believe that they are an abortion provider.\nCalifornia passed a law in 2015 that required crisis centers in the state to more fully disclose their services, but that regulation was enjoined by the Supreme Court last year, and litigation over the disclosures remains ongoing in the lower courts.\nIn her new column, Lahren cited statistics showing that outlawing abortion \"does not prevent it\" and added that restrictions generally serve to make the procedure \"unsafe and usually unsupervised.\"\n\"Does that seem like the answer?\" she asked her supporters.\nLahren apparently has a different view of the politics of abortion than many of her conservative peers, who see abortion restrictions as a galvanizing issue for the evangelical right. According to her, an attempt to use these statewide bans as a vehicle for the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade would \"be the nail in the coffin of Trump 2020.\"\n\"And to the pro-choice conservatives out there who feel they can't speak up on this for fear of being called a 'fake conservative,' a 'baby killer' or anything else, I encourage you to find your voice and use it,\" Lahren said. \"The great thing about the conservative movement is that we welcome differences of opinion, or at least we should.\"",
    "https://mashable.com/article/snapchat-gender-swap-filter": "It is a truth universally acknowledged that there is a face filter for everything, from putting puppy ears on your head to horrifically swapping your face with inanimate objects.\nThe latest filter trend on Snapchat is gender. Yep, just gender. This filter, in particular, captured people's attention in a way that others haven't, becoming so popular that people have re-downloaded Snapchat, an app seemingly being left in the social media dust, to use it.\nThe filter is fairly simple: It swaps your features for traditionally feminine or masculine ones. When it rolled out last week, the internet had a field day, with users fantasizing about what it would be like to swap genders. But it wasn't all fun and games for the trans community, who had to witness both their cis friends and strangers suddenly turning the act of \"switching genders\" into the latest viral joke.\nWhat's worse is that this isn't one of the community-made filters available to download or ignore as you please. It's not just one amateur designer's attempt at humor. Coming from Snapchat itself, this means whatever impact the filter has is directly reflective of the company and its biases. This also allows more people to access the filter without having to actively seek it out, which increases its exposure.\nWhile you're having fun posting about your imaginary chiseled jawline or flawless face of makeup, you might want to consider how this filter perpetuates some pretty whack stereotypes before you post your selfie. After all, casual transphobia looks good on no one.\nSnapchat's filter problematically defines gender and presentation\nThe filter's \"male\" lens gives users a square jaw, scruff, and short hair. The female lens smooths out a user's skin, lengthens their hair, and adds makeup.\nThrough these changes, the \"gender-swap\" filter reveals what the company, and society in general, consider desirable presentations for men and women. That's because when conceiving of the idea of a filter that \"swaps\" your gender, there are assumptions the creative team must've made.\na.t. Furuya, youth programs manager at GLSEN\u2019s, told Mashable that, while intended as a \"fun\" joke, Snapchat is \"assuming gender is a binary between men and women and more specifically, physical characteristics of how men and women should present themselves.\" GLSEN is an advocacy organization for LGBTQ youth.\nWhen Mashable reached out to Snapchat to learn about its thinking, the company said that new features go along with their core mission of empowering self-expression. Lenses can transform our appearance and the world around us, it wrote, adding that filters are a kind of \"community storytelling.\"\nUnfortunately, this \"self-expression\" forgets the wide spectrum of selves people can express. By creating a filter meant to represent an entire gender, you must choose to buy into certain narratives of what it means to look a certain gender. What features are the most beautiful? What are the \"right\" features? This assumes that everything else is deviant to the norm or unnatural.\nThe filter also reinforces the heinous gender binary, implying that \"man\" and \"woman\" are opposite genders you can switch between. Furuya said this is limiting for everyone, and contributes to the narrative that there is only one right way to exist. \"Nonbinary people have existed for centuries and in different cultures, [and] reinforcing an idea that people are either hyper masculine or hyper feminine creates very narrow boxes for how people can outwardly present themselves.\"\n\"Gotcha!\" and digital drag deceit\nOn the whole, seeing cis people \"swap\" their gender for funsies gives off vibes of the old \"man in a a dress\" trope. Society says that it's not right for men to do things like wear makeup or have long hair. The sheer existence of trans women under the patriarchy is wrong. One may argue that the reverse trope \u2014 that of women donning shorter haircuts and \"men's\" clothing \u2014 is less negative for women, since it can be empowering for women to co-opt masculinity. That is, until it isn't.\nFilters like these can be potentially detrimental to trans youth because they delegitimize trans identities, Furuya said. They can create more hurdles for trans people to live authentically without humiliation, violence, and erasure. \"For trans students who already do not have laws or policies protecting their identities, this contributes to that discrediting sentiment that our identities are as fake as a Snapchat filter.\"\n\"This contributes to that discrediting sentiment that our identities are as fake as a Snapchat filter.\"\nWith the filter, if you turn your head too fast, wave your hand at the camera, or switch it off, the illusion disappears. Everyone laughs because at the end of the day, it was all just a trick of the eye. The joke here is that gender-bending is fun when everyone can return to \"normal\" with the flick of a head or the swipe of a finger.\nIt also doesn't help that men of Twitter and Instagram have been turning their experiences with facetuned femininity into experiments. Suddenly, men are creating fake Tinder profiles with their \"female\" selfies, catfishing unsuspecting horny Tinder bros, and screenshotting the responses in the name of ... something? Many claim that after receiving tons of unwanted harassment, they now understand how hard it is to be a woman online. The lesson some seem to have learned is an important one, but for others, the catfishing feels like a flippant joke.\nThe joke, if there is one, relies on the underlying \"gotcha!\" that comes with convincing unsuspecting cis men of your gender, only to pull the wool from their eyes and laugh at the homosexual panic. Even if it's meant to be light-hearted, the group that's targeted by the normalization of this kind of humor is already vulnerable \u2014 trans people.\nYour instant transition is another person's dysphoria\nThe virality of these \"gender-swap\" posts has meant that the internet has become even more of a casual transphobia landmine than usual. And the excuses fall flat: It's just harmless fun! Let people enjoy things! It might even be empowering! But it's hard to join in when the \"fun\" involves constantly reminding you of your dysphoria and the daily struggle of transitioning.\nViewing these posts from friends and family could contribute to dysphoria, because trans people are seeing those who are supposed to support and care for them participate in the humor of physical transition, Furuya said.\nOn Twitter, many trans people are imploring cis people to think critically about the jokes' consequences. Some feel that the cis community doesn't understand the frustration of watching someone construct \u2014 in a single swipe \u2014 what transgender people may work at through years of pain and hardship.\nEven just taking a moment to consider how mentally and physically exhausting it is to exist as a trans person can make all the difference in creating a more empathic and welcoming internet. Taking a step back can also help cis people consider the ways they interact with and support trans people offline.\nIt's almost never just a joke either. Furuya described casual transphobic humor, in online spaces or in everyday culture, as a \"snow ball effect\" that could lead to harm for the trans community. Letting these jokes slide allows cis people to become more comfortable with the dehumanization of trans identities.\n\"It is easier to not care about the safety of trans people if we are not a big deal to you,\" they explain. \"When you keep picking away at our personhood, what is left to value? These are how transphobic laws and policies can get passed, this is how trans people get overlooked for jobs, this is the direct impact of trans youth being bullied and unable to finish school.\"\nSnapchat emphasized that it understands how deeply personal identities can be. But it's hard to swallow that when there's a community of people saying the filter makes a mockery of \u2014 and belittles \u2014 their identities. The way cis people have broadcasted their brief flirtations with bending gender demonstrates just how easy it is to misuse the filter.\nMistakes like this aren't new for the company. Snapchat has gotten into hot water in the past over previous filter missteps, turning what should've been basic marketing campaigns into oh my god this is so racist territory.\nIt would be easy for fans of the filter to chalk up these criticisms as a few oversensitive opinions to a feature that can be turned on and off in seconds. The novelty will probably wear off by next week. The latest filter is probably already in the works.\nBut as long as there are photo-sharing apps on the market, facetuning isn't going to go away. That doesn't mean we should blindly put up with the mistakes Snapchat or other designers make. Gender isn't as simple as a filter you can swipe away.",

(Photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images)\nAs Tennessee basketball looks to replace lost talent, Penny Hardaway got the top recruiting class. That puts pressure on Rick Barnes and the Volunteers.\nThere\u2019s no debate anymore. With the Memphis Tigers securing a commitment from five-star Precious Achiuwa, they have the No. 1 ranked recruiting class across all services. Meanwhile, Tennessee basketball is trying to replace its four most important players from last year.\nBack in December, when the Vols beat the Tigers at the FedEx Forum, Penny Hardaway went out of his way to restore the intensity of the rivalry. He continually took shots at Rick Barnes and UT throughout the year, even as Rocky Top was spending weeks on top of the polls while his team missed out on the NCAA Tournament.\nBut Tennessee basketball was eliminated from the NCAA Tournament in the Sweet 16. Then, knowing that Admiral Schofield and Kyle Alexander would leave, they began to realize that Grant Williams and Jordan Bone would also leave early for the NBA.\nMeanwhile, Hardaway went from being a coach who could only secure local kids and players he had connections with to getting kids from all over the country. His class now includes two five-stars, including the best player in the country, and five four-stars. And it comes one year into the rivalry being restored.\nYour move Rick Barnes. Seriously. The next two games between the schools are in Knoxville in Nashville. Given all the talk Hardaway levied against UT this past season, it would be embarrassing for them to fall behind the Tigers in terms of the state of the programs and even lose to them outside of Memphis when they own the rest of the state.\nAnd they already are falling behind in recruiting. Right now, the Vols have a class that includes two three-stars, a player who is sometimes a three-star and sometimes a four-star depending on the service you use, and one five-star in Josiah James who can be a four-star on some services. The class overall is a top 30 class. But it\u2019s not No. 1.\nAdd in the fact that the Vols lost so much talent, and it\u2019s easy to see the Tigers having a leg up on them. Now, it\u2019s true, Hardaway still has to coach these recruits. And even when the rivalry between the Vols and Tigers was at its peak, when Bruce Pearl and John Calipari were there, Calipari focused more on one and done elite talent while Pearl developed really good players.\nBut while Calipari is doing that on a higher level the Kentucky Wildcats now and the Vols have reinvigorated that basketball rivalry, Hardaway just beat him out for that top class. And his class this year is better than any class Calipari ever secured for the Tigers.\nThere is some good news, however. Barnes is still going the graduate transfer route for some players, and there is still talent on the Vols at this moment. Their new recruits, particularly James, should help with that.\nAlso, as we said, Tennessee basketball has always been a program more about developing talent. Hardaway may be able to develop the talent, but at this stage in their careers, Barnes is clearly more proven at doing that.\nFinally the only comparable class to this one ever secured at Memphis was 2010 under Josh Pastner. That was the No. 2 ranked class overall, and it turned out to be a total bust. Well, part of that was because he is a total bust as a head coach.\nStill, it\u2019s unfair to compare Pastner to Hardaway. After all, Pastner canceled the UT-Memphis rivalry because he thought it hurt the Tigers in recruiting. Hardaway just proved it didn\u2019t. And Hardaway does have some track record of developing talent since he spent years coaching at the high school level. Pastner has been a head coach for 10 years and still has none.\nSimply put, there are lots of unanswered questions about what will happen between Tennessee basketball and Memphis. But for them to assure themselves the top class across all services with a major pickup the same day Grant Williams announced he\u2019s staying in the NBA Draft is a big deal. And the Vols need to hope they can respond next year.",

    "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/girl-choked-officers-hit-punches-thrown-norristown-carnival-brawl/199483/": "What to Know Videos show teens and police fighting at a carnival in Norristown, Pennsylvania.\nOne of the officers in the video appears to place a teen girl in a chokehold and exchanges punches with another.\nPolice say several arrests were made and they continue to investigate the incident.\nPolice in Montgomery County are investigating after an officer was captured on video seemingly applying a chokehold to a teenage girl and exchanging punches with another during a melee at a community carnival.\nVarious cellphone videos show two Norristown Police Department officers attempting to detain a grounded teenage girl as a group of shouting juveniles surrounds them Saturday night at the St. Francis Spring Carnival in Norristown. The officers were responding to a call of a fight involving more than 50 youths, Norristown Chief of Police Mark Talbot said.\n\"The crowd ignored all orders by the police and continued to fight. Officers reported being kicked, shoved, and punched and were forced to call for assistance from several surrounding departments,\" Talbot said.\nOne video shows that as one officer pins to the ground the girl who they were initially trying to detain, a second officer tries to keep the crowd away. The second officer then goes to assist his partner, which is when some of the teens get closer, one girl reaching between the girl on the ground and the officers.\nThe second officer then shoves the girl away and gets up, apparently trying to detain her. Various teens then swarm him as two other girls turn their attention to the girl and the officer still on the ground.\nThe girls stand inches away from the officer, who is now using his left arm to hold on to the grounded girl by the throat, and repeatedly shout at him as he motions for them to get back.\nOne of them takes a step toward the officer, prompting him to punch her in the torso with his free hand. As the second officer returns and continues to keep the crowd at bay, the second girl juts her head toward the grounded officer and continues to shout at him, which is when he uses his free hand and seemingly punches her in the face.\nThe girl responds by punching the officer four times in the head before his partner tackles her to the ground.\nVarious youths then get on top of both officers, seemingly grabbing at them and trying to pull them off the girls.\nA third officer finally arrives, pushing away many of the juveniles before grabbing his pepper spray and repeatedly shouting at them to \"get back.\" That's when many of the teens run away and an onlooker seemingly attempts to shield the police as the third officer assists the other two in trying to detain the grounded girls.\nOfficers made \"several\" arrests, Talbot said.\n\"A full and thorough investigation is being conducted. We are committed to uncovering all of the relevant facts and will proceed in a transparent and impartial fashion,\" the chief added.\nOn Sunday, Chief Talbot held an open forum in which he addressed the community's concerns regarding the video.\n\"This is not a racist police department,\" Talbot said. \"This wasn't an act of terror by police. These officers were overcoming a significant amount of resistance.\"\nPolice will investigate the conduct of the officers involved and determine whether the hold the officer placed on the girl was warranted.\nThe teen girl who was placed in the headlock as well as her mother both spoke to NBC10. The girl claims the responding officers mistakenly believed she was involved in an earlier fight between a group of teens.\n\"I was saying, 'I can't breathe. Can you please let me go?' It was pressing right on my neck. I couldn't breathe at all. It was terrible,\" the girl told NBC10.\nThe girl also said her cousin was the teen who was punched by the officer and later body slammed to the ground. The girl's cousin remains in custody and will have a court hearing Monday after being accused of assaulting an officer.\nThe girl and her mother both want an apology from the officer and for him to be fired.\nJosh Nelson, who attended the carnival with his family and witnessed the fight, defended the officers' actions, telling NBC10 they did nothing wrong.\n\"They did what they had to do,\" Nelson said. \"They jumped in the middle of the crowd. Started moving people. People started hitting them. They were just pretty much trying to police the situation.\"\nOn Monday at 2 p.m., students from nearby Stewart Middle School walked out of class and arrived at the carnival site to protest the incident. They said they wanted the officers involved to be held accountable but they also condemned the actions of the teens who were fighting as well.\n\"I'm helping them to understand it was two,\" Yvette Madden, one of the students, told NBC10. \"It was both parties. They made some wrongs. The officers made some wrongs as well.\"\nNBC10 also spoke with Jamison Rogers, a police expert who analyzed the videos and concluded the officers handled the situation as best as they could.\n\"There are guns that are exposed to the backs of the officers that anyone could get a hold of,\" Rogers said. \"I do believe there was an immense amount of restraint.\"\nRogers also pointed out that no weapons were drawn during the altercation.\nAll of the officers involved in the incident remain on duty as the investigation continues.",

The phone parts were in remarkable condition, considering they had been belched from the ocean, Claire Simonin-Le Meur, president of the environmental group Ar Viltanso\u00f9, told The Washington Post. Even Garfield\u2019s black stripes were still painted onto his back, where the phone hooked.\nNP Posted Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the National Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

Simonin-Le Meur said the common belief among locals was that the phones came from a wayward shipping container that must have sunk to the bottom of the ocean, leaving environmentalists to fear Garfield\u2019s plastic toxicity would continue to pollute the ocean indefinitely. In 2018 alone, at least 200 pieces of Garfield had been found on beaches in northwestern France, Franceinfo reported. If they could just salvage the long lost shipping container, Simonin-Le Meur said, perhaps Garfield would stop coming.\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content Photo by FRED TANNEAU/AFP/Getty Images \u201cWe were looking for it, but we had no precise idea of where it could be,\u201d Simonin-Le Meur said. \u201cWe thought it was under the sea. We asked people who were divers to look for it. We get a lot of submarines in the area too \u2014 it\u2019s a military area. But they said it was not possible the container could be there and nobody saw it.\u201d This year, however, something changed. Simonin-Le Meur got a tip. It came from a local farmer named Ren\u00e9 Morvan. All of Franceinfo\u2019s recent publicity of the bizarre phenomenon and its environmental impact had apparently sparked his memory. One day last month, Simonin-Le Meur said she met Morvan on the beach while cleaning up debris \u2013 including a Garfield part. \u201cAre you looking for Garfield?\u201d the man asked.\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content Simonin-Le Meur said yes, she was \u2014 she always was. \u201cCome with me,\u201d the man told her. \u201cI can show you.\u201d They said it was not possible the container could be there and nobody saw it Morvan started from the beginning. Back when he was 19 or 20 years old in the mid-1980s, he told her, a storm blew through the area \u2013 and before residents knew it, Garfield telephones were scattered all over the beach, just as Simonin-Le Meur had always been told. He and his brother were curious, Morvan said, and they decided to go exploring, touring the rocky coastline until they found what they were seeking. Wedged inside a cave, tucked into the seaside cliffs, there it was: a metal shipping container \u2013 and a cache of Garfield telephones, Morvan claimed he saw. The story struck Simonin-Le Meur as too good to be true. The tide was too high to bring her to the cave that day, Morvan realized, and so she would have to wait to find out if he was telling the truth. The shipping container, Morvan told her, was lodged so deep in the cave that it was nearly submerged, making the trip a dangerous expedition.\nAdvertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content But finally, last week, it was safe. The tide was low. And Morvan, Simonin-Le Meur said, ultimately was not kidding. Filming the discovery, a group of journalists and environmentalists, Simonin-Le Meur included, climbed up the rocky shore to the cave\u2019s narrow opening, finding snippets of a bright orange phone cord along the way. Garfield was scattered all about, just like on the beach. But when the group entered the cave, ready for the big reveal, they didn\u2019t find what they expected. It was clear the plastic cats had been there, Simonin-Le Meur said, but clearer still that most were already gone. \u201cOur preoccupation was to understand why we had so many Garfields everywhere. We thought it would be helpful to find the container so we can stop it. But that was unfortunately not the case,\u201d Simonin-Le Meur said. \u201cWhat we found was the remainder of the shipping container. And it was empty.\u201d\nAdvertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content Our preoccupation was to understand why we had so many Garfields everywhere It seemed the group had solved the mystery, she said, but not the problem. The \u201cT\u00e9l\u00e9phone Garfield,\u201d as it is known in an online catalogue for ubiquitous ocean debris, is just one plastic item among countless others that litter the ocean and the shore every year. In the region of northwestern France, the Garfield phone has become like an unwitting Smokey Bear, the mascot for the importance of ocean cleanup and the dangers of microplastics polluting the ocean. Lionel Lucas, who developed the online Ocean Plastic Tracker that catalogues discoveries of Garfield, told Franceinfo the Garfield phone was a \u201csymbol\u201d for the movement. \u201cIt is no longer garbage but evidence,\u201d Lucas said. Simonin-Le Meur said that she has tried to use Garfield particularly as a way to interest children in ocean pollution, given its allure compared to pieces of plastic trash. And while the recent purported discovery of Garfield\u2019s origins has drawn renewed interest, Simonin-Le Meur said, the discovery didn\u2019t change much in her eyes. \u201cWe found plastic last Friday and Saturday and Sunday, and we have found a lot of pieces of Garfield,\u201d she said. \u201cThings are just exactly the same.\u201d\nShare this article in your social network\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.",

An emergency declaration cuts the amount of paperwork needed to access those state resources, he said.\nNo communities had requested help as of late Tuesday morning.\nLocal leaders are not sure what it means\nLansing Mayor Andy Schor, who attended Whitmer's tour of Cristo Rey, said he hopes the state will be able to provide funding the city can use to reimburse shelters that are operating above capacity during the cold weather.\n\"We are going to find out if that's part of the state of emergency,\" Schor said. \"We most definitely need it.\"\nNo one will be turned away from a shelter, Schor said.\nIn a Tuesday press release, Ingham County emergency providers said there is \"some confusion regarding the Governor's request for a State of Emergency.\"\n\"That is a formality the state needs to do in order to transfer resources between different responders at the state level,\" the release states. \"That will not force businesses to close or restrict driving.\"\nAt Cristo Rey, the need is ongoing\nCristo Rey serves about 100 meals per day, offers mental and physical health care and operates food and hygiene pantries and gives away free clothes. It is open during the weekdays, Executive Director Joe Garcia said.\nBut the center should be open seven days a week and have more social workers who can help clients find the public services they need, he said.\nMore funding would help Cristo Rey serve more people, but the need \"is ongoing,\" Garcia said, and not addressed through the emergency declaration.\nState workers: No work Wednesday\nLate Wednesday, Gov. Whitmer announced State of Michigan offices would be closed because of the cold weather. Nonessential workers were asked to stay home.\nState offices in Michigan's lower peninsula also closed Monday morning amid the snowstorm, but only after most had already made their morning commutes.\nState workers returned to their desks Tuesday.\nMore:How much should you tip for food delivery in a blizzard?

    "https://sg.news.yahoo.com/oneplus-7-pro-finally-unlike-160026335.html": "Will any flagship smartphone announcement ever be a surprise again? At this point we highly doubt it, considering all the leaks and rumors that precede every single major smartphone unveiling these days. The OnePlus 7 Pro is finally official and while nothing OnePlus announced on Tuesday will come as much of a surprise to anyone who has been following all the leaks, the sleek new flagship phone is no less exciting than it would have been had we not already known everything there is to know.\nThe OnePlus 7 Pro features bleeding-edge specs, more power than any other Android phone on the market right now, and a stunning design that\u2019s unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before in the United States. While OnePlus hasn\u2019t announced a firm figure for the phone\u2019s screen-to-body ratio, this is as close as we\u2019ve come to a true \u201call-screen\u201d phone. There\u2019s no big notch like the one on Apple\u2019s iPhones, no teardrop notch like there was on last year\u2019s OnePlus 6T, and no big bezels anywhere around the screen. It\u2019s gorgeous. The OnePlus 7 Pro is also packed with new features we\u2019ve never seen before on a OnePlus device, including one of the most impressive cameras we\u2019ve ever tested. It\u2019s not all good news, however: the OnePlyus 7 Pro is also the most expensive new flagship phone OnePlus has ever released. It still costs far less than comparable handsets though, and Android fans will be more than willing to pony up when they see how impressive this new flagship phone truly is.\nRelated Stories:\nPixel 3a and OnePlus 7 are both cheap new Android phones, but one is way better than the other\nOnePlus will pay you up to $449 to trade in your phone for a OnePlus 7 Pro\nThe OnePlus 7 Pro is finally here, and it's unlike anything you've seen before\nBefore we dive in, you might be wondering why the OnePlus 7 Pro is the only new OnePlus phone we\u2019re talking about here. It\u2019s an understandable question, considering it\u2019s one of three new smartphones OnePlus unveiled on Tuesday. The answer is pretty simple, though: it\u2019s the only model that will be sold in the US. The entry-level OnePlus 7 won\u2019t be sold here because the OnePlus 6T will remain available instead \u2014 at a new lower price (8GB/128GB for $549, 8GB/256GB for $599) \u2014 and the high-end 5G version of the OnePlus 7 Pro won\u2019t be sold here because 5G networks won\u2019t be widely available in the US for quite some time.\nStory continues\nStarting with the OnePlus 7 Pro\u2019s new design, it\u2019s easily one of the sleekest phones that has ever been built. It features a huge 6.67-inch \u201cFluid AMOLED\u201d screen that is curved on both sides like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S and Note phones. The screen has plenty of cool features like a larger, faster in-display fingerprint sensor and HDR+ support, but two main things separate OnePlus\u2019 new display from anything we\u2019ve seen so far on other phones. First, the OnePlus 7 Pro is the first smartphone to feature a 90 Hz refresh rate, This means animations, scrolling, and pretty much everything else is smoother on the OnePlus phone than it is on rival handsets. Second, the OnePlus 7 Pro\u2019s screen has wonderfully thin bezels all around it, and yet it still doesn\u2019t have a notch like an iPhone or a hole-punch camera like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S10 series. In fact, there\u2019s no selfie camera anywhere to be found on the OnePlus 7 Pro.\nNo, OnePlus isn\u2019t crazy. The company knows most people would never buy a phone without a front facing camera. Instead of placing the camera in a bezel, a notch, or a hole cut out of the screen, OnePlus placed the front-facing camera in a small mechanism that pops up from the top edge of the phone. This happens automatically whenever the front-facing camera is needed, and it raises and lowers quite quickly. It also has an internal grommet to prevent moisture and dirt from getting in, and a cool safety feature to protect it from damage. If the phone\u2019s accelerometer senses a drop while the camera is open, the phone automatically retracts it to avoid damage. In terms of distance, we found in our tests that the camera is fully retracted within about 2 feet.\nSpeaking of cameras, improving the rear camera was a huge focus for OnePlus and the company definitely didn\u2019t fail to impress. A new triple-lens rear camera features a 48-megapixel main sensor, an 8-megapixel 78mm telephoto sensor for 3x optical zoom, and 16-megapixel ultra wide angle lens that captures a whopping 117\u00b0. The first two sensors are both supported by optical image stabilization as well as electronic image stabilization, and the OnePlus 7 Pro\u2019s new autofocus system uses three different technologies \u2014 PDAF, CAF, and laser focus \u2014 to help ensure images are crisp and clear every time. How well does it all come together? The OnePlus 7 Pro\u2019s rear camera scored a 111 on DxOMark\u2019s rigorous testing, just one point off the all-time high.\nWhere speed and performance are concerned, the OnePlus 7 Pro is the most powerful Android smartphone to date. 6GB, 8GB, and 12GB versions are available, and the phone has a RAM Boost feature that automatically and intelligently allocates RAM to certain apps and processes based on the user\u2019s habits. The OnePlus 7 Pro is also the first smartphone to use new UFS 3.0 flash storage chips. According to OnePlus, the phone\u2019s storage is nine times faster than the UFS 2.1 storage used in other handsets. Thanks to the Snapdragon 855 chipset and other optimizations, the large 4,000 mAh battery provides about the same battery life as last year\u2019s OnePlus 6T despite the larger, power-hungry display. It also comes equipped with the Warp Charge 30 tech OnePlus introduced on its McLaren Edition 6T last year.\nThe only real downside to be found is that the OnePlus 7 Pro is more expensive than last year\u2019s OnePlus 6T. We have come to expect a small price increase from one year to the next, but this year\u2019s increase is substantial \u2014 the entry-level OnePlus 6T cost $549 when the phone was released last year, while the most affordable OnePlus 7 Pro is priced at $669. Here\u2019s how the different SKUs are priced:\nOnePlus 7 Pro (Mirror Gray) with 6GB of RAM + 128GB of storage: $669\nOnePlus 7 Pro (Mirror Gray) with 8GB of RAM + 256GB of storage: $699\nOnePlus 7 Pro (Nebula Blue) with 8GB of RAM + 256GB of storage: $699\nOnePlus 7 Pro (Nebula Blue) with 12GB of RAM + 256GB of storage: $749\nIt\u2019s a big price increase compared to last year\u2019s model, but it\u2019s not bad at all when you put these prices in perspective. An iPhone XS Max with 64GB storage costs $1,099, while a OnePlus 7 Pro with 128GB or storage and more RAM is only $669. The 256GB iPhone XS Max costs $1,249, and that\u2019s $550 more than a 256GB OnePlus 7 Pro.\nThe new OnePlus 7 Pro has an official release date of Friday, May 17th, and it\u2019ll launch alongside new \u201cBullets Wireless 2\u201d Bluetooth earbuds for $99. Of note, some OnePlus fans in New York City will be able to get it sooner than that. The phone will be sold by T-Mobile in addition to OnePlus\u2019 online store, and the T-Mobile flagship store in Times Square will begin selling the OnePlus 7 Pro today, March 14th, at 2:00PM ET. T-Mobile will only carry the 8GB/256GB version of the phone, but it will offer both color options.\nThe OnePlus 7 Pro\u2019s complete specs follow below.\nBGR Top Deals:\nTrending Right Now:\nSee the original version of this article on BGR.com",

Police in Plano were investigating Chemirmir in connection with suspicious death and suspicious person calls at a senior apartment complex in that Dallas suburb and found evidence linking him to Harris\u2019 death in Dallas, authorities said. Plano is in Collin County.\nThe break in the case came when Chemirmir forced his way into the Plano apartment of a 91-year-old woman that March, telling her to \u201cgo to bed. Don\u2019t fight me,\u201d according to an arrest affidavit filed in Collin County. The woman was smothered with a pillow into unconsciousness and robbed. However, paramedics revived her and she told investigators that her attacker had stolen a box containing her jewelry. Police identified Chemirmir from a license plate number and were able to find and tail him days later, when they watched him throw a jewelry box into a trash bin. They traced the box to Harris, according to the affidavit.\nPlano police Chief Gregory Rushin said at the time that Chemirmir used his health care experience \u201cto his advantage in targeting and exploiting seniors, some of the most vulnerable people in our community.\u201d\nPolice said then that investigators were reviewing about 750 unattended deaths of elderly women for possible links.\nChemirmir\u2019s attorney, Phillip Hayes, said Thursday that this week\u2019s charges were a surprise and that he hadn\u2019t had time to review them yet.\n\u201cThese cases came out of the blue and I don\u2019t have any information on them yet,\u201d he said.\nBut he noted that Chemirmir \u201chas denied it since Day 1\u201d that he played any role in Harris\u2019 death. \u201cThey have circumstantial evidence that puts him in the area but that\u2019s as far as the evidence goes,\u201d Hayes said.\nIn addition to the murder charges, Chemirmir is being held on a charge of being in the country illegally.",

We'll see what happens.\"\nThe ex-City starlet also expressed his delight after breaking his scoring duck for the club, before defending the Blancos performance following an 11th La Liga defeat.\n\"It was a nice goal, but it was not worth it because the result was not from our side,\" Diaz added.\n\"We played well at the start, but it was complicated with one less in a field like this.\n\"You can talk about many players. There is a very high level.\n\"We are happy, but with the expulsion it was difficult. We fought until the end.\"\nZidane's side are destined to finish third in the Spanish top flight, with a home clash against Real Betis to take in next Sunday on the final day of the season.\nThe 2018 Champions League winners have failed to land any domestic or European honours over the last 11 months and changes are expected at the club during the summer transfer window.\nOne player who has been linked with a move away from the Bernabeu is Casemiro, but he stated after the loss to Real Sociedad that he's already looking ahead to the 2019-20 campaign.\n\"There are still three points left to play for at home and we're already thinking about next season,\" he said.\n\"We have to try and do better until the very last game.

However, a VAR check by the officials revealed that Robert Lewandowski was marginally offside and the goal was ruled out.\nThe Bavarians were unable to find a breakthrough and were forced to accept the draw, keeping Borussia Dortmund\u2019s dreams of the title alive.\nDortmund began the day five points adrift in second but Bayern\u2019s draw combined with their win over Fortuna Dusseldorf means the gap is just two points going into the final weekend.\nThe title remains firmly in Bayern\u2019s hands though, with a draw virtually certain of being good enough given there needs to be a 17-goal swing for Dortmund to better their goal difference.\nIt presents Bayern the opportunity to secure the title at the Allianz Arena for the first time since they moved to the stadium 14 years ago, with their previous nine title wins all secured away from home. It would also be a fitting send off for Franck Ribery, Rafinha and Arjen Robben, who will leave the German giants at the end of the season.\nBayern striker Lewandowski admits sealing the title at home would make it that extra bit special.\n\u201cI've dreamed of winning the championship title in front of our own fans,\u201d he told Bayern\u2019s website. \u201cIt would be a great feeling, a nice moment.\n\u201cI know the feeling of winning the championship title on the road, but I think it's completely different at home, when the atmosphere is still hot and you don't celebrate after winning it two, three weeks beforehand. It can be special. I hope we can achieve it on Saturday, then we can celebrate with the fans.\u201d\nEven if Bayern secure the title it seems likely Kovac will leave the club at the end of the season having reportedly lost the confidence of the board and fallen out with a number of key players.\nThe title is not a formality either, as Frankfurt aren't the type of side that will simply lie down and allow Bayern to celebrate.\nAdi Hutter\u2019s outfit, which came within a penalty shootout of the Europa League final, still harbour hopes of qualifying for next season\u2019s Champions League.\nThey are in a four-way battle for the final qualification spot along with Monchengladbach, Bayern Leverkusen and Wolfsburg; though the latter\u2019s vastly inferior goal difference effectively rules them out of contention.",

She said she pushed the man away, touching him in the process.\nShe alleged she remembered Kavanaugh pulling up his pants and laughing.\nRamirez told The New Yorker the incident left her \"embarrassed and ashamed and humiliated.\"\nMore:Second woman accuses Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault in New Yorker report\nHazy memories\nRamirez told The New Yorker that she was initially reluctant to come forward because she was intoxicated when the alleged incident occurred and \"her memories contained gaps.\"\nThe New Yorker report said that at first she \"was reluctant to characterize Kavanaugh\u2019s role in the alleged incident with certainty. After six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney, Ramirez said that she felt confident enough\" to come forward.\nThe New Yorker said it was unable to identify any other witnesses who remember Kavanaugh attending the dorm-room party in question.\nMore:Democrats ask Kavanaugh to withdraw as Republicans cast doubt on second assault allegation\nWho is Deborah Ramirez?\nRamirez, 53, was raised a \"devout Catholic\" in Connecticut, according to The New Yorker. She currently lives in Boulder, Colorado.\nRamirez studied sociology and psychology at Yale, where she graduated in 1987, along with Kavanaugh. NBC News reports that she is a board member and volunteer at Safehouse Progressive Alliance for Nonviolence, an organization that helps victims of domestic violence.\nShe is a registered Democrat but denied that her allegation was politically motivated, The New Yorker reported.\nRamirez's attorney Stanley Garnett told The New Yorker that she is \"as careful and credible a witness as I\u2019ve encountered in 36 years of practicing law.\"\nKavanaugh denies the allegation\nIn response to the New Yorker story, the White House released a statement from Kavanaugh who said the incident alleged by Ramirez \"did not happen\" and called the allegation \"a smear, plain and simple.\"\n\"This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen,\" Kavanaugh said. \"The people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so. This is a smear, plain and simple. I look forward to testifying on Thursday about the truth, and defending my good name \u2013 and the reputation for character and integrity I have spent a lifetime building \u2013 against these last-minute allegations.\"\nOn Monday, Kavanaugh sent a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and the Judiciary Committee's ranking Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., in which he said Ramirez had made \"a false and uncorroborated accusation.\" He denounced a \"frenzy\" to block his confirmation and a \"coordinated effort to destroy my good name.\"\nKavanaugh said the allegations \"debase our public discourse\" and are \"a threat to any many or woman who wishes to serve our country.\"\n\"Such grotesque and obvious character assassination \u2013 if allowed to succeed \u2013 will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from service,\" he wrote. \"I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process.\"\nThe White House weighs in\nOn Monday, President Donald Trump said Kavanaugh is a \" fine man with an unblemished past\" and dismissed the \"highly unsubstantiated statements from people represented by lawyers\" as \"totally political.\"\n\"There is a chance this could be one of the single most unfair, unjust things to happen to a candidate for anything,\" Trump said.\nWhite House spokeswoman Kerri Kupec dismissed Ramirez's allegation as a \"coordinated smear campaign,\" in a statement on Sunday.\n\"This 35-year-old, uncorroborated claim is the latest in a coordinated smear campaign by the Democrats designed to tear down a good man,\" Kupec said. \"This claim is denied by all who were said to be present and is wholly inconsistent with what many women and men who knew Judge Kavanaugh at the time in college say. The White House stands firmly behind Judge Kavanaugh.\"\nMore:Read Christine Blasey Ford's letter detailing the alleged assault by Brett Kavanaugh\nKavanaugh's friends support him\nThe New Yorker said it reached out to many of Ramirez and Kavanaugh's classmates to see if anyone could corroborate her allegation.\nThe magazine said that two of the men Ramirez identified as being in the dorm room where the alleged incident took place, the wife of a third man she said was there, and six more classmates all signed a statement disputing Ramirez's story.\n\"We can say with confidence that if the incident Debbie alleges ever occurred, we would have seen or heard about it \u2013 and we did not,\" the statement read. \"The behavior she describes would be completely out of character for Brett. In addition, some of us knew Debbie long after Yale, and she never described this incident until Brett\u2019s Supreme Court nomination was pending.\"\nMore:Analysis: Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation sets up a high-stakes trade-off for the GOP\nSome recall hearing about the alleged incident\nOne student, who chose to remain anonymous, told The New Yorker that he recalled being told about the alleged incident that night or the next day. He said he was \"100 percent sure\" that the person who told him about it identified Kavanaugh as the student who exposed himself.\nAnother classmate at Yale, now-emergency room doctor Richard Oh, remembered a tearful female student describing the incident but he could not recall who the student was.\nAccording to The New Yorker, Ramirez told her mother and sister at the time that something upsetting had happened to her but did not share details with them because she was too embarrassed.\nKavanaugh's roommate at the time of the alleged incident, James Roche, said he never witnessed Kavanaugh commit any act of sexual misconduct but he told The New Yorker that Kavanaugh was \"frequently incoherently drunk.\"\nRoche became friends with Ramirez, whom he called \"exceptionally honest and gentle.\" He said he could not \"imagine her making this up\" and said it was \"believable\" that Kavanaugh could have been involved in an incident like the one alleged by Ramirez.\nSenate Democrats call for a delay of Thursday hearing\nSenate Democrats are investigating Ramirez's allegation against Kavanaugh, The New Yorker reported, and some have called for a postponement of Kavanaugh's second confirmation hearing.\nCalifornia Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked Chairman Chuck Grassley for \"an immediate postponement of any further proceedings related to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh\" in a letter on Sunday.\nFeinstein called for an FBI investigation into Ramirez's allegation and repeated her call for an FBI investigation into the accusation by Christine Blasey Ford. Ford came forward a week before Ramirez with an allegation that a drunken Kavanaugh held her down and tried to remove her clothes at a party when they were both in high school.\nFord committed on Sunday to testify before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday at 10 a.m. EDT. Committee Republicans have insisted that only Ford and Kavanaugh will be the only witnesses called.\nThe New Yorker reported that Senate Democrats first learned of Ramirez's allegation from a civil rights lawyer.",

The poll has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.\nDemocrats have made health care a big issue in the upcoming congressional midterm elections, charging that Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress have worked to undermine gains made by Obamacare in the affordability and quality of health care coverage.\nRepublicans, meanwhile, are campaigning on their tax cuts, which they say have spurred economic development and created jobs.\nMore:President Donald Trump's answer to Obamacare: Short-term health insurance\nMore:House votes to delay Obamacare insurance tax, loosen health savings accounts restrictions\nVoters expressed a higher opinion of Democrats than Republicans in the poll, with 50 percent saying they have a favorable view of the Democratic Party and 39 percent expressing a favorable view of the Republican Party.\nTrump did slightly better than his party, with 41 percent of voters saying they had a favorable opinion of the GOP president.\nThe economy was the only issue where Trump had a higher percentage of voters approving rather than disapproving of his performance. Poll respondents narrowly approved of Trump's handling of the economy, 49 percent to 44 percent.\nOn Trump's signature issue of border security, 44 percent of voters approved of the president's performance and 51 percent disapproved. On the broader issue of immigration policy, 39 of voters approved of Trump and 57 percent disapproved.\nOn international trade issues, 39 percent approved of Trump's performance and 53 percent disapproved. Trump has drawn bipartisan criticism for imposing tariffs on trading partners, prompting them to raise fees on food and manufactured goods coming into their countries from the U.S.\nOn foreign policy, Trump received an approval rating of 37 percent and a disapproval rating of 55 percent.\nTrump received his lowest approval scores on the issues of health care and race relations.\nThe poll showed that 36 percent of voters approved of the job the president is doing on health care while 55 percent disapproved. Trump and congressional Republicans have tried unsuccessfully to repeal Obamacare but have taken steps to partially dismantle it.\nOn the volatile issue of race relations, only 33 percent of poll respondents approved of Trump's handling of the matter while 58 percent disapproved.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who is retiring after the November elections, remains the most popular congressional leader, although \"popular\" is a relative term.\nRyan had a favorability rate of 31 percent, compared with 29 percent for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., 28 percent for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and 22 percent for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\nRepublican Sen. John McCain, the maverick Arizonan who is being treated for brain cancer, is viewed far more favorably than Trump or any of the congressional leaders. The senator, who has been highly critical of Trump on foreign policy, immigration and a host of other issues, received a favorability rating of 52 percent.\nAmong poll respondents, 49 percent identified themselves as Democrats, 39 percent identified themselves as Republicans, and 12 percent identified themselves as independents or \"other.\"",

Opening the year in Foxboro\u2019s Gillette Stadium, they\u2019ll be hosting a Bill O\u2019Brien-led Texans team for the fifth time in the last four years, six if you include the 2017 preseason game and joint practices from that week.\nFeaturing an electric young quarterback in Deshaun Watson, the Texans are coming off of a lost year when seemingly their entire starting lineup was injured. They didn\u2019t have a first or second round pick because of their last two quarterbacks, using the one to trade up for Watson and the two to dump Brock Osweiler\u2019s awful contract. Despite those woes, the Texans are always a tough matchup \u2013 especially when healthy on their defense.\nScouting the Texans\u2019 offense\nDeshaun Watson\nBelichick\u2019s Patriots have historically dominated Bill O\u2019Brien\u2019s Texans, as well as other coaches from his tree. But when preparing for the 2018 Texans, it\u2019s fair to say that only the game film from 2017 seems to be relevant, at least for their offense. Watson stole the starting job from an undeserving Tom Savage halfway through week 1 last year and looked like he belonged immediately. Watson was well on his way to winning offensive rookie of the year before he went down with a freak right ACL tear in practice in November.\nSunday\u2019s matchup will be just over ten months since the injury. Based on his preseason, Watson didn\u2019t look limited, but it\u2019s important to factor in the human aspect of injury. While Watson dazzled with his mobility with plays like these...\nI wouldn\u2019t expect to see a whole lot of plays like this on Sunday. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Watson is still mobile and the Patriots are right to treat him like one with the scout team quarterbacks, but I would be shocked if Watson approached the many out of the pocket passes and eight rushes that he had against the Patriots last year in his first real NFL game back.\nIf I were the Patriots, I would embrace what de-facto defensive coordinator Brian Flores has done with the Patriots defense in the preseason and send more pressure at Watson. The Texans\u2019 offensive line was terrible in 2017 and the only member of the line that started week 3 that will start on Sunday is center Nick Martin. But to be honest, the replacements that the Texans brought in don\u2019t inspire that much confidence.\nAt left tackle, they are starting Julien Davenport, a second year project fourth round tackle that was pretty poor in spot starts last year. At right tackle is Seantrel Henderson, an old Bills foe that hasn\u2019t started a game at tackle since 2015 because of Crohn\u2019s disease and all the weed he had to smoke to manage the pain. And they\u2019ll start two guys at guard that don\u2019t really scare anyone in Zach Fulton and Senio Kelemete. The Patriots will be able to get pressure with a four-man rush, but they should be able send extra guys because...\nDefending the skill players\n...without the available draft capital, the Texans didn\u2019t upgrade their offensive skill players, returning a group of DeAndre Hopkins, Will Fuller, Ryan Griffin, and Lamar Miller. With apologies to Sammie Coates, Tyler Ervin, Jordan Akins, and Keke Coutee, the Texans\u2019 fifth offensive skill player should not present an obstacle to the Patriots\u2019 defense. A game plan of the 6\u20191 Eric Rowe with the safety shaded to his side on Hopkins, and Gilmore on Will Fuller makes a lot of sense, leaving the other guys with winnable matchups.\nFor the Texans offense, a lot hinges on how good Watson will be and how much of a threat he is as a mobile QB just ten months removed from a surgery that usually takes a full year to recover full explosiveness. The Patriots couldn\u2019t have done a worse job with Watson last year, but they return with an improved and more athletic defense that should be up to the task.\nScouting the Texans\u2019 defense\nLet\u2019s talk about the pressure\nDespite having missed most of the last few years with injuries, the face of the Texans\u2019 franchise is still J.J. Watt, who at his peak was clearly the best defensive player in the NFL. And while he isn\u2019t the same monster that he once was, he\u2019s still among the best in the game with Jadeveon Clowney and Whitney Mercilus feasting off of the double teams he still draws.\nLast year, the Patriots struggled mightily to contain the dangerous trio in their one-on-one matchups. Brady was sacked five times, including a fumble-six forced by Mercilus on a clean win against Solder:\nEven when the Patriots completed some nice plays, Brady was getting hit, and hit hard \u2013 nine times to be exact. Here are the four non-sack hits on Brady from that game:\nThis was probably Brady's best throw last year. Clowney and McKinney destroy Thuney and Solder with a stunt and both Mercilus and Watt draw double teams on the right.\nThe Texans D-Line is so dangerous. Expect a heavy dose of Develin and Allen on Sunday. pic.twitter.com/IG107bRDAT \u2014 Tian (@tianrossi) September 6, 2018\nThis is the same exact play and protection with McKinney and Mercilus switched. That kind of pressure is way too easy against a 6 man protection. Thank God that Tom Brady is Tom Brady. pic.twitter.com/5KcE9nWlLo \u2014 Tian (@tianrossi) September 6, 2018\nOn each of those four plays, the Texans run some sort of stunt and get a hit in on Brady. It\u2019s on the left tackle and guard in the first three clips and over the center on the fourth clip. This kind of quick pressure generated by four players against a 6-man protection is just unreal and speaks to the talent of the Texans\u2019 defensive linemen. On four of the biggest plays of the game, the Patriots felt compelled to have their most talented skill player chip in protection, and despite that, pressure made it through.\nThe Texans have made a change at defensive coordinator with Vrabel off coaching the Titans, but the scheme should remain the same. Romeo Crennel (who was also the defensive coordinator in Texas from 2014-16) runs the same kind of schemes and Belichick is obviously well acquainted with his strategy as well. I expect the Patriots to be much better prepared for the Texans\u2019 pass rush.\nPersonnel\nThe Patriots\u2019 top three wide receivers in that game were Chris Hogan, Brandin Cooks, and Danny Amendola, with Phillip Dorsett only chipping in with seven snaps as the fourth wideout. Hogan, Dorsett, and Cordarrelle Patterson is obviously a step back from that trio and I suspect that the Patriots will adjust accordingly. In last year\u2019s game, James Develin and Dwayne Allen played a combined 50% of defensive snaps. This Sunday that number should be closer to 100%. The Patriots need to take advantage of Mercilus and Clowney covering and playing the run in their base defense.\nThe Patriots are still going to have to chip Watt and Clowney on the edges and ideally, they would prefer that guy to be Allen. I would also bet on the Patriots inserting some tight end screens or phantom blocks into the game plan to take advantage if the Texans get too aggressive.\nFor the rest of the Texans\u2019 defense, the Patriots should have an advantage against the secondary, but it has improved over recent years. One common theme from the Texans over the last decade or so has been that they could never have quality safety play. From Danieal Manning to D.J. Swearinger to Andre Hal to Quintin Demps to Eddie Pleasant to Corey Moore... you get the picture, they have all been mediocre fill-ins at best.\nThis offseason, they finally realized the position to be a glaring weakness and signed Tyrann Mathieu, while moving back long time cornerback Kareem Jackson to safety to shore up the position. It will be very interesting to see how those two match up against Gronkowski and James White/Rex Burkhead because both of their starting linebackers (McKinney and Zach Cunningham) can\u2019t cover for shit.\nJohnathan Joseph is somehow still starting for them at CB along with Kevin Johnson and ex-Jag slot guy Aaron Colvin. Not a group that is going to shut you down, but a group that has seen Brady many times and could pose a problem to one of the weakest and shallowest wide receiver positional groups that Brady has ever had.\nMy two cents on the Patriots offense: heavy on the ground game and bigger personnel to set up play-action passing. While the Texans mostly relied on a four-man rush in obvious passing situations, according to PFF they were the tied for the most aggressive team in the NFL when it came to blitzing on 1st down, making them even more susceptible to this strategy.\nFinal Thoughts\nIt seems criminal to type out 1,500 words and not mention the special teams battle so I guess I\u2019ll put a little blurb in here. The Texans have consistently been a bottom-ten special teams positional group and they fired Patriots special teams legend Larry Izzo as their coach in the offseason. It\u2019s too early to tell if there will be improvements, but the Patriots should be able to comfortably outplay them in that aspect of the game. I\u2019m excited to see Cordarrelle Patterson in the return game.\nAll in all, the Texans are no pushover, and represent a real threat to the Patriots in their home opener. That being said, I think that the Patriots learn from their first meeting with Watson and win and cover on Sunday. I think that there will be plenty of scoring drives for both sides but I don\u2019t see how they have the second highest over/under of the week. For all of the betting men out there, I\u2019ll take Patriots (-6.5) and the under (51).\nWeek 1 prediction: Patriots 27 Texans 20",

Updates are being posted here.\nORIGINAL STORY:\nMARSHALLTOWN, Ia. \u2014 The pews at St. Henry Catholic Church in Marshalltown began filling up long before Saturday evening's Mass began.\nParishioners arriving early to pray the rosary for a missing Marshalltown teen were greeted by a woman and her two daughters handing out green pins, missing 13-year-old Corey Brown\u2019s favorite color.\n\u201cIs this for the boy who ran away?\u201d a young girl asked aloud as Lisa Dougall pinned a green ribbon to a nearby churchgoer\u2019s coat. Recitation of the Hail Mary echoed in the background.\nDougall, a friend of Brown\u2019s parents, said the ribbons are just one way the community is trying \u201cto help bring Corey home.\u201d\n\u25ba The latest:Missing Marshalltown teen found dead after days-long search\nBrown was last seen Tuesday night when he left his parents\u2019 home in south Marshalltown after having a \"disciplinary discussion\" in which his phone was taken away, Police Chief Michael Tupper said during a news conference Thursday.\nThe search for the eighth-grader entered its fifth day Sunday as the community rallies around the missing boy and his family, amid extreme winter weather conditions.\nGreen ribbons were tied around trees and neighbors replaced porch lights with green bulbs \"to light the way for Corey to come home,\" Dougall said.\nBrown\u2019s parents pleaded for their son's return Thursday at the news conference at the Marshalltown library.\n\"Corey, you know how much we love you,\" his mother, Michelle, said, according to television station KCCI. \"And I\u2019m not going to stop until we find you. If you\u2019re out there, please come home.\"\n\u25ba More:'Keep praying for Corey and his family': New pleas for tips in search for Iowa boy missing for nearly 48 hours\nThe Marshalltown library's director, Sarah Rosenblum, couldn't help but relate this trial to the July twister that plowed through the city of 27,000, damaging numerous buildings including the downtown courthouse. Memories are now tied to a timeline marked \u201cbefore the tornado and after the tornado,\u201d she said.\n\"It's been a hard six months, and now ... this is, I wouldn\u2019t say a bookend to the first six months, but it's certainly been a difficult situation,\" Rosenblum said, calling Brown's disappearance \"another really hard blow.\"\nWindow after window along Marshalltown\u2019s Main Street, still in the midst of rebuilding efforts, were covered in posters featuring Corey\u2019s smiling face Saturday.\nInside one of the businesses, Charlotte Santana, 35, ran a vacuum cleaner through Treemont Grille, a green ribbon pinned to her shirt as she worked.\nShe was one of a couple hundred community members who gathered together Wednesday, many sporting snowsuits and winter boots, to offer their help to police.\nOfficials thanked the volunteers for their dedication, but they were asked to leave the physical search to the hands of a few dozen trained professionals.\n\u201cAfter the tornado, I felt the same unity,\" Santana said. \u201cWhen a family in the community is in need, people come to help.\u201d\nAnd the community did answer officials' requests to do their part, sharing Corey's smiling face. Santana estimated every third post on her Facebook feed is related to the search.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely what people are living right now,\" she said.\nMarshall County Crime Stoppers and Lennox Employees Credit Union on Friday announced a $1,000 reward for anyone with information that could lead to Brown's discovery, said Mayor Joel Greer, who also serves as the vice president of the local crime stoppers group.\nGreer said he has seen Marshalltown come together in ways he couldn't imagine during his first year in office.\n\u201cNow, when we have another thing that could be a tragedy, we\u2019re kind of geared up to help each other, communicate, with each other,\" he said. \"It\u2019s a better feeling in town than we had a year ago.\u201d\nGreer asked residents to remain hyper-vigilant, to report any tip they get and to keep praying.\nOfficials have asked all property owners in the city to closely check their homes, garages, sheds and any other buildings in case Brown has taken shelter through the frigid temperatures and snowstorm that hit the night he went missing. A winter weather advisory is in effect from 3 p.m. Sunday through noon Monday, according to the National Weather Service.\nBrown was last seen at about 11:15 p.m. Tuesday wearing a Seattle Seahawks stocking cap, a red shirt, black pants, gray shoes and a black and lime green coat, according to Marshalltown police. He is 5 feet tall with brown hair and weighs about 100 pounds, officials said.\nTupper said his team continues to explore all possible scenarios and to devote full resources to the search, though he wasn't able to comment on specific strategies on Saturday.\nBrown's family, communicating through the police chief, declined to comment.\nAnyone with information is encouraged to call the Marshalltown Police Department at 641-754-5725 or Crime Stoppers at 641-753-1234.

He also made reference to an oft-cited story used to illustrate how impressive his NBA career has been: When Korver was initially drafted by the then-New Jersey Nets with the 51st pick in 2003, he was essentially sold to the Philadelphia 76ers for enough cash to cover Summer League fees and to pick up a new fax machine.\n\"What's your trade value?\" he said, smiling at the podium. \"Mine was apparently a copy machine! It's OK. A few years back, that copy machine broke \u2014 and I'm still playing.\"\nZinn's quote about the impossibility of remaining neutral on a moving train allowed Korver to segway into revisiting the thesis of his Player's Tribune essay and personal responsibility white people like him have when it comes to systemic racism.\n\"As a white man, I could opt into the conversation about racism and inequality \u2014 but I could just as easily opt out. I've almost always opted out,\" he said. \"For people of color in America \u2014 and yes, even many NBA players \u2014 systemic injustices aren't something they get to opt in or opt out of. They're an everyday reality.\"\nKorver asked the Creighton University Class of 2019 to, above all, be \"someone who cares.\"\n\"Working hard is good! And money in itself is not bad. I'm not saying don't buy that car or go on that vacation. Go live it up,\" he said near the conclusion of his speech. \"Comfort and fun are parts of life \u2014 but we should be uncomfortable with the kind of comfort that comes at the expense of others.\"\nFor Korver, it's clear that a sense of self and the responsibility that comes with one's place in the world are part of an ongoing, lifelong journey.\nYou can read the speech in its entirety here or watch it below.\nFollow the Register on Facebook and Twitter for more news.

Even after the Game 1 loss, most expected the Lighting to level the series because it felt like the Lightning just stopped playing after taking over a 3-0 lead. The expectation was that they\u2019d learned a lesson and it wouldn\u2019t happen again. But now it\u2019s a reality and the team have to deal with it.\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of people comparing this situation to the last season\u2019s playoffs, when the Jackets eventually lost to the Washington Capitals after leading 2-0 before coming to homestand. I think this is a little bit different, the Jackets have earned both wins last postseason in overtime, thanks to outstanding perfomance by Sergei Bobrovsky. This time, the Bolts were seemed nearly helpless in some situations, allowing unnecessary turnovers and not being able to convert any of their power plays at the Game 2.\nNikita Kucherov has been suspended for tonight\u2019s game for an avoidable boarding of defenceman Markus Nutivaara. He should be happy that it\u2019s just for one game, as some expected a multiple game suspension.

Kucherov practiced with Danick Martel and will be replaced by Ryan Callahan during his suspension. Mathieu Joseph was promoted to the first line.\nJan Rutta was criticized by many fans after last game. He worked with Braydon Coburn on Saturday morning, so it\u2019s hard to say if we\u2019ll see changes on the blueline. Cameron Gaunce also re-joined the team from Syracuse this morning indicating that Hedman\u2019s status is uncertain for tonight.

Kristin Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research said that Ford can make Focuses \"in many other plants around the world, so if they decided to continue to sell a Focus variant in the U.S. market, there are several options other than building it in the United States.\"\nA day earlier, the president exhorted Apple to start building new plants in the U.S. after the tech giant warned that a proposed $200 billion in new tariffs on Chinese imports would jack up the price of its products.\n\"Our concern with these tariffs is that the U.S. will be hardest hit, and that will result in lower U.S. growth and competitiveness and higher prices for U.S. consumers,\" Apple said in a Sept. 5 letter to the office of U.S. trade representative. It asked the government to come up with other measures to bolster the economy. Back in May, CEO Tim Cook told Trump that duties \"were not the right approach.\"\nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for a comment on Trump's latest broadside.\nThe U.S. has imposed $50 billion worth of tariffs on Chinese goods with another $200 billion in the final stages. The public had until Thursday to comment on the administration's plan. Trump said Friday he is considering another $267 billion of tariffs on China, which analysts said will affect virtually every category of consumer goods, to retaliate against what he calls unfair trade practices.\nIn Ford's case, pulling the plug on the low-volume Focus Active won't be hugely significant to its business because it sells more than 2.5 million vehicles annually in its home market. But automakers may cull other vehicles as well if Trump continues to escalate trade wars with the likes of China, Europe and Canada.\nIn April, Ford announced plans to stop making cars in the United States -- except for the iconic Mustang -- and to focus on more profitable SUVs. It stopped making Focus sedans at a Wayne, Michigan, plant in May. The plan, said industry analyst Ed Kim of AutoPacific, was to pare down the Focus lineup to Active wagons and import them from China. \"Without the tariffs, the business case was pretty solid for that model in the U.S. market,\" Kim said.\nTRADE SURPLUS WIDENS\nChina's trade surplus with the United States widened to a record $31 billion in August as exports surged despite American tariff hikes, potentially adding fuel to Trump's battle with Beijing over industrial policy.\nExports to the United States rose 13.4 percent to $44.4 billion, ticking up from July's 13.3 percent growth, according to customs data. Imports of U.S. goods rose 11.1 percent to $13.3 billion, decelerating from the previous month's 11.8 percent.\nThat could help reignite U.S. demands that Beijing narrow its trade gap, which has temporarily been overshadowed by their clash over complaints China steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology.\nWith no settlement in sight, the spiraling conflict between the two biggest economies has fed fears it will chill global trade and economic growth.\nThe Commerce Ministry expressed confidence Thursday that China can maintain \"steady and healthy\" economic growth despite the trade pressure.\nChinese leaders have rejected pressure to scale back plans for state-led development of global champions in robotics and other technologies.\nTheir trading partners complain those violate Beijing's free-trade commitments and U.S. officials worry they might erode American industrial leadership. But communist leaders see their industry plans as the path to prosperity and global influence.\nAs tensions mounted, Beijing agreed in May to narrow its trade gap with the United States by purchasing more American soybeans, natural gas and other exports. Chinese leaders scrapped that deal after Trump's first tariff hikes hit.\nChinese exporters of lower-value goods such as handbags and surgical gloves say U.S. orders have fallen off. But sellers of factory machinery and other more advanced exports express confidence they can keep their U.S. market share.\nThe Chinese customs agency took the rare step of announcing August trade data on Saturday instead of a working day. That would give financial markets a chance to digest the politically sensitive data before trading opens today.\nThe Chinese trade gap with the United States was up from July's $28 billion and June's $29 billion. Beijing reported a record $275.8 billion trade surplus with the United States last year.\nForecasters had said China's sales to the United States, its largest national export market, might weaken after manufacturers rushed to fill orders ahead of Trump's first tariff hike July 6. But trade data have yet to show a significant impact.\nChina's global exports rose 12.2 percent to $217.4 billion, down from July's 12.6 percent. Imports rose 20.9 percent to $189.5 billion, down from 21 percent.\nThe country's global trade gap was $27.9 billion. That meant that without sales to the U.S. market, China would have run a trade deficit.\nChina regularly runs deficits with many of its trading partners that supply oil, industrial components and other imports and pays for those by running a surplus with the United States and Europe.\nExports to the 28-nation European Union, China's biggest trading partner, rose 11 percent to $37 billion. Imports rose 15 percent to $24.9 billion, leaving a surplus of $6.1 billion.\nInformation for this article was contributed by Gabrielle Coppola, David Welch and Mark Gurman of Bloomberg News; and by Joe McDonald and Paul Wiseman of The Associated Press.\nA Section on 09/10/2018",
    "https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/05/oneplus-7-pro-t-mobile-exclusive.html": "In accordance with teasers that went live over the last several days, the OnePlus 7 Pro has just been made available to T-Mobile customers, immediately after its launch event in New York City wrapped up.\nNaturally, there\u2019s a catch, or better said \u2013 a long series of them.\nThe speed you need (but not the variety)\nAdvertisement\nAs was the case with last year\u2019s OnePlus 6T, the first handset from the Chinese brand picked up by T-Mobile (or any other American carrier), the OnePlus 7 line lacks diversity if you\u2019re only looking at what\u2019s available for purchase from the self-proclaimed Un-carrier. The middle of the three configurations is the only one being sold by the wireless juggernaut, which is unsurprising seeing how the $699 configuration using 8GB of RAM and 128GB of flash storage space is already expected to be the most popular choice from the series.\nAt least that\u2019s UFS 3.0 memory we\u2019re talking about seeing how the industry took its sweet time transitioning to the newer and faster (and more expensive) storage specification. Another positive thing of note is that T-Mobile will be offering the \u201cmid-range\u201d OnePlus 7 Pro variant in both Nebula Blue and Mirror Grey, with the latter also being the official spelling of the model\u2019s name in the U.S. The Android phablet is set to be offered for as little as $29.17 per month, with no upfront payment being required.\nUnsurprisingly, T-Mobile is limiting that offer to \u201cwell-qualified\u201d customers, i.e. those who aren\u2019t in any outstanding debt with the carrier or any one of its subsidiaries. The quoted price also assumes you agree to a two-year contract, a standard practice when it comes to mainstream devices in the country.\nAdvertisement\nWhether OnePlus is now a mainstream brand is a different debate altogether, though the company certainly seems to think so; after all, it made a pretty significant gamble by dropping its annual $30 price hikes in favor of a device that\u2019s nearly $100 more expensive than its direct predecessor. Sure, the regular OnePlus 7 was also announced but it\u2019s not happening in North America. It\u2019s also priced identically to the OnePlus 6T \u2013 \u20ac550. As for American consumers who still value the value factor, the OnePlus 6T won\u2019t be discontinued just yet, whereas that\u2019s precisely what\u2019s happening with the device in European and Asian markets set to receive the OnePlus 7 in the coming days.\nNever settle (for online orders)\nAnother unsurprising twist limiting the availability of the OnePlus 7 Pro to T-Mobile customers has to do with the fact that the said demographic can currently only get their hands on that single configuration at the T-Mobile Times Square Signature Store, as well as launch event locations in San Francisco, Miami, Chicago, Las Vegas, and Sancta Monica. Everyone else will have to wait until 6 AM ET on Friday, May 17.\nAdvertisement\nFinally, T-Mobile confirmed the new Android phablet has been optimized to fully leverage the current capabilities of its 600MHz network but don\u2019t expect the telecom giant to eventually pick up the 5G version of the device; that particular model is extremely unlikely to be released in the U.S.\nIn case you\u2019re looking for more choice than what T-Mobile is offering from what appears to be one of the most complete high-end smartphone ranges ever, your only remaining option is the OnePlus webshop.",

Mr Mambosasa said the number was likely to rise as investigations continued.\nHe did not name those in police custody, but on Thursday he had indicated that the initial arrests involved security staff of the Colosseum Hotel: five guards from G1 Security and the security manager.\nCCTV footage\nAdvertisement\nThe police also visited the Yacht Club on the shores of the Indian Ocean, where Mr Dewji is believed to a member, to study CCTV footage. The management, however, said he did not go there on the day he disappeared.\nMr Dewji was abducted as he went into the exclusive Colosseum Hotel and Fitness Club in Oyster Bay, an affluent neighbourhood in Dar.\nEyewitnesses say masked men arrived in two vehicles and parked outside the hotel before Mr Dewji got there around 5am.\nA taxi driver said that as Mr Dewji drove in, two white men got out, seized him, forced him into one of the cars and sped away while shooting in the air. The Dar es Salaam police chief said footage retrieved from the hotel\u2019s security cameras was not clear.\nWhat is known is that Mr Dewji drove himself to the gym from his residence, on Laibon Street, Oyster Bay. Information gathered from a Colosseum Hotel staffer has it that the businessman usually drives himself to the gym for routine morning workout.\nNet worth\nMr Dewji is the owner of Mohamed Enterprises Tanzania Ltd (MeTL), a conglomerate that has a footprint in at least five African countries.\nHe deals in textiles, beverages, edible oils and cereals.\nFor decades Mr Dewji has been involved in sisal plantations that he acquired from the government.\nForbes magazine estimates his net worth at $1.5 billion.\nHe is a major shareholder of Tanzania\u2019s premier league champions, Simba Sports Club, with a 49 per cent stake. Simba is one of Africa\u2019s oldest football clubs. In the early 2000s, Mr Dewji was one of the top sponsors of Simba during which time the club reached the last eight of the African Champions League in 2003.\nMohammed Dewji often turns up to cheer on Simba Sports Club at the Dar stadium.

The poll panel\u2019s decision to clear Modi and Shah in all cases of MCC violations, made in a May 3 meeting came in for significant criticism.\nThis was followed by news reports that Lavasa had disagreed with the decisions, although this dissent wasn\u2019t registered in the orders that were passed.\nThe orders themselves came ahead of a scheduled Supreme Court hearing in a case on the EC dragging its feet over complaints regarding violations of the code of conduct by Shah and Modi filed by Congress leader Sushmita Dev.\nThe specific complaints discussed at the EC meeting regarding Modi and Shah included the PM\u2019s speech in Nanded in Maharashtra on April 6 where he referred to the majority being a minority in Wayanad (Congress President Rahul Gandhi\u2019s second constituency); and for his speech in Varanasi where he said 42 terrorists were killed to avenge the death of 40 troopers in Pulwama. Shah was let off for his remarks in an election rally in Kerala where he purportedly said that it was difficult to make out if Wayanad is in India or Pakistan.\nOpinion | Election Commission should appear to be \u2018fair\u2019\nThe person familiar with the matter said that Lavasa has sent several reminders to the Chief Election Commissioner since May 4, to include minority decisions or dissent notes in the final orders. The Election Commission has not passed any orders on violations of the model code since, although it has asked those behind alleged violations for explanations, the official added.\n\u201cThe commissioner had earlier sought to know why his dissenting note was not made part of the final orders issued by the commission,\u201d said this person.\nChief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora did not respond to text messages seeking comment.\nA former finance secretary, Lavasa differed with the decision of the two other members of the poll body, Arora and election commissioner Sushil Chandra, while deciding on the cases of model code of conduct violations against Prime Minister Modi and BJP President Shah. He suggested sending a notice to Modi, which wasn\u2019t accepted. There were at least six complaints in which the PM was given a clean chit, while Congress president Rahul Gandhi was let off in one case.\nA bunch of complaints pertaining to the violations of the model code of conduct, including one against Prime Minister Modi, for addressing former PM Rajiv Gandhi as \u201cBhrashtachari No 1\u201d is now pending with the commission.\nOn whether the commission can go ahead with the meetings in his absence, the person cited above said the rules allow for a majority decision and therefore, a decision can be taken in his absence.\nAs per the Election Commission (Conditions of Service of Election Commissioners and Transaction of Business) Act, 1991, if the chief election commissioner and other election commissioners differ in opinion on any matter, such matters are decided according to the opinion of the majority. The commission transacts its business by holding regular meetings and also by circulation of papers. All election commissioners have equal say in the decision making of the commission.\nHT reported on May 6 that the EC had justified not including the dissenting opinion on the grounds that since the decision on the violations was not a quasi-judicial decision, the dissent was not recorded. However, a former CEC said on condition of anonymity that such dissenting opinions have to be included in the final order even in cases of MCC violations.\nIn 2017, the then EC OP Rawat recused himself from cases related to the Aam Aadmi Party after party leader Arvind Kejriwal questioned his independence.\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE ON",

He added that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeclaration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that hinted at consensual relationships was only half the truth as there are clear signs of abuse in each of these \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrelationships\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\n\"This declaration cannot be considered as proof, it is only one that was given to the Church.

She was a minor then and Abraham was studying to be a priest.\nThough the priest got married, he wanted her to continue the relationship, according to her statement. It went on after her wedding too.\nIn 2009, during her child's baptism, she reportedly confessed to another priest about her relationship with Fr Abraham Varghese.

TNM does not have details of the nature of her complaint against him.\nThe fourth priest that she has mentioned in her complaint is a counsellor who works with the church. During the course of counseling, this priest is also alleged to have sexually abused her.\nFrom December 2016 onwards, the counsellor had asked the woman to book themselves in five star hotels. The survivor told the police that unable to afford the hotel bills, she was even forced to borrow or steal money from her family.\nThe Crime Branch has booked four priests Fr Abraham Varghese, Fr Job Mathew, Fr Johnson Mathew and Fr Jaise George on charges of rape and molestation.\nAlso read: Kerala Orthodox church 'sex-for-silence' row: Crime Branch books 4 priests for rape",

    "https://www.thedrive.com/news/22179/future-tesla-buyers-may-soon-lose-7500-tax-credit-as-automaker-passes-threshold": "It seems that Teslas have been selling well; in fact, one could argue that they've sold too well. In a surprise find by publication Green Car Reports, Tesla has become the first manufacturer to surpass the threshold for the federal tax credit in the United States.\nWhile that doesn't mean much for business-as-usual at the domestic electric car manufacturer's headquarters, it does mean a lot to the consumer who is counting on the tax credit to deem the vehicle as being affordable. One of Tesla's biggest selling points was that even though its vehicles cost more upfront than a traditional gas-model car in the same class, there were certain incentives that helped the consumer swallow the inflated cost. One of those incentives was the federal tax credit of $7,500 for the buyers of a new electric car. Tesla often uses this credit as part of its sales model to show the cost savings over a traditional gasoline-powered car in terms of total cost of ownership\nWhen buying a Tesla, the Federal Tax Credit is outlined as being a saving., via Tesla\nCurrently, the federal tax credit must be claimed by the person who becomes the first registrant of a qualifying electric car purchased brand new. This entitles a total of 200,000 tax credits to be issued for each individual manufacturer before the $7,500 credit begins to dissolve. Within the first three months of the threshold being met, future claimers will have their incentive cut in half, bringing their tax credit to $3,750. Six months later, it will be halved once more to $1,875. This continues for six more months until it is finally diminished completely and no additional tax credits are issued for that particular manufacturer. This means that new Tesla owners (and potentially GM owners in the near future) will likely be unable to claim a full credit by the end of this year, and all incentives may be stripped as early as the end of 2019.\nIt was the hopes of many that the federal tax credit could reduce the cost of the Model 3 to less than a Chevy Bolt, however Tesla has still not released a timeline for the release of its $35,000 option, leaving the potential for buyers of the $35,000 Model 3 to be in tax-credit-limbo until further notice.\nThis tax credit model has been criticized as being difficult for domestic automakers once their incentives run out. It was designed to help work the manufacturers through the s-curve of adoption and innovating new technology, however, electric cars still aren't as affordable or practical to refuel as their gasoline-powered counterparts. Arguments could speculate that late-adopting brands may be at a greater advantage to reap the benefits of lower component costs and still be able to sell vehicles at market price, making their net gains higher while early-adopters tread the uncertain waters of how sales will fare in a post-subsidized world.",

The attorney said he temporarily shut down the account because of online threats.\n\u201cThis is just crazy that somebody can just tweet something out like this, or post it, and people just take it as truth,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201d\nAvenatti, a possible presidential contender in 2020, said his client is \u201c100 percent\u201d real and still planned to come forward.

The CW has released a preview for \"Hey, World!\", the sixteenth and final episode of the season.\nThe episode's title seems to be a play on \"Heyworld\", the theme park of magical creatures that Nate created as a kid, which Hank Heywood (Tom Wilson) was trying to bring to life by partnering up with Neron. What exactly that will mean for the array of magical beings we've met over the course of this season - and for the Arrowverse as a whole - remains to be seen.\nOf course, there's also the nature of what's happening in the Arrowverse as a whole, with the highly-anticipated \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" crossover expected to happen next season. While Legends sat out of this season's \"Elseworlds\" crossover in a rather amusing way, it sounds like they might not be out of the picture for \"Crisis\".\n\"People are already talking about crossover 2019,\" showrunner Phil Klemmer teased last October. \"We're on standby. I don't know how that will work. There's already a loose shape for it even though this year's crossover isn't done by a long shot. I was happy to have sit this year out just because we only have 16 and our run of episodes was so tight and integrated. It's always a blast but it's a departure. I'm glad we got to do a straight run this year.\"\nYou can check out the synopsis for \"Hey, World!\" below!\nSEASON FINALE -- While on a mission to find Ray (Brandon Routh), Constantine (Matt Ryan) and Nora (Courtney Ford) discover Neron's evil plan. Nate (Nick Zano) convinces the Legends to think outside the box and suggests a dangerous plan to unite magical creatures and people to save the world.\nCaity Lotz, Dominic Purcell, Maisie Richardson-Sellers, Tala Ashe, Jes Macallan and Ramona Young also star. Kevin Mock directed the episode written by Phil Klemmer & Keto Shimizu.\nLegends of Tomorrow airs Mondays at 8/7c on The CW. \"Hey, World!\" will air on May 20th.",

A direct sequel to 2007's Crackdown, it's known for being a decent follow-up to the 2007 cult-classic, but not nearly as good or noteworthy.\nOf course, what makes Crackdown 2's addition to the Xbox One backwards compatibility library so notable is the fact that all three games in the trilogy are now available on the Xbox One.\nSpeaking of the trilogy, the game's third and potentially final game released last month: Crackdown 3. However, while Crackdown 2 came up short compared to its predecessor, Crackdown 3 managed to come up even shorter. Here's a snippet from our review explaining what went wrong:\n\"Crackdown 3 has had a very turbulent development process with many cancellation scares and numerous delays since it was initially revealed back in 2014. Now that it's here, the Xbox exclusive takes fans of the franchise back into the world of chaos and destruction, but does the game live up to the years-long hype? Well, we've got some bad news.\n\"Overall, Crackdown 3 is very much a Terry Crews simulator, so for fans of the actor it's practically a dream come true. That being said, even the excellent writing and Crews himself isn't enough to make it a smashing success for the Xbox One platform. The dated graphics, clunky mechanics, and monotonous progression is enough to overshadow a game that really did have a lot of potential.\"\n-----\nHave you subscribed to ComicBook Nation, the official Podcast of ComicBook.com yet?

    "https://comicbook.com/dc/news/aquaman-movie-poster-dceu/": "Look what the tide just turned in! With Comic-Con International coming this week, Warner Bros. is ready to wow with its superhero slate, and Aquaman caught a big wave to celebrate. The film's first poster is out, and it is as gorgeous as you have hoped!\nSo, are you ready to meet Arthur Curry's fishy friends or what?\nWarner Bros. has released the first official poster for Aquaman, and there is plenty to unpack in the image. As you can see Jason Momoa is featured front-and-center as he channels Aquaman. With his tattooed torso bared, Arthur Curry looks as toned as ever, and the sly smirk gracing his lips promises all sorts of trouble for Atlantis.\n(Photo: Warner Bros. Pictures)\nOf course, the underwater imagery of the poster is impossible to miss. The awe-inspiring poster shows the kind of detail put into the film's watery setting, and pieces of Atlantis can be seen in the background. The city's towering buildings seem to be built into a coral reef, and it has plenty of fin-traffic going through its waterways. After all, there are dozens of sea creatures backing Aquaman in this poster, and the posse is not one you'd want to mess with.\nThis poster also debuts the film's first tagline. Just above Aquaman's trident, fans can see the text \"Home is calling\" written in standard text. So, fans will get to see Arthur curry swim into a homecoming whether he wants to or not.\nFor fans, this big reveal is just one which Aquaman plans to drop this week. Director James Wan already confirmed the film's first trailer will go live at San Diego Comic Con, and he teased the much-awaited reel on Twitter. Wan posted a photo featuring a still from the trailer, and it appears to show Aquaman wielding his golden trident upon a rock while a huge whale breeches the ocean before him.\n\"Working overtime to put the finishing touches for this coming week,\" Wan teased.\nSo far, story details have been kept quiet about Aquaman, but much of the film is expected to come to life this week. Last year, Momoa spoke with ComicBook about how Arthur differs in his solo film as opposed to Justice League, and it all comes down to his shifting identity.\n\"Surpassing Justice League, this moment in time is his call to become king.\" Momoa said. \"The only thing that can save Atlantis is me fighting my own brother. There's a big battle, and there's an epic [fight]. It's also a big road movie, because we travel all over the world.\"\n\"It's got that Star Wars quality of gigantic ships and guys riding sharks. It's going to be this whole world you've never seen before. You're going to see him start as this guy who probably rides bikes, works on cars. You get to see him this one way as kind of a dirty, dark, drunkard, and then turn into this regal king.\"\nWhat do you make of this first Aquaman poster?

    "https://comicbook.com/anime/news/dragon-ball-super-goku-dies-reaction-anime-dub/": "Believe it or not, Dragon Ball Super just offed its main character. For fans who've kept up with the show's dub, they will know its most recent episode did something controversial with Son Goku. After a long break, the Saiyan got his butt handed to him in battle, and the skirmish ended with Goku dying.\nSo, as you can imagine, fans are freaking out over the big to-do.\nOf course, audiences know better than to consider Goku's death a permanent or even semi-permanent one. Over the years, the hero has died several times, but Goku's first death in Dragon Ball Super is too temporary. Not only does the death occur in a filler saga, but fans of the show's subbed version know Goku will be revived with all haste.\nStill, fans cannot believe Goku got taken by surprise like this. Hit managed to kill Goku using his unique Time Skip technique, allowing the Universe 6 assassin to land a deadly hit to the Saiyan's heart. The stunning turnaround knocked all the Ki from Goku as the famed hero fell dead. Just beyond keeling over, Goku had enough time to shoot a rogue Ki blast into the air, and it will be that technique which ultimately revives him. But, from a technical perspective, Hit does actually kill Goku.\nAs you can see below, audiences on social media are roaring over the surprising kill. Thanks to Goku's death, Hit has joined a very exclusive club of people who've led to the Saiyan dying. In the past, Piccolo technically killed Goku when the green fighter blasted the Saiyan to kill Raditz. Goku was also killed later in Dragon Ball Z when Cell self-destructed, but both of those cases were fully vetted by the hero. Goku may have hired Hit to take a hit out on him, but the Saiyan had no way of knowing whether the assassin would be able to kill him. So, you can understand why fans are shaking their heads at Goku right about now.\nWhat did you make of this surprising death? Let me know in the comments or hit me up on Twitter @MeganPetersCB to talk all things comics and anime!\nDragon Ball Super is currently airing its English dub on Adult Swim during the Toonami programming block Saturday evenings at 9:30 p.m. It is also available to stream on Funimation and Amazon Video. The Japanese language release of the series is complete, and available to stream on Funimation, VRV, and Crunchyroll.\nIf you want to catch up with the English dub, the first 52 episodes of Dragon Ball Super are now available to stream on FunimationNOW, VRV, and available to purchase on Amazon Video as well.",

    "https://www.news18.com/cricketnext/news/sri-lanka-vs-south-africa-1st-odi-in-dambulla-highlights-as-it-happened-1827011.html": "The Test series was conceded without much of a fight, but South Africa head into the five-match one-day internationals \u2013 the opener will be played on Sunday, 29 July \u2013 hoping the change in formats will change their fortunes.\nIn particular, they will want a better show against spin. In the 2-0 reversal in the Tests, South Africa were completely flummoxed by all of Rangana Herath, Dilruwan Perera, Lakshan Sandkan and Akil Dananjaya over the course of the two matches.\nHowever, the ODI side has plenty of fresh faces, unscarred by the Test series loss, and JP Duminy said they were \u201ccoming in with fresh energy, that will definitely add to the environment.\u201d\nIn fact, South Africa are hoping to do more than just cope. With the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 looming closer by the day, the visitors are aiming to make the most of the spin-friendly conditions in the sub-continent, what with wrist-spinners being all the rage now and most teams at the big event next year sure to use them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge value for us to be here \u2013 we\u2019re not in the subcontinent again for a while,\u201d said Dale Benkenstein, the South Africa batting coach. \u201cEven though we\u2019ve had a poor Test series, there\u2019s been a lot of work done on spin for a lot of batters. There\u2019s been a lot of learning going on. We\u2019re seeing this as a great opportunity to just get better.\n\u201cNot only the guys who are playing, but some of the young guys who are with us now. We tell them to use these conditions. Use the nets. Ask people around you. Try and get as much out of it as you can, other than just in the matches that are going on.\u201d\nSouth Africa lost their last ODI series 5-1, against India at home in February, with Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav taking 33 wickets between them. If the last few months are any indication, spin remains an area of concern for their batsmen, and as Benkenstein said, they have to make the most of their trip to the sub-continent.\nSri Lanka, meanwhile, have no such concerns. In January, they won the ODI tri-series in Bangladesh quite easily, seeing off the hosts and Zimbabwe en route.\nThey will be confident of carrying on that form. Angelo Mathews, their designated ODI captain, will take the reins again, even as Dinesh Chandimal, who stood in for him while Mathews was injured, serves a four-match ODI ban.\nIt is clear the hosts will continue playing to their strengths, with Dananjaya and Sandakan joined by the uncapped Prabath Jayasuriya, a highly touted left-arm spinner.\nThat said, in a format less grilling than Tests, South Africa will be confident of faring better.\nThe first ODI between Sri Lanka and South Africa will be played at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium, Dambulla on Sunday, July 29 and will begin at 04:15 GMT.\nSquads\nSri Lanka: Angelo Mathews (c), Dasun Shanaka, Kusal Perera, Dhananjaya de Silva, Upul Tharanga, Kusal Mendis, Thisara Perera, Niroshan Dickwella, Suranga Lakmal, Lahiru Kumara, Kasun Rajitha, Akila Dananjaya, Prabath Jayasuriya, Lakshan Sandakan, Shehan Jayasuriya\nSouth Africa: Faf du Plessis(c), Hashim Amla, Junior Dala, Quinton de Kock, Jean-Paul Duminy, Reeza Hendricks, Heinrich Klaasen, Keshav Maharaj, Aiden Markram, David Miller, Willem Mulder, Lungi Ngidi, Andile Phehlukwayo, Kagiso Rabada, Tabraiz Shamsi",

    "https://www.news18.com/news/movies/why-cheat-india-movie-review-emraan-hashmi-film-has-an-interesting-premise-but-lacks-urgency-2007217.html": "Just days before it was to be released the Censors demanded that the makers of Cheat India attach the word \u2018Why\u2019 to its title, presumably because the original title sounded a lot like a call to action, a command. And come on, you can\u2019t have a film actively encouraging the populace to swindle our great nation, can you?Why Cheat India, on the other hand, sounds too generic, and punctuation wise it\u2019s off. Is it asking a question \u2013 as in why do we, Indians, tend to cheat? That\u2019s a tricky one; we could be here all day. No, I suspect, that like movie critics, the Censors too might have been bored out of their skull watching this film. The new title, therefore, could be an expression of frustration \u2013 as if questioning the need for this film \u2013 \u201cWhy, Cheat India???\u201dBut jokes aside, the movie, directed by Soumik Sen, has an interesting premise. Emraan Hashmi, who has had some practice playing all manner of cheaters and fraudsters, stars as Rakesh Singh aka Rocky, a shrewd fellow who runs a scam helping wealthy candidates land seats in medical and engineering colleges by recruiting smarter students to take their entrance exams for them. He\u2019s a messiah for desperate parents and students who know that a medical or engineering degree is a shot at a better life, and a Robin Hood-like figure for the brilliant but poor toppers who have loans to be paid off, parents to support, and sisters to be wed. Everybody wins in Rocky\u2019s unique business plan.Everybody but the audience. Why Cheat India fast becomes a slog. The themes are relevant, but the writing is flat; the screenplay lacks urgency. The film opens in the 90s and to be honest it feels like it was made then. There is melodrama, dialoguebaazi, and old-school plotting. None of that would\u2019ve been a problem if it wasn\u2019t so darn unremarkable. The supporting players \u2013 there are many \u2013 aren\u2019t especially memorable, and a last minute twist feels unconvincing. The second half moves more briskly but the plot becomes especially harebrained when Rocky widens his net to crack the MBA entrance exam.It\u2019s a shame you leave the cinema bored and underwhelmed because there was potential here to make a smart film about our flawed education system \u2013 one that encourages mugging and rote learning over understanding; one that values a degree over real aptitude. A system that drives students and their parents to seek dangerous, unhealthy shortcuts. Some of that is addressed but it\u2019s not really what the film is about.Hashmi, who is also one of the producers, plays his part with required flair. He\u2019s very good in anti-hero roles, but this film can\u2019t seem to decide how to peg him. He spends the bulk of his time on screen exploiting the education system, but also gets to deliver an impassioned monologue skewering the corruption within that very system. Of the remaining ensemble, only Snighadeep Chatterjee as Sattu, one of the bright young students who falls under Rocky\u2019s spell, and Shreya Dhanwanthary as Sattu\u2019s sister Nupur, make an impression.I was also never fully convinced about the ease with which Rocky repeatedly pulled off these big scams. But I suppose that\u2019s creative liberty. This fim takes a lot of those. I\u2019m going with two out of five for Why Cheat India. If anyone\u2019s having trouble sleeping, we might have found a cure.Write your review here:Follow @news18movies for more",
    "https://www.news18.com/cricketnext/news/ipl-2019-kieron-pollard-turns-around-season-with-monstrous-hitting-2096819.html": "Kieron Pollard started his IPL season with scores of 21, 5, 7 and 17* in his first four games. Coming off the back of a poor season in 2018 where he averaged just 19.0 in 9 matches, the West Indian appeared dispensable considering the kind of resources Mumbai Indians had in their wings.\nPollard, though, has changed his season around and how!\nIn the last two matches, we have seen Pollard at his very best. From a game-changing 46* against Sunrisers Hyderabad to help win a low-scoring game to an outrageous 83 on Wednesday night against Kings XI Punjab, Pollard has established his place in the Mumbai Indians middle-order.\nAsked to lead the side in Rohit Sharma\u2019s absence, Pollard chose to step up and lead from the front to seal the run-chase himself. He came in at No. 4 with the Mumbai innings ambling along at leisurely pace. At 56/2 in almost 8 overs, Mumbai needed to get going and soon and Pollard made it happen with some sensational hitting.\nKnowing that the asking rate was creeping up, Pollard wasted little time to go on the attack. He hit Ashwin down the ground for a six and soon launched into Sam Curran whom he hit for two towering sixes and a four in the 12th over.\nEven as wickets kept tumbling at the other end, Pollard reached his half-century off 22 balls with his seventh six in the innings. As many as 42 of his 55 runs had come in sixes and the West Indian appeared determined to take Mumbai across the line.\nIn the penultimate over, he went after Curran yet again and hit him for two more sixes and a four in a 17-run over. Though he was dismissed in the final over for 83 in 31 balls, he had done his bit to bring the equation down to a run-a-ball. A six and a four off the first two balls of the final over nearly took Mumbai home and Alzarri Joseph finished it for them.\nPollard\u2019s 83 included 10 sixes and three fours with 72 of his 83 runs coming in boundaries. This is the second maximum number of runs in boundaries in this season after Johnny Bairstow slammed 90 of his 114 runs in boundaries against RCB.\nPollard\u2019s strike rate of 267.74 is the fourth best strike rate in an innings in the season (minimum 40 runs). His overall strike rate in the season has gone up to 194.56 which is the second best for any batsman this year in the IPL after his countryman, Andre Russell, who has 212.39. Pollard has hit 17 sixes this season which is the third best after Russell and Chris Gayle who have 25 and 18 apiece.\nOn his IPL captaincy debut for Mumbai Indians, Pollard put on a terrific batting display to take his side home in an incredible run-chase. He donned responsibility by walking in at No. 4 and ensured he had done the bulk of the work before walking back.",

The faith that Mumbai showed in the swashbuckling Punjab batsman was partially redeemed when the veteran blazed a 35-balls 53 in their opening IPL-12 tie against Delhi Capitals.\nAlthough Yuvraj\u2019s knock failed to lift his side to a win, his debut performance for Mumbai Indians showed that the fire to perform still burns bright.\n\u201cThe last two years, have been up and down (for me). And I could not decide on what to do,\u201d Yuvraj, who was the top-scorer in Mumbai\u2019s 37-run loss, told the media on Sunday night.\n\u201cI have been speaking to Sachin (Tendulkar) as well and he has gone through that time when he was 37-38-39 (and how he felt). Talking to him makes things easier for me. And I am just playing because I enjoy playing cricket pretty much,\u201d he added.\nYuvraj was released by the Kings XI Punjab last year after scoring just 65 runs in six innings in 2018. This was also his first IPL fifty since scoring 70 not out against the Delhi franchise in the 2017 season.\nThe Punjab southpaw is not prepared to take a call on his cricketing career yet. \u201cWhen the time comes, I will be the first one to hang my boots,\u201d the 37-year-old said.\n\u201cThe main thing for me was why I played the game when I started off. I played the game because I enjoyed playing cricket. When I enjoyed playing cricket, I was not playing for India. I was playing for U-14s and U-16s. So till the time, I enjoy playing cricket, I am going to play,\u201d he added.\nMumbai is Yuvraj\u2019s sixth IPL team after Kings XI Punjab, Pune Warriors, Royal Challengers Bangalore, Delhi Daredevils and Sunrisers Hyderabad. He was pleased to start the new journey with a fifty under her belt.\n\u201cI decided to take my time out there, wickets were falling around me. If I took a chance early we were going to end up wrapping up early. I am happy with the way I was hitting the ball. The most important is winning the game, we\u2019ll learn from the mistakes,\u201d Yuvraj said about his knock on Sunday.\nYuvraj, who has played in 129 IPL games so far for 2705 runs with 13 fifties and strike-rate of 130, was pleased to bat at the crucial No. 4 position for MI.\n\u201cI have been batting No. 4 in last 6-7 years of my career. I have been playing for a long time, so they (MI) know what responsibility to give me. It went well today, hopefully runs will look good if I can win the game for the team,\u201d he said.\nThe MI batsman felt that it was a \u2018180-190\u2019 track at Wankhede and Delhi Capitals\u2019 213 was a match-winning total.\n\u201cLosing Rohit (Sharma) early and the way (Quinton) De Kock was going but got out and then Pollard also was dismissed early, we couldn\u2019t get any partnerships going. It was a 180-190 sort of a wicket. 213 was a match-winning score, Delhi has got a good bowling attack,\u201d he said.\nYuvraj was also full of praise for fellow southpaw Rishabh Pant, who blazed 78 off just 27 balls with seven sixes and seven fours.\n\u201cI can\u2019t comment on (World Cup) selection but Rishabh was outstanding. He had an outstanding season last year as well. He has been playing well in the Test matches, scored two hundreds overseas which shows his talent. It\u2019s important that we groom him well, hopefully he\u2019ll be next big thing for us,\u201d he said about Pant.\nFinally on the young Jammu & Kashmir paceman Rasikh Salam, who made his debut for MI on Sunday at the age of just 17, Yuvraj said, \u201cRasikh the day he came in the nets, everybody was really impressed by him, the way he swung the ball. The confidence that he showed, that\u2019s the reason why guys decided to play him. He swings the ball and got hit for 6 and 4 in the last two balls but apart from that if you see he bowled really well for his first game. He is going to be really special in the next 2-3 years.\u201d",

    "https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/release-time-ozark-season-2-netflix/": "Ozark is arriving on Netflix tonight across the world but because of those pesky time zones, the time of day you\u2019ll be able to start streaming will differ.

Although Netflix has never really stated why it releases titles on Friday, it\u2019s no doubt because it allows you ample time to finish over the weekend when most typically aren\u2019t working.

The series is released at a fixed time in the United States based on Netflix\u2019s head office time which is located in California. As always, once the clock strikes midnight in California, it\u2019ll land on Netflix.\nHere\u2019s a region based table on when Ozark season 2 will be available on Netflix.\nTime Available Timezone Location 00:00 PDT West Coast \u2013 US 01:00 MT Mid-West \u2013 US 02:00 CET Central \u2013 US 03:00 EDT East Coast \u2013 US 09:00/08:00 BST/GMT United Kingdom 17:00 AEST Australia 09:00 CEST Europe 15:00 SGT Singapore\nNote: Release times are subject to change\nCan\u2019t find Ozark season 2 on Netflix?\nYou may need to disconnect and reconnect to Netflix to find the new season.

This Week 3 contest features Miami looking to move to 3-0 on the season, while the Raiders are hoping to avoid an 0-3 start.\nThe Dolphins were last in Hard Rock Stadium in Week 1, when they beat the Tennessee Titans in the longest game ever played in the NFL. The game featured two different lightning delays that pushed the game to over seven hours from kickoff to the final whistle. This week\u2019s game will (hopefully) be shorter than that one, though there are thunderstorms forecasted for the area during the game.\nWe will update the action throughout the game below. You can keep up with everything here, and you can join a live chat with other Dolphins fans by heading over to our live thread.\nFirst Quarter:\nCoin Toss: Dolphins won the toss and deferred to the second half. Raiders will get the ball first.\nRaiders first possession: Robert Quinn and Cameron Wake nearly get to Derek Carr on the first play, with the quarterback just throwing the ball away to avoid a sack. Jordy Nelson caught the short slant on second down and there were no Dolphins players anywhere near him as he took the ball 71 yards to the Miami 14-yard line. After a short run from Marshawn Lynch, Carr looked to Nelson again for the 12-yard touchdown.\nRaiders 7-0.\nDolphins first possession: Ryan Tannehill connected with Kenyan Drake for a one-yard gain on the dump off on first down. Drake then carried the ball out of a two-running back set on second down, picking up three. On 3rd-and-6, Miami looked down the sideline for Kenny Still, but the pass was broken up and Miami punted on the three-and-out.\nRaiders second possession: Weirdness on the punt return, as Matt Haack kicked the ball 59 yards, then as it bounced, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie picked it up and tried to return it, losing one yard down to the Raiders\u2019 eight-yard line. An illegal block in the back penalty added to the play takes the Raiders back to their own four-yard line. Carr then threw a quick pass out to the left with Martavis Bryant, but that was backed up again taking the Raiders to the two-yard line after another block in the back. Lynch was able to bounce outside and break a couple of tackles to pick up nine yards on the run, making it 2nd-and-3. Another Lynch run picked up a yard, giving Oakland a 3rd-and-2 from the Miami 13. A play action fake to Lynch, with a completion to Arami Cooper picked up the first down with a nine-yard gain. Doug Martin got the next first-down carry, picking up four yards. Then, Miami again decided to let Nelson do whatever he wanted, picking up 66 yards and getting the ball all the way down to the Miami yard line. The Raiders got the ball down to the Miami one-yard line, but the Dolphins defense stiffened and held on fourth down.\nDolphins second possession: After offsetting penalties on the fourth-down attempt, Miami started at their own one-yard line. Frank Gore picked up two yards, but a penalty on second down - a penalty that should have been on the Raiders who clearly jumped first but was called on Ja\u2019Wuan James - Miami was backed up to their own two-yard line for second down. Gore picked up no yards on the next play, then Tannehill dropped back into the end zone and could not find anyone, so he scrambled to his left to pick up the first down. After a six-yard pass to Kenny Stills, Drake lost four yards, then Tannehill found DeVante Parker for four yards and the team had to punt.\nRaiders third possession: On first down, Carr rolled to his right, was flushed by Cameron Wake, then stepped up and bombed a ball down the field looking for Cooper. The throw was into triple coverage, and Xavien Howard picked it off, returning it 39 yards.\nDolphins third possession: Miami would do nothing with the ball on the possession, being backed up by a holding penalty on Jakeem Grant on first down. They would pick up just four yards, three on a Drake run and one on a Mike Gesicki reception, before punting.\nRaiders fourth possession: On the punt return, the ball appeared to be about to be downed by Walt Aikens at about the two-yard line when he was shoved in the back and the ball rolled into the end zone. The penalty, however, backed the Raiders up to their own one-yard line, only to have the quarter end on a nine-yard run from Martin.\nEnd 1st Quarter. Raiders 7-0.\nSecond Quarter.\nRaiders fourth possession (continued): On second down after the break, Martin lost two yards with William Hayes making the tackle for a loss. On the third-down play, Hayes then sacked Carr at the Raiders two-yard line, but immediately started grabbing for his knee and was in clear pain. He was able to walk off the field, but was heading straight to the locker room.\nDolphins fourth possession: Miami started with the ball at the Oakland 35 after a short punt from the Raiders. Gore picked up no yards on the first-down run, then added one yard on second down. On 3rd-and-9, Tannehill found Kenny Stills in the back of the end zone for a 34-yard touchdown pass.\nTouchdown!!!\n34 yards Tannehill to Stills!! pic.twitter.com/fvcD7YTck1 \u2014 Kevin Nogle (@thephinsider) September 23, 2018\nTied 7-7.\nRaiders fifth possession: Carr found Nelson for 12 yards, marking the first time the Dolphins did not have to chase Nelson halfway down the field. After an incomplete pass, Bryant was able to pick up four yards on the end-around. Carr was sacked on third down, with Cameron Wake finally getting to the quarterback, only to have Akeem Spence get called for unnecessary roughness after the play, leading to a first-down for the Raiders and Spence\u2019s ejection. The defense tackle appeared to grab a Raiders\u2019 player\u2019s facemark after the play, then when he tripped, he ripped the helmet off the player, then swung it and hit another player. Lynch picked up five yards, then Carr found Jalen Richard for nine yards. Lynch ran the ball the next three plays, picking up 10 total yards, before Carr found Dwayne Harris for seven yards. Martin ran for one yard before Cook picked up 13 yards and pushed to 1st-and-Goal at the Dolphins\u2019 seven-yard line. Lynch picked up five yards to get to the Dolphins\u2019 two, then Carr threw away a pass as he was pressured. After a Miami timeout, the Raiders were called for a false start, backing Oakland back to Miami\u2019s seven-yard line. After no gain on a screen pass to Lynch, the Raiders settled for a field goal.\nRaiders 10-7.\nDolphins fifth possession: Miami started the next drive with a 13-yard slant to Danny Amendola. Tannehill found A.J. Derby on the next play for 16 yards. Then he found Kenny Stills for 21 yards as the clock hit the two-minute warning. The refs decided the drive should be over after that. However, as Tannehill found Wilson for 14-yards, only to have a pancake block from Daniel Kilgore get called for holding. Then, after Gesicki made an incredible grab as he was being cut down from behind, Tannehill found Gore for 12 yards, getting to the Raiders\u2019 13 yard line, but the refs decided that Stills being hit by a linebacker was somehow offensive pass interference and backed up Miami to the Oakland 35. After a sack on Tannehill on 3rd down, Miami punted.\nRaiders sixth possession: Two kneel downs led to halftime.\nHalf-time. Raiders 10-7.\nSign up HERE to take our weekly Dolphins survey.\nThird quarter.\nDolphins receive the ball to start the second half.\nDolphins sixth possession: Miami started the possession with a 10-yard pick up from Albert Wilson, only to have Grant called for Offensive Pass Interference for a replay of the down and a ten-yard loss. Now facing 1st-and-20 at their own 13, Miami saw Gore pick up three yards on a run, then Tannehill could not find anyone open so he dumped it to Drake for six yards. After an incomplete pass, the Dolphins punted.\nRaiders seventh possession: Carr found Cooper for eight yards on the first play. Then looked deep on second down, but dumped it to Lynch for another eight-yard gain. Lynch picked up two yards on the next play, pushing just across midfield and into Miami territory. After a delay of game backed up the Raiders, Carr found Harris for five yards, then Bryant for 11 yards. Martin picked up six yards on a carry on 1st-and-10 from the Miami 39-yard line. Lynch then added five yards, then seven yards. Carr the found Keith Smith for two yards. Lynch lost two yards, but Carr found Richard for 12 yards to set up 1st-and-Goal at the eight. After a replay overturned a touchdown and set up 3rd-and-Goal from inside the one, the Raiders would score on a Lynch leap over the pile.\nRaiders 17-7.\nDolphins seventh possession: Miami found a little rhythm as they got the ball back. Tannehill connected with Amendola for 15 yards on first down, then found Parker for 36 yards down the sideline. After Drake picked up one yard at the Oakland 19-yard line, Tannehill threw a shovel pass to Jakeem Grant who turned the corner and scored the 18-yard touchdown.\nBeautiful shovel pass to Grant who does the work for the score!\npic.twitter.com/D92jfeJugB \u2014 Kevin Nogle (@thephinsider) September 23, 2018\nRaiders 17-14.\nRaiders eighth possession: Carr found Nelson for six yards, but then threw incomplete on second down and saw Xavien Howard break up the third-down pass to Cooper. Oakland punted.\nEnd of third quarter. Raiders 17-14.\nDolphins eighth possession: The Dolphins tried a draw play on first down, but barely got back to the line of scrimmage. On second down, Tannehill found Mike Gesicki for a 19 yard gain. Tannehill looked deep on first down, but the pass to Parker was broken up by Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. Wilson carried the ball on an end-around, but did not pick up any yards. After an offsides penalty on the Raiders moved the ball from 3rd-and-10 to 3rd-and-5, Tannehill was incomplete on a tipped pass intended for Drake and Miami had to punt.\nRaiders ninth possession: The Raiders almost saw their possession disappear as Nelson muffed the punt but Walt Aikens was just a step too far from the ball and Nelson managed to get it back. Lynch then picked up eight yards on first down then three on second down. On the next first down, Carr threw incomplete before Vincent Taylor sacked him for a five-yard loss on second down. On 3rd-and-15, the Fitzpatrick and McTyer were able to hit Bryant short of the first down, but they bounced off each other and the receiver converted the first down with a 19-yard gain. Martin picked up three yards on the next play, followed by no gain for Lynch, then an incomplete pass toward Cooper. Oakland would punt.\nDolphins ninth possession: Tannehill scrambled for 18 yards on first down. Then, on second down, the Dolphins went to the trick plays, with Tannehill handing the ball to Gore, who was coming from the offense\u2019s right to the left. Then Gore flipped the ball to Albert Wilson, who was coming on a sweep, then stopped and threw a pass to Grant, who was wide open down the right side of the field. Miami took their first lead on the 52-yard pass.\nTannehill + Gore + Wilson + Grant = 6! pic.twitter.com/1Pdu1o6irJ \u2014 Kevin Nogle (@thephinsider) September 23, 2018\nDolphins 21-17.\nRaiders tenth possession: Oakland started at their own ten-yard line after an illegal block penalty on the kickoff return. On first down, Carr looked to Bryant, with T.J. McDonald nearly coming away with the interception before the ball hit the ground. On second down, Lynch picked up seven yards, setting up a 3rd-and-3 with Hard Rock Stadium getting loud. Torry McTyer was called for pass interference on the conversion attempt, giving the Raiders a first down. Martin picked up one yard on the first down run. Carr then found Nelson for 16 yards, then, after an incomplete pass, Carr found Mynch for 14 yards. Martin then picked up 15 yards, followed by 6 yards. After a 12-man-on-the-field penalty on Miami, Carr looked deep to the end zone for Bryant, only to have Xavien Howard pick off his second pass of the game.\nDolphins tenth possession: Gore picked up six yards on first down, then Tannehill threw a shovel pass to Albert Wilson, who went 74 yards for the touchdown.\nDolphins 28-17.\nRaiders eleventh possession: Oakland started with a seven yard pass to Richard, then a three yard pass to Cook. A nine yard pass to Richard as then followed by 12 yards to Richard, and ten more to Richard.

    "https://dirtbikemagazine.com/2019-kawasaki-kx450f-unveiled/": "Kawasaki just released its 2019 KX450F, complete with electric start, a redesigned motor, a hydraulic clutch and a coil-spring Showa fork. Here\u2019s what Kawasaki\u2019s PR department says about it:\nThe Kawasaki KX\u2122 lineup has an unmatched history of success and has paved the path to championships for the motocross heroes of today, while continuing to serve as the ultimate tool for the future stars of tomorrow. The KX family is the most dominant motocross and supercross brand of motorcycle available today, led by its flagship model the KX\u2122450. The all-new 2019 KX450 weighs in at 232.4 lbs without fuel while boasting a powerful engine, nimble handling, and technologically advanced features that are derived directly from the motorcycles used by Kawasaki\u2019s factory race team. All-new features for 2019 include a new lightweight, more powerful engine, new slimmer aluminum frame, new Showa coil spring front forks with A-KIT technology, new hydraulic clutch and new electric start system.\nThe KX450 motorcycle is the bike that builds champions. Kawasaki racers also receive the benefit of the industry-leading Team Green\u2122 support network that can be found trackside at events across the nation. The Kawasaki KX450 is notorious for asserting its championship proven dominance across the world.\nThe hydraulic clutch on the new Kawasaki KX450F is the first we\u2019ve seen on a production Japanese bike.\nENGINE\nNEW Kawasaki\u2019s first electric start motocross bike\nNEW hydraulic clutch\nNEW finger-follower valve train designed by Kawasaki\u2019s World Superbike engineers\nNEW aggressive cam profiles\nNEW larger intake and exhaust valves\nNEW lightweight bridged-box piston\nNEW thinner air cleaner element\nNEW downdraft-style intake routing\nNEW longer exhaust header pipe\nNEW larger 44 mm throttle body\nNEW change drum and shift fork reduce weight\nNEW plain bearings for the connecting rod big-end\nNEW compact fuel pump\nThe engine of the KX450 has always been strong, and the lightweight engine package is even stronger in 2019 thanks to the input from the factory race team. The four-stroke, single cylinder, DOHC, water-cooled 449 cc engine has increased peak power and a flatter torque curve that makes it easier to get on the gas sooner.\nNew for 2019, the KX450 becomes Kawasaki\u2019s first motocross bike with an electric start, which is activated by the push of a button located on the handlebar near the right grip making starting easy and convenient. A lightweight, compact Li-ion battery helps keep weight down, as does an automatic centrifugal decompression system fitted to the exhaust cam, which lifts one exhaust valve to facilitate starting.\nIn addition to an electric start, the KX450 also becomes Kawasaki\u2019s first motocross bike equipped with a hydraulic clutch. The new clutch offers a more direct feel and an easier pull for lighter lever action, helping to reduce fatigue while on the racetrack. The hydraulic clutch is designed to provide a more consistent feeling through minimal change in clutch play as the clutch heats up during heavy use.\nKawasaki brought top-level road racing technology to the KX450 valve train, using designs from Kawasaki World Superbike engineers. It uses finger-follower valve actuation, enabling larger-diameter valves and more aggressive cam profiles. Thanks to the finger-follower valve actuation, the rev-limit has been raised, contributing to increased high-rpm performance. The change to finger-follower valve actuation reduces the valve train mass and friction compared to a tappet-style valve actuation. A DLC coating on the finger followers helps protect against wear.\nComplementing more aggressive cams, larger 40 mm intake valves and 33 mm exhaust valves with increased lift help air flow and contribute to increased power. Valves are formed from lightweight titanium, reducing reciprocating weight and offering high-rpm reliability. Chromium steel valve spring retainers and a highly durable chromium nitride coating on the camshafts improve reliability at high-rpm. The lightweight bridged-box piston uses the same design as the Monster Energy\u00ae Kawasaki race team\u2019s factory race bikes, contributing to strong performance throughout the entire rpm range. The revised piston design reduces weight and optimizes strength for durability.\nThe cylinder is offset 8.5 mm forward to reduce mechanical loss through friction from the piston movement, enabling more efficient power generation. A special coating used on the intake port cores during the casting process make ports ultra-smooth, which increases efficiency and performance throughout the rpm range.\nThe new header pipe length has been increased by 105 mm to match the updated engine package and improves low-end power. A resonator chamber fitted to the exhaust system header effectively increases exhaust pipe length and helps reduce the decibel sound level. A new thinner air cleaner element improves air flow, contributing to increased performance at all rpm. New downdraft-style intake routing allows an even straighter approach for intake air into the cylinder, improving cylinder-filling efficiency and contributing to increased engine power. The new 44 mm throttle body is now larger and features reversed orientation of the butterfly for better fuel atomization from the top mounted injector. A new fine atomizing, 12-hole injector now sprays 75 micron droplets and flows over 20 percent more fuel to contribute to increased power, smooth power delivery and superb engine response at partial throttle.\nA close-ratio five-speed transmission features lightweight gears and shafts to keep weight down, yet retain strength, while contributing to the motorcycle\u2019s winning performance. Revisions have been made to the shift drum and shift fork, resulting in a weight savings. The engine cases, which feature a scavenger pump on the right case, have been constructed of extremely light materials and are designed to meet the highest standards of durability. A change from needle bearings to plain bearings for the connecting rod big-end reduces mechanical loss, contributing to overall performance.\nThe new lightweight fuel pump is located in the plastic fuel tank and has a revised design that is more compact, enabling a flatter design for the top of the tank.\nDFI COUPLERS\nNEW Ability to adjust mapping while engine is running\nContributing to the race-winning engine characteristics, the digital fuel injection system of the KX450 features a coupler package that has set the industry standard. Each KX450 motorcycle comes standard with three different couplers, easily allowing riders to select pre-programmed fuel injection and ignition mapping to suit their riding style or track conditions. The four-pin DFI\u00ae couplers select maps that are designed for standard, hard or soft terrain settings. Changing the engine map is as simple as connecting the coupler cap of choice. For riders looking to fine tune their ECU settings, the KX FI Calibration Kit (Handheld) is offered as a Kawasaki Genuine Accessory, and provides access to the fully programmable ECU. The handheld device eliminates the need for a trackside laptop and gives riders the ability to create custom maps for precise adjustment of fuel and ignition settings. The user-friendly device can store up to seven preset maps and is PC-compatible. For 2019, maps can now be changed while the engine is running by changing couplers, eliminating the need to shut off the engine.\nLAUNCH CONTROL\nThe launch control system of the KX450 motorcycle is a favorite for riders who are focused on getting to the first turn ahead of their competition. The push-button activation retards ignition timing in first and second gear, helping maximize traction and put the bike\u2019s potent power to the ground. Once the rider shifts into third gear, normal ignition mapping immediately resumes and full power is restored.\nThe 2019 Kawasaki KX450F frame is said to be narrower and more rigid.\nCHASSIS\nNEW slimmer aluminum perimeter frame\nNEW engine used as a stressed member for rigidity balance\nNEW swingarm with revised rigidity to match the main frame\nKawasaki\u2019s engineering team has worked closely with the factory racing team to develop an industry-leading slim aluminum perimeter frame that is capable of providing precise cornering through excellent front-end feel and the ultimate agility at high speeds. As an evolution of the current design, the new frame boasts increased overall rigidity balance. The frame\u2019s lightweight construction is composed of forged, extruded and cast parts, while the engine is used as a stressed member and adds to the frames rigidity balance. The overall rigidity balance has been increased through a new steering head area with optimized rigidity, main frame rails with revised cross-section, and a revised line for the swingarm brackets. Lower frame rails have been widened and also contribute to the bikes overall rigidity balance. Forged chain adjusters are also equipped with a self-locking rear axle nut. The axle nut holds 80 lb-ft torque without the need of a cotter pin, simplifying maintenance at the track.\nThe KX450 motorcycle also features a new lightweight swingarm that has revised rigidity and was designed to match the frame, and contributes to increased traction at the rear wheel. The alloy swingarm is constructed of a cast front section and twin tapered hydro-formed spars in a raw aluminum finish. With center of gravity and balanced handling in mind, engineers carefully placed the dimension of the swingarm pivot, output sprocket, and rear axle locations, so that the rear tire would drive the bike forward.\nSUSPENSION & BRAKES\nNEW Showa 49 mm coil spring fork with A-KIT technology\nNEW revised linkage ratios\nNEW rear shock layout and Uni-Trak\u00ae rear suspension\nNEW front brake master cylinder\nNEW larger 250 mm rear disc\nNEW rear brake master cylinder and hose\nNEW larger-diameter 22 mm front axle\nFor 2019, the KX450 motorcycle is equipped with new high-performance Showa 49 mm coil spring front forks with A-KIT technology, which feature large diameter inner tubes that are the same size as those found on Kawasaki\u2019s factory racing team\u2019s bikes and enable the use of large damping pistons for smooth action and firm damping. A hard titanium coating on the outer surface of the fork inner tubes helps prevent wear abrasion. The increased surface hardness of the dark navy blue coating also helps to prevent scratches and damage to the tubes. As a result of the surface remaining smoother for a longer period, the reduction of friction creates a smoother and more enjoyable ride. A Showa \u201cDimplush\u2122\u201d finish process plus Kashima Coat creates a micro-dimpled surface on the inner walls of the outer fork tubes to improve oil retention, and helps prevent wear abrasion on the inside of the tubes, ensuring the sliding surfaces remain smooth for a long time, while the outside is protected against corrosion. The A-KIT technology used in valving, surface treatments and finishes, contributes to noticeably smoother suspension action at the initial part of the stroke and a better ride feel. Incredibly precise personalized settings can be found with 16-position compression and 16-position rebound adjustments.\nOn the rear suspension, a new Kawasaki Uni-Trak\u00ae linkage system is designed to work in conjunction with the new shock, new aluminum frame and new swingarm. The linkage, which is mounted below the swingarm, allows for a longer rear suspension stroke and allows more precise rear suspension tuning. The linkage ratios have been revised to help keep the rear wheel planted for increased traction. The Showa shock layout has been shifted 5 mm to the right to allow room for the new downdraft-style engine intake and increases rear wheel traction. The new Showa Compact Design rear shock has A-KIT technology with bigger diameter compression adjuster, improving damping on the high frequency movements found on today\u2019s motocross tracks. Dual compression adjustability can be found on the rear shock, allowing high-speed and low-speed damping to be adjusted separately. The fully adjustable shock allows for settings to be personalized for riding preference and conditions.\nAn oversized 270 mm, petal-shaped front brake rotor from the renowned manufacturer, Braking, is fitted to keep up with the powerful engine of the KX450 and help riders brake harder and later than the competition. The front brake master cylinder has been revised and offers better initial control, while contributing to overall braking performance and consistency. The rear is equipped with a new larger-diameter 250 mm petal-shaped Braking\u00ae rotor that matches the large front disc and contributes to stronger stopping power. The rear brake master cylinder and hose have been revised to reduce weight.\nDerived from Kawasaki\u2019s factory racing efforts, front-end traction has been improved thanks to a new larger-diameter 22 mm front axle shaft. Dunlop MX3S tires contribute to increased front and rear traction.\nADJUSTABILITY\nNEW lighter and wider footpegs\nKawasaki continues its unmatched commitment towards providing riders with class-leading ERGO-FIT\u2122 comfort thanks to its adjustable handlebar mounting system and footpegs to fit a variety of riders and riding styles. The handlebars feature four-way adjustable mounts. The multi-position handlebars offer two mounting holes with 35 mm of adjustability, and the 180-degree offset clamps boast four individual settings to suit different size riders. The new lighter footpegs are 5 mm wider and positioned 3 mm further rearward, offering excellent grip and making it easier to weight the pegs. The footpegs feature dual-position mounting points, with a lower position that reduces the standard setting by an additional 5 mm. The lower position effectively lowers the center of gravity when standing, and reduces knee angle when taller riders are seated.\nBODYWORK & SEAT\nNEW bodywork designed to facilitate rider movement\nNEW slimmer single piece radiator shrouds\nNEW flatter and lower fuel tank\nNEW smooth engine covers\nComplementing its championship proven technology, the 2019 KX450 motorcycle features aggressive styling along with in-mold graphics on the radiator shrouds that result in an ultra-smooth surface and racy look needed to finish at the top of its class. The sleek bodywork has been molded to match the V-mounted radiators and narrow chassis design. The flatter fuel tank design allows the tip of the seat to be 20 mm lower and gives the rider greater freedom of movement when changing riding position, and facilitates sitting farther forward.\nEach piece of bodywork has been designed to help facilitate rider movement with long, smooth surfaces that make it easy to slide back and forth. New single piece shrouds are slimmer where they come to contact with the rider\u2019s legs and are easier to hold on to. Seams between the shrouds, seat, and side covers are nearly flush in order to increase bike control as well as moving around on the motorcycle.\nAdding to the distinctive Kawasaki factory race team look is a green oil cap, generator cover plugs, green alumite suspension adjusters, and black alumite wheels. Engine covers were designed to be smooth in order to not impede rider movement.\nThe 2019 Kawasaki KX450 motorcycle can easily be made to suit a large range of riders thanks to its flat seat design, adjustable handlebar and footpegs and adjustable suspension components. This perfectly complements the wide range of damping settings as well as the DFI couplers and optional handheld KX FI Calibration Kit, allowing the rider to find the ideal engine characteristics to suit a particular track or conditions. While the base settings on the KX450 motorcycle are based on extensive testing and racing, the motorcycle provides a huge range of technology and adjustment to help ensure every rider can experience the incredible ability of this extremely capable motocross bike.\nCONTINGENCY\nKawasaki Team Green Racing Contingency for 2019 supercross, motocross, and off-road racing are set to be announced and include the all-new KX450. Highlights of the contingency program include increased payouts in off-road racing and more privateer support in both supercross and motocross.\nColor: Lime Green\nMSRP: $9299\nAvailability: Now\nwww.kawasaki.com.",

    "https://news.wttw.com/2019/05/17/expert-fetal-abduction-rare-yet-endures-over-30-years": "DETROIT (AP) \u2014 The grisly act is rare, yet it's common enough to have a name: fetal abduction.\nThanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors\nThe latest case out of Chicago \u2014 in which 19-year-old Marlen Ochoa-Lopez was strangled and her baby cut from her womb \u2014 has similarities to many of the roughly 30 similar crimes carried out over the last three decades across the U.S., an expert said.\nOf the roughly 30 documented fetal abduction cases between 1987 and 2015, most of the mothers were slain and it\u2019s typical for them to have been stalked or lured somewhere under false pretenses \u2014 including for free supplies, according to Kenna Quinet, an associate criminal justice professor at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. In Ochoa-Lopez's case, police and family members say she was killed after responding to a Facebook offer of free baby clothes. Her infant son is hospitalized in grave condition and is not expected to survive.\nQuinet, who co-authored the homicide textbook \u201cThe Will to Kill: Making Sense of Senseless Murder,\u201d said it\u2019s as illogical as it is horrific: She\u2019s unaware of any case of \u201cmurder by C-section,\u201d as she describes it, in which the baby wasn\u2019t found and the crime wasn\u2019t discovered.\n\u201cClearly, you\u2019re not getting away with this,\u201d she said. \u201cThese women are clearly delusional.\u201d\nAuthorities charged a Chicago woman on Thursday with murder for allegedly strangling 19-year-old Marlen Ochoa-Lopez with a cord and cutting an infant from her womb. Clarisa Figueroa, 46, apparently wanted to raise another child two years after her adult son died of natural causes, investigators said.\nFigueroa\u2019s 24-year-old daughter, Desiree Figueroa, also was charged with murder. Her boyfriend, 40-year-old Piotr Bobak, was charged with concealment of a homicide.\nQuinet said it\u2019s most often a case of a perpetrator making \u201can extremely dysfunctional, controlling, psychotic attempt to keep a man in a relationship,\u201d or they\u2019re suffering from what Quinet calls \u201cmotherhood by proxy.\u201d That\u2019s also the name of a section in her book and a play on Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a form of abuse where the person supposed to care for the individual makes up or causes the condition.\nThe cases come along an average of once a year, with some gaps. It\u2019s even occurred before in Chicago, in 1995. That nearly full-term baby survived, but the mother, Debra Evans, and two of her other children were killed. Three people were convicted.\nQuinet\u2019s research shows that most babies survive, but far fewer of their mothers do. She found eight women who did, including one who escaped and killed the woman trying to kill her and take the baby.\nQuinet said she can\u2019t find a definitive case before 1987. She said that correlates to a time in which hospitals boosted their security, significantly decreasing the number of newborns stolen from maternity wards or neo-natal units.\nWhile fetal abduction endures, she said it\u2019s important to note that it remains infrequent and shows no sign of increasing.\n\u201cIf you consider an extremely rare event of the millions of women a year who are pregnant, there would be no way as individual people that we could take this risk to zero,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s as low as we can hope for it to be.\u201d\nRelated stories:\nPolice: 3 Charged in Murder of Pregnant Teen Marlen Ochoa-Lopez\nPregnant Chicago Woman Slain, Baby Cut From Her Womb\nChicago Police Offer First Look at 2019 Summer Safety Strategies\nThanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors",

Football is back in Steelers Nation and all is well. After a tumultuous wait for our beloved Steelers to be back, they return tonight as they face their in-state rivals. the Philadelphia Eagles. The Steelers are coming off one of the most disappointing losses in recent memory when they lost to Blake Bortles and the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2017 AFC Playoffs.\nNow it is time to see some of the progress and tools which will be at the Steelers\u2019 disposal this season. While only one preseason game, the Steelers will still need to show they have made progress to possibly winning a championship. Given the state of Le\u2019Veon Bell\u2019s contract, this could be possibly be the final year of their championship window, but it seems tonight we will be looking more so into the future, especially with Mason Rudolph expecting to get significant snaps.\nHere are my three things to look for in tonight\u2019s preseason action:\nMason Rudolph\u2019s and Joshua Dobbs \u2019 Progress\nThis is going to be an exciting time for the Steelers as we watch potentially the next franchise Quarterback of the Steelers take the field for the first time.\nBy all accounts. Rudolph has impressed at camp and Kevin Colbert said he was much further along than they actually thought. His progressions and reads have been better by the sound of it and if he shows growth from his college-self this will be a very exciting time to be a Steelers fan.\nJosh Dobbs, on the other hand, has had a pretty rough training camp. He did this last year as well, but showed flashes in the preseason, where he led a few clutch drives, as well as showing his arm off a few times. The Steelers will want to see notable progress from him if he is going to supplant Landry Jones.\nRudolph and Dobbs together are an intriguing duo. Ben Roethlisberger is not playing and we already know what Landry Jones is capable of, but if Dobbs and Rudolph show up, Jones could be out of a job. While I do not consider it likely right now, I do believe there is an outside chance Dobbs and Rudolph do in fact perform well enough Jones is released by the Steelers.\nRudolph and Dobbs both need a lot of work, but with them being young, potential-filled players, you have to find it intriguing. Both had trouble processing the whole field coming out of college, and so against a defense that likes to run exotic looks even in vanilla defense, this is a good test for the young quarterbacks.\nDobbs has to show growth, though. If he does not show any poise in the pocket, ability to improve his ball placement, or show his processing has improved, he may very well prove he was a wasted pick last year by Kevin Colbert.\nThe Safeties\nOther than linebacker, the secondary is a place of intrigue, and yet fear for Steelers fans. Free agent acquisition Morgan Burnett will be looking to impress in a variety of roles as he makes his debut with the Steelers. Rookies Terrell Edmunds and Marcus Allen will also look to have a big impact and prove that they were indeed the correct picks.\nEdmunds, in particular, has to show he has improved on his processing and pursuit angles. By the sounds from camp, both have been true, as he has made a ton of great plays this camp alone, seemingly being the player the Steelers have needed. Allen has to show he can cover at least modestly well. We all know he is a great run defender, but he also has to show he is not a complete liability in coverage\nSean Davis will be playing in his first game as a true Free Safety. He has to show not only is his range a big addition the defense, but he has improved on his tackling. Davis has a knack for getting his nose around the football, he even led the team in tackles last season, but he has to show he can finish the play. Davis led the team in missed tackles last year, and if he can put things together at free safety, the Steelers instantly become a much better defense.\nSleeper Malik Golden will also be looking to impress and perhaps steal a roster spot. He had a great preseason and a good training camp last season until a groin injury ended his hopes of possibly making the roster. He has continued to have a decent camp and can perhaps be a welcome addition to the team as a whole.\nThe Enigma of Jaylen Samuels\nOne of the most versatile, and yet peculiar picks in this draft was Jaylen Samuels. He has so many possible uses in this offense. He can be used as a running back, slot receiver, outside receiver, tight end, H-Back, and fullback.\nThus, it is going to be an interesting story to watch how they use Samuels in today\u2019s game. From the reports out of camp, expect him to be used at running back, slot receiver, and H-back, especially with Vance McDonald being out with a foot injury.\nRandy Fichtner\u2019s scheme calls for exotic plays and versatile players. This is why they drafted Jaylen Samuels. Samuels has a real shot to be a difference maker, and it sounds like he has thus far.\nIt is very likely we will not actually get the full view of just how Samuels will be used, but we will at least get an idea of how he will be used this season. We may see some two running back sets with James Conner very early on in the game. Regardless of how he is used this game, Samuels will be a player to watch, as he very easily can exploit defenses with his versatility.",

He was often seen as close to the Saudi government and counted on to champion its policies and ignore its scandals and abuses. At times, he served as both an official and unofficial adviser to senior Saudi officials.\nBut last year, as many of his friends were arrested and the already limited margins of freedom of expression inside the kingdom shrank, Mr. Khashoggi went into voluntary exile, dividing his time between the Washington, D.C., area, London and Istanbul and publishing articles that criticized the increasingly authoritarian rule of Crown Prince Mohammed. He frequently wrote op-ed columns for The Washington Post.\nThose articles turned him into a pariah with the Saudi government and the defenders of Crown Prince Mohammed, who accused him of receiving cash from foreign governments to tarnish the kingdom\u2019s reputation.\nMr. Khashoggi\u2019s wife had remained in Saudi Arabia while he was no longer able to return freely.

It came 11 days after The New York Times reported the degree to which Mr. McGahn \u2014 who was by Mr. Trump\u2019s side at major moments as the president sought to keep control of the Russia inquiry \u2014 has emerged as a key witness in the investigation. Over the past nine months Mr. McGahn has given 30 hours of testimony in at least three voluntary interviews.\nMr. McGahn\u2019s departure leaves the White House without one of the few senior advisers who have been willing to push back against Mr. Trump. It also raised the prospect of further West Wing exits, particularly in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office, where Mr. McGahn has had a loyal staff, with several people staying in their jobs out of devotion to him.\nMr. McGahn had long discussed his intention to leave at some point, but the way Mr. Trump blindsided him with a tweet underscored how dysfunctional the relationship had become, even as the Russia inquiry appears to be reaching a critical phase, and the legal scrutiny is mounting for the president.",

Gerald Ford wrote in 2005 that he was prepared to let \u201chistory\u2019s judgment\u201d of his presidency rest exclusively on his decision in 1975 to nominate Stevens. Barack Obama scrawled his endorsement on a birthday note to Stevens in 2014 \u2014 \u201cWe miss you on the Court!\u201d\nThe cross-party embrace of Stevens by these two presidents shows the distance to the right the Republican Party has traveled from Ford to Trump far more than Stevens\u2019s own shift in the opposite direction. He was the last of a group of Republican appointees (Earl Warren, William Brennan, Harry Blackmun, David Souter and, to a degree, Sandra Day O\u2019Connor) who breathed compassion into the law and put the impact of their decisions on real people above arid theories. In one of his last judicial opinions, Stevens wrote that his approach to interpreting the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of liberty \u201cis guided by history but not beholden to it.\u201d He described his willingness to \u201cprotect some rights even if they have not already received uniform protection from the elected branches.\u201d And crucially he argued that no method can separate the beliefs of individual judges from the work of the court. \u201cIt all depends on judges\u2019 exercising careful, reasoned judgment,\u201d Stevens wrote. \u201cAs it always has, and as it always will.\u201d\n[ John Paul Stevens has died. Read our obituary here. ]\nClues to how Stevens arrived at that conclusion are sprinkled through \u201cThe Making of a Justice,\u201d but only if you dig for them. Stevens\u2019s new book (the third since his retirement in 2010) is more catalog than sustained argument. It suffers from the burden of completism and the frustration of muffled drama. In 1933, when Stevens was 12, his father was charged with embezzlement, and a group of armed robbers who thought he\u2019d hidden $1 million in tomato cans burst into the family\u2019s house one evening. But Stevens plays down the effects. \u201cI do not recall any special fear for our safety during the ensuing months in that year,\u201d he writes.\nTurning to his time as a justice, he devotes a chapter each to his 36 terms on the court. To follow the intellectual arc from one decision to a later one that relates to it, you have to read a lot of pages. Which, come to think of it, is probably what it feels like to do the work of a Supreme Court justice.",

And my two male friends who were allegedly there, who knew me well, have told this committee under penalty of felony that they don\u2019t recall any such party and I never did or never would do anything like this.\nDr. Ford\u2019s allegation is not merely uncorroborated, it is refuted by the very people she says were there, including by a longtime friend of hers. Refuted. Third, Dr. Ford has said that this event occurred at a house near Columbia Country Club, which is at the corner of Connecticut Avenue and East West highway in Chevy Chase, Md. In her letter to Senator Feinstein, she said there were four other people at the house. But none of those people, nor I, lived near Columbia Country Club. As of the summer of 1982, Dr. Ford was 15 and could not drive yet. And she did not live near Columbia Country Club. She says confidently that she had one beer at the party. But she does not say how she got to the house in question or how she got home or whose house it was.\nFourth, I have submitted to this committee detailed calendars recording my activities in the summer of 1982. Why did I keep calendars? My dad started keeping detailed calendars of his life in 1978. He did so as both a calendar and a diary. He\u2019s a very organized guy, to put it mildly. Christmastime, we sat around and he would tell old stories. Old milestones, old weddings, old events from his calendars.\nIn ninth grade \u2014 in ninth grade in 1980, I started keeping calendars of my own. For me also, it\u2019s both a calendar and a diary. I\u2019ve kept such calendar diaries for the last 38 years. Mine are not as good as my dad\u2019s, in some years, and when I was a kid, the calendars are about what you would expect from a kid. Some goofy parts, some embarrassing parts. But I did have the summer of 1982 documented pretty well.\nThe event described by Dr. Ford presumably happened on a weekend because I believe everyone worked and had jobs in the summers. In any event, a drunken early evening event of the kind she describes presumably happened on a weekend. If it was a weekend, my calendars show that I was out of town almost every weekend night before football training camp started in late August. The only weekend nights that I was in D.C. were Friday, June 4, when I was with my dad at a pro-golf tournament and had my high school achievement test at 8:30 the next morning. I also was in D.C. on Saturday night, Aug. 7, but I was at a small gathering at Becky\u2019s house in Rockville with Matt, Denise, Lori and Jenny. Their names are all listed on my calendar. I won\u2019t use their last names here. And then on the weekend of Aug. 20 to 22, I was staying at the Garretts\u2019 with Pat and Chris as we did final preparations for football training camp that began on Sunday the 22nd.\nAs the calendars confirm, that weekend before a brutal football training camp schedule was no time for parties. So let me emphasize this point: If the party described by Dr. Ford happened in the summer of 1982 on a weekend night, my calendar shows all but definitively I was not there. During the weekdays in the summer of 1982, as you can see, I was out of town for two weeks of the summer for a trip to the beach with friends and at the legendary five-star basketball camp in Honesdale, Pa.\nWhen I was in town, I spent much of my time working, working out, lifting weights, playing basketball or hanging out and having some beers with friends as we talked about life and football and school and girls. Some have noticed I didn\u2019t have church on Sundays on my calendars. I also didn\u2019t list brushing my teeth and for me, going to church on Sundays was like brushing my teeth. Automatic. Still is.",

With a 5-4 vote, the court wrote in its opinion that the order is \"squarely within the scope of Presidential authority.\"\nThe 5-4 decision Tuesday is the court's first substantive ruling on a Trump administration policy. The president reacted to news of the ruling, tweeting \"Wow!\"\nSUPREME COURT UPHOLDS TRUMP TRAVEL BAN. Wow! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2018\nMr. Trump later hailed the ruling as a \"tremendous victory for the American People and the Constitution.\"\nIn a statement issued by the White House, he said, \"This ruling is also a moment of profound vindication following months of hysterical commentary from the media and Democratic politicians who refuse to do what it takes to secure our border and our country. As long as I am President, I will defend the sovereignty, safety, and security of the American People, and fight for an immigration system that serves the national interests of the United States and its citizens.\"\nMeanwhile, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the ruling was \"critical to ensuring the continued authority of President Trump -- and all future presidents -- to protect the American people.\"\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion, joined by his four conservative colleagues. Roberts wrote that presidents have substantial power to regulate immigration. \"The sole prerequisite,\" Roberts wrote, is \"that the entry of the covered aliens 'would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.' The President has undoubtedly fulfilled that requirement here.\" Roberts pointed out that Mr. Trump had ordered an evaluation of every country's compliance with the risk assessment baseline and then issued the findings.\n\"Based on that review, he found that restricting entry of aliens who could not be vetted with adequate information was in the national interest,\" Roberts wrote.\nRoberts also rejected the challengers' claim of anti-Muslim bias. But he was careful not to endorse either Trump's provocative statements about immigration in general and Muslims in particular.\n\"We express no view on the soundness of the policy,\" Roberts wrote.\nHowever, CBS News' Jan Crawford cautioned on CBSN that it \"would be a mistake to read this ruling as, Trump can say whatever he wants.\" The next case, the next issue -- perhaps Russia -- is a different case, and he could make remarks that could show insight into a different area of law.\nThe court may have signaled its eventual approval in December, when the justices allowed the policy to take full effect even as the court fight continued and lower courts had ruled it out of bounds.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent that based on the evidence in the case \"a reasonable observer would conclude that the Proclamation was motivated by anti-Muslim animus.\" She said her colleagues arrived at the opposite result by \"ignoring the facts, misconstruing our legal precedent, and turning a blind eye to the pain and suffering the Proclamation inflicts upon countless families and individuals, many of whom are United States citizens.\"\nJustices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan also dissented.\nIn a tweet from the ACLU, the advocacy group said \"this is not the first time the Court has been wrong, or has allowed official racism and xenophobia to continue rather than standing up to it.\"\nThey added, \"History has its eyes on us -- and will judge today's decision harshly.\"\nBREAKING: SCOTUS has upheld Trump\u2019s Muslim ban. This is not the first time the Court has been wrong, or has allowed official racism and xenophobia to continue rather than standing up to it.\nHistory has its eyes on us \u2014 and will judge today\u2019s decision harshly. #NoMuslimBanEver \u2014 ACLU (@ACLU) June 26, 2018\nRyan Mace of Amnesty International USA said in a statement following the ruling that the policy is \"a catastrophe all around.\"\n\"Some of the people banned from this policy are fleeing conflicts that the United States has had a direct hand in creating or perpetuating, as is the case in Yemen and Syria. In those cases especially we are essentially lighting a house on fire and locking the escape door shut. This ban, and the anti-Muslim sentiment in which it originated, has no place in a country that claims to value human rights,\" Mace added.\nNihad Awad, Executive Director of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), said at a press conference that the Court's ruling was \"extremely disappointing\" to Muslims and \"all people who believe in equal protection and equality.\"\nAwad said the ruling now gives the Trump administration a \"free hand to re-inject discrimination against a particular faith back into our immigration system.\"\nCBS News\nRead the opinion here:\nTravel ban arguments\nIn April, Mr. Trump appeared likely to win his argument when the case was heard by the high court. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy both signaled support for the travel policy in arguments. The ban's challengers almost certainly needed one of those two justices in order to strike down the ban on travelers from several mostly Muslim countries.\nThe justices voted in December to allow the policy to take full effect pending their full consideration.\nThe Trump administration asked the court to reverse lower court rulings that would strike down the ban.\nThe Supreme Court also considered whether the president can indefinitely keep people out of the country based on nationality, and it also looked at whether the policy is aimed at excluding Muslims from the United States.\nKennedy challenged lawyer Neal Katyal, representing the challengers, about whether the ban would be unending. He said the policy's call for a report every six months \"indicates there'll be a reassessment\" from time to time.\nThe travel ban was the first Trump policy to undergo a full-blown Supreme Court review. The justices examined the third version of a policy that Mr. Trump first rolled out a week after taking office, triggering chaos and protests across the U.S. as travelers were stopped from boarding international flights and detained at airports for hours. The first version was blocked by courts and withdrawn. Its replacement was allowed to take partial effect, but expired in September.\nThe current version is indefinite and now applies to travelers from five countries with overwhelmingly Muslim populations \u2014 Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. It also affects two non-Muslim countries, blocking travelers from North Korea and some Venezuelan government officials and their families. A sixth majority-Muslim country, Chad, was removed from the list in April after improving \"its identity-management and information sharing practices,\" Mr. Trump said in a proclamation.\nThe administration argued that courts have no role to play because the president has broad powers over immigration and national security, and foreigners have no right to enter the country.\nThe challengers argued that his policy amounts to the Muslim ban that Mr. Trump called for as a candidate, violating the Constitution's prohibition against religious bias.",

    "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sweeping-lawsuit-accuses-top-generic-drug-companies-executives-of-fixing-prices-60-minutes-2019-05-12/": "It might be the biggest price-fixing scheme in U.S. history. On Friday, Connecticut and a coalition of more than 40 states filed a 500-page lawsuit accusing the biggest generic drug makers of a massive, systematic conspiracy to bilk consumers out of billions of dollars. It's a more sweeping version of a similar lawsuit the states filed in 2016 that's still being litigated. The generic industry vehemently denies the allegations.\nCongress established the current generic industry in 1984 to push prices down. The idea was that once patents on brand name drugs expired, generic makers would compete to make drugs more affordable. But 1,215 generics, many of them the most prescribed drugs, jumped on average more than 400 percent in a single year.\nConnecticut has been examining the generic drug industry for almost five years. Tonight, we'll take you inside its investigation and show you how two dogged attorneys built the cases the state attorney general calls the most egregious examples of corporate greed he has ever seen.\nWilliam Tong\nWilliam Tong: It's an industry-wide conspiracy. And I think it answers one of the biggest questions all of us are asking, which is why are prescription drugs so expensive? And I think we know why now. Because the prices of generic drugs are fixed. And there's a widespread conspiracy to rig the market.\nConnecticut Attorney General William Tong says his office found evidence of price fixing by dozens of generic drug industry sales directors, marketers, CEOs dating back to 2006.\nBill Whitaker: How many drugs are we talking about?\nWilliam Tong: Hundreds. Hundreds of drugs.\nBill Whitaker: What kinds of drugs?\nWilliam Tong: Every kind of drug that touches our everyday lives. I'll give you an example, Bill. This is my bottle of doxycycline. It is a common antibiotic that I take every day for a skin condition. And there is a conspiracy around doxycycline. And so sitting here today as the attorney general of the state of Connecticut, I'm one of the victims.\nBetween 2013 and 2014, a bottle of doxycycline shot up 8,281 percent from $20 to more than $1800. A bottle of asthma medication, albuterol sulfate, jumped more than 4000 percent, from $11 to $434. Pravastatin, a cholesterol drug, up more than 500 percent, from $27 a bottle to $196.\nThe sudden price spikes caught the attention of Congress, which called a hearing; the Department of Justice, which launched an investigation; and the state of Connecticut, which now has filed two lawsuits.\nWilliam Tong: This is a phased approach And we're focusing on all the major players.\nBill Whitaker: So is it your contention that these companies are putting Americans' lives at risk?\nWilliam Tong: Yes, you know, it's $100 billion market. We're talking about the drugs that America takes every day to live. And they're profiteering off of that in a highly illegal way. They're just taking advantage.\nBill Whitaker: The industry says that the prices went up because of market forces and because of drug shortages. These explanations don't wash with you?\nWilliam Tong: No. I mean they've said this to me to my face. And\u2014\nBill Whitaker: Why don't you believe that?\nWilliam Tong: Because we have evidence, hard evidence, in the form of text messages, emails, documents, witnesses that demonstrate clearly that it wasn't about product shortages. It was about profit. It was about cold, hard greed.\nCorrespondent Bill Whitaker with Joe Nielsen and Mike Cole\nHow can he say that? Because of what these two sleuth attorneys uncovered. Mike Cole heads the antitrust division in the Connecticut Attorney General's office. Joe Nielsen is his lead prosecutor on this case. They've worked together for more than a decade reaching multi-million dollar settlements with big names like Apple and Bank of America. This, they say, is their biggest case yet.\nMichael Cole: This particular industry \u2014 the generic drug industry \u2014 touches everybody.\nJoe Nielsen: 90 percent of all prescriptions filled in this country are filled with generic drugs.\nIn the summer of 2014, Cole and Nielsen spotted a newspaper article about a sharp rise in the price of a decades-old generic heart medication called digoxin.\nBill Whitaker: So you read the article and something just didn't smell right?\nMichael Cole: I guess you could say you get a little bit of a sixth sense after you do this type of work for a long period of time which we both have. So we did a little bit more due diligence. And we sent out three subpoenas.\nBill Whitaker: What did you think you would find?\nMichael Cole: We were looking for communications amongst competitors. When you do this kind of work it's really not one hot document, as they say, that's gonna prove a case. It's kind of like putting together a puzzle, a piece at a time.\nThe puzzle grew into a monster. Three subpoenas turned into more than 300 to major generic drug companies, dozens of employees and phone companies. Over the course of the investigation, the subpoenas generated almost 19 million internal documents and phone records. There were so many pieces, Joe Nielsen couldn't make out the big picture at first. For more than two years, he was the only one working the case. He spent days at his office desk and many nights at his dining room table looking for patterns. He eventually bought software used by law enforcement to investigate drug cartels, so he could analyze nearly 12 million phone logs.\nBill Whitaker: And this allowed you to do what?\nJoe Nielsen: Well, this allows you within five minutes to look at someone's entire phone records and see the history of who they communicated with, when.\nNielsen saw a picture emerge of a cozy relationship among industry competitors with lots of phone chatter right before they increased prices apparently in lock step.\nJoe Nielsen: You know, we can see that competitor A is talking to competitor B five times on one day. And what that allows us to do is to go into our document database and look on that day at what they were saying.\nIt all snapped into sharp focus when he matched phone logs to thousands of text messages from Heritage Pharmaceuticals. Nielsen says this exchange, with competitor Citron Pharma, showed collusion to increase the price of a diabetes medication. The text messages implicate two other companies: Aurobindo and Teva, the world's largest generic drug maker. The national accounts manager at Heritage wrote:\nA.S.: \"We are raising the price right now \u2014 just letting you know, Teva says they will follow\"\nA.S.: \"Aurobindo agrees too\"\nA corporate account representative from Citron answered:\nKA: \"...we are def [initely] in to raise pricing ... are doing this immediately\"\nThe Heritage executive responded:\nAS: \"We are raising our customers 200% over current market price.\"\nBill Whitaker: So what's wrong with these companies talking to each other?\nJoe Nielsen: If they were talking about\u2014 their families or, you know, a barbecue that they went to, there would be nothing wrong with it. But when they talk about raising prices and they agree to do that then it's completely and totally illegal.\nTake the case of the antifungal drug Nystatin. As you can see with this graph, the price held steady at $68 a bottle for years, but in April 2013 Sun Pharmaceuticals almost doubled the price to $131. Right after the increase there was this flurry of phone calls between Sun and competitors, Heritage and Teva.\nJoe Nielsen: So you see a phone call between Heritage and Sun pharmaceuticals lasting over 45 minutes.\nAfter dozens of calls like this, first Teva, then Heritage followed Sun's lead and jacked up the price of Nystatin to $142 a bottle. Joe Nielsen also found messages that seemed to show companies, including Pfizer, conspiring to divvy up the market for other drugs. The lawsuit filed Friday states: \"Pfizer, acting through its wholly-owned subsidiary and alter ego... Greenstone, entered into agreements with Teva and... other competitors to allocate and divide customers and markets... and to fix and raise prices.\" It refers to this email from Teva as evidence.\n\"[T]ell Greenstone we are playing nice in the sandbox and we will let them have [the \u2026 customer].\"\nBill Whitaker: Play nice in the sandbox. What does that mean?\nJoe Nielsen: Avoid competing with each other, take your fair share and don't go after anything more than that. Keep the prices as high as you can.\nBill Whitaker: But I thought the whole point of generic drugs was to have competition and keep the price down?\nJoe Nielsen: That's the point for us, but that's what the companies who are selling the generic drugs want to avoid.\nWilliam Tong: I think what we've come upon is that the generic drug industry is the largest private sector corporate cartel in history.\nBill Whitaker: What is the effect of that on you? Me? Average consumer?\nWilliam Tong: It's devastating. it affects health insurance premiums and health insurance plans. It impacts Medicare and Medicaid. And it is a chain reaction that drives up the price of American healthcare to unnatural heights.\nWe reached out to the companies mentioned in our report for comment. Pfizer, which advertises on this broadcast, denies any wrongdoing and says it has cooperated with the Connecticut Attorney General. It says its subsidiary, Greenstone, intends to vigorously fight the claims. Sun issued this statement: \"Sun Pharma is committed to the highest level of ethics and integrity... We believe the allegations made in these lawsuits are without merit and we will continue to vigorously defend against them.\"\nIn court filings Sun and other drug makers have argued there's no proof of an overarching conspiracy. The industry trade group told us generic prices declined three straight years from 2016.\nWilliam Tong: There has been some leveling off. But I don't think that means that the conspiracy has ended. They're still unnaturally high. What we haven't seen is if they stopped colluding you would expect prices to go down dramatically. You would expect competition to ensue and one competitor would go after another. And they'd start undercutting each other on price. That hasn't happened.\nDr. Thomas Pliura\nBill Whitaker: Are you seeing patients today?\nDr. Thomas Pliura: I am.\nDr. Tom Pliura is feeling the impact of rising generic drug prices. He runs a clinic that serves 14,000 people in rural, southern Illinois. This is a federally designated, \"health care shortage area,\" which is a bureaucratic way of saying there aren't enough doctors around here.\nThree quarters of his patients are on Medicare or Medicaid. Both government programs set limits on reimbursements for drugs. The rising generic prices have created a medical emergency for him. Since the government won't cover the increased costs, his patients or his clinic must.\nDr. Thomas Pliura: We've been able to\u2014 to keep the doors open. But it's getting harder and harder. And with these tremendous\u2014 spikes\u2014 it's a problem.\nBill Whitaker: The impact of the rising prices is so great that it might put you out of business?\nDr. Thomas Pliura: No question about it. We've had that discussion right here in this building.\nHe worries his patients will suffer. So, Dr. Pliura has joined unions, pharmacies, school employees and other plaintiffs that have filed dozens of class action lawsuits in the wake of Connecticut's investigation, all accusing generic drug makers of fixing prices.\nBill Whitaker: That's a big fight for a small clinic in rural Illinois to pick.\nDr. Thomas Pliura: I think somebody has to raise their hand. Somebody has to say, \"You know\u2014 it's wrong, what's going on.\" you can't put people in a position where they're forced to either pay their rent or buy food and forego their medication.\" And that's what's \u2014 that's what's happening all over the U.S.\nWilliam Tong: As an attorney general, I look at that and I say, \"How can they do that?\" And I think what we've concluded is they know it's illegal. And\u2014 and it's not that they're too big to fail. It's that they're just too big to care.\nBill Whitaker: That sounds harsh. Too big to care.\nWilliam Tong: That's the only conclusion I think anyone can draw when they see this evidence. And so then you start wondering why would they do this? Because there's just too much money to be made.\nConnecticut Attorney General Tong told us he and the other state attorneys general are continuing to investigate the generic drug industry and plan to file more lawsuits.\nWilliam Tong: This conspiracy has caused billions and billions of dollars in damages to the people of Connecticut and states across the country. And we're gonna take them on in court and hold them accountable. And they're gonna pay for the money they stole from the American people.\nProduced by Marc Lieberman and Ali Rawaf.

    "https://www.gadgets360.com/mobiles/reviews/huawei-nova-3i-first-impressions-price-in-india-nova-3-1890534": "The Huawei Nova 3 and Nova 3i are the Chinese phonemaker's latest offerings in the mid-range smartphone segment in India. These new Nova 3 series phones have been launched within months of the premium Huawei P20 Pro (Review) and affordable P20 Lite (Review), which the company brought to the Indian market in April this year. Huawei's Nova 3 and Nova 3i share a lot of features including AI-powered dual rear and dual front cameras, display notches, up to 128GB of storage, and numerous software capabilities.\nAs for price in India, Huawei Nova 3 will set you back by Rs. 34,999. It has 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. On the other hand, the Nova 3i price in India is Rs. 20,990; the handset has 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. This pricing puts the Nova 3i within striking distance of the Huawei P20 Lite which debuted around 3 months back at a price of Rs. 19,999.\nThe new Nova 3 series phones arrive in a regular black and an offbeat Iris Purple colour variant. With glass backs, both models are extremely reflective but we like the Iris Purple versions more because of the ability to see different shades depending on the way you hold them. This has been Huawei's and sub-brand Honor's trademark design touch in 2018 so far. The design language is pretty similar for both models.\nThe two new models are already up for pre-booking, exclusively on Amazon India, and the Nova 3 will go on sale in the country starting August 23. The Nova 3i release date is before that - August 7.\nThe Nova 3 will take on the likes of the OnePlus 6 (Review), Asus ZenFone 5Z (Review), and Honor 10 (Review). On the other hand, the Nova 3i competes with the Huawei P20 Lite, Nokia 6 (2018) (Review), and Moto X4 (Review).\nThe Huawei Nova 3 sports a 6.3-inch full-HD+ panel with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio, thanks to the display notch. Despite the notch and a claimed 83 percent screen-to-body ratio, the phone doesn't have a borderless design, and there's a significant chin below the screen. The phone is fairly comfortable to hold in one hand but you might need to stretch your thumbs to reach all corners of the screen.\nThe notch houses the IR Face Unlock sensor and a pair of cameras. The Nova 3 supports 3D Qmoji, Huawei's take on AR-based emojis, with its front cameras. With 7-8 emoji characters to choose from, the smartphone reads our facial actions with decent accuracy in the brief time we spent with it. For an extensive performance test, stay tuned for our full review.\nOn the back, you can see the vertically stacked pair of cameras. There's a 16-megapixel primary sensor and a 24-megapixel secondary sensor, both with f/1.8 apertures. Camera performance seemed decent in a well-lit room but we can't yet comment on low-light and outdoor performance. On the right of the device are the volume controls and the lock/ power button. On the left is the tray for two Nano-SIM cards. The phone supports dual 4G VoLTE. On the bottom are a USB Type-C port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a speaker.\nAt its core, the Huawei Nova 3 is powered by Huawei's trusted HiSilicon Kirin 970 SoC, which has an independent NPU for AI capabilities. Notably, this is the same processor that the Chinese phonemaker has been using on its flagship and mid-range smartphones for the past couple of years. Performance with EMUI 8.2 seemed fluid in our brief experience. We will test out the smartphone's performance extensively in our upcoming review.\nNow, let's talk a bit about the Huawei Nova 3i. The more affordable of the two, this model sports the same 6.3-inch panel with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and a notch up top. Most of the design elements are similar to the Nova 3, but there's a Micro-USB port on the bottom instead of USB Type-C. While there are four cameras in all on this phone too, the camera combinations are slightly toned down. The dual rear camera setup gets a 16-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel secondary sensor, and performance is likely to be less impressive than with the Nova 3. The front of the phone has a 24-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel secondary unit.\nHuawei Nova 3i (front)\nOn the inside, the Huawei Nova 3i is powered by the company's latest processor, the HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC. This is the first smartphone to feature this new 12nm chip, and it could potentially offer decent performance in its segment. It's coupled with 4 gigabytes of RAM. The battery on the more premium Huawei Nova 3 has a capacity of 3,750mAh, while the Nova 3i gets a smaller 3,340mAh unit. We will note both their video loop test results and real-world performance in our upcoming reviews.\nHuawei Nova 3, Nova 3i software\nBoth of these smartphones run EMUI 8.2 atop Android 8.1 Oreo, and have similar features. First of all, let's talk about the preloaded apps, of which there are plenty. Both smartphones come with seven games including Asphalt Nitro, Dragon Mania, and Sonic Runners. Some other apps such as Netflix, Z Camera, Camera360, Facebook, Facebook Messenger, and Truecaller are also visible on the devices when you boot them for the first time. A Huawei app gallery adds to the bloatware issue that plagues Huawei's Emotion UI.\nHuawei Nova 3i\nOne of the highlights of the two new phones is the new AI shopping capability that Huawei has developed in partnership with Amazon India. With the help of AI, the software on these two phones can help identify a product you want to purchase and point you to it on Amazon.in, along the lines of Google Lens and Samsung Mall. It works in two ways - you can either take a photo of a product, or long-press on a photo from the gallery to reveal links to similar products. While we did not get enough time with the units at launch to check this feature out for ourselves, the demo shown on the sidelines looked promising. We will be testing out the pros and cons of the software on the Huawei Nova 3 and Nova 3i very soon.\nStay tuned to Gadgets 360 for full reviews of these two devices, in which we will evaluate their design, displays, software, performance, battery life, cameras, and value for money.\nCan Huawei Nova 3 beat OnePlus 6 in India?

The Pittsburgh Steelers have some tough decisions to make before that deadline arrives on Saturday at 4pm EST.\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers roster is mostly set from the returning players in 2017.

There is no need to have four on the team and one of the four will be gone.\nThat one, in this prediction, is Joshua Dobbs. Dobbs has done a great job in the preseason but likely is not enough to keep him a Steeler.\nThe Steelers could look to trade Dobbs or just outright cut him.

He, however, had something to smile in the ensuing moments, hitting Bravo for two successive boundaries off the last two balls to take MI to 149 for eight.

From fights to tasks and emotions, the Telugu audience witnessed an extra dose of drama this week.\nWith his weekend gig, Nani took on his hosting responsibilities not only by announcing eliminations but also rightly picking out contestants who messed up during the week.\nAfter a dual elimination, week two's nominees were Ganesh, Kaushal, Nutan Naidu, Babu Gogenini and Deepthi Sunaina. And one must say, most bets were on either Nutan Naidu or Ganesh to exit the house and as predicted Nutan Naidu was announced as the second contestant to exit the Bigg Boss Telugu 2 house.\nWhile plenty of action unfolded in the house over the past few days, here's what got the audience most hooked:\nDirty Games\nThis week's luxury budget task involved performing in plenty of mud, which ultimately lead to heated up arguments between both the teams. As Geetha spearheaded this task, knowingly or unknowingly the singer gets dragged into most fights. While Kaushal particularly gets criticised for going against Geetha's decision time and again, Babu Gogineni has a moment of rage questioning Bigg Boss about the safety of the housemates. From Tanish's rage to Kaushal's lack of sportiness, it is all directed towards Geetha, evidently leaving her pissed and in an argument with Tanish. At the end of the dirty games between Nandini & Co vs Deepthi & Co, Deepthi and Nutan are once again sent to jail for losing.\nPunishment & war in the name of house rules\nThe weekly luxury budget task came to an end, with Deepthi and Nutan eventually coming out, but with lots of questions being raised about Kaushal. The fact that the actor had the jail card and did not want to use it for anyone, raised lots of eyebrows. But moving on, the main drama in the house starts only after this. Bigg Boss calls out Samrat, the captain of the week and lists out a slew of complaints. The contestants are pointed out for talking in English, sleeping and many other house rules that everyone seems to neglect. Samrat is made to take a dip in in the pool every time a housemate converses in English and the rest of them light up candles all night as punishment.\nTanish vs Kaushal\nWhile Samrat is still struggling to get the housemates to obey rules, this week's twist too takes places or rather begins with the captain himself. Samrat gets serious as he instructs the housemates to clean up their own dishes and keep bathrooms clean among other petty things. But Nutan finds Samrat's requests offensive and against family values, leading to a harsh argument.\nThings obviously heat up and hell breaks loose as Tanish and Kaushal involve themselves in support of Samrat and Nutan. The two are then at loggerheads for an entire episode, trying to make their point and arguing about figure of speech. Tanish accuses Kaushal of throwing a fit for no reason at the wrong time and Kaushal, on the other hand, is pissed with Tanish for being arrogant and supporting Samrat. The two also continue to fight regarding an incident that took place during the 'Chapandi Prabhu' task last week. Kaushal is accused of making Deepthi Sunaina feel uncomfortable, while Kaushal makes zero sense of this argument, as he feels it was done and dusted the moment he made peace with Sunaina. Or at least that's what everyone thinks, because little do they know that Sunaina wasn't actually done with that incident yet.\nAmit elected as captain of Week 3\nKaushal, Tanish and Amit stand up for the captaincy of week 3 and after a grueling task, Amit is announced as the winner. But yet again, the drama continues with Kaushal at loggerheads with Keeriti this time around. Keeriti is seen playing duplictious games and instigating Kaushal for no apparent reason. Keeriti kicks off Kaushal's rage once again by trying to turn the women of the house against him. And while Amit is made the new captain, arguments about Keeriti's mind games continue to take place.\nNani points fingers at Tanish and Deepthi Sunaina\nAfter an intense week of arguments, threats and what not, it was time for Nani to take over. With his weekend stint, while he made the housemates laugh with plenty of fun tasks and entertained the audience with witty remarks, he also makes a point or two. Nani goes on to talk about the impact the Bigg Boss contestants have on Telugu audience and how even a slight change in behavior can affect their votes. He emphasises on Kaushal's concern at being cornered and how his honest fight turned around the game for him.\nWhile that was the case for Kaushal, Tanish and Deepthi Sunaina definitely seem to be in Nani's bad books for the time being. As Sunaina was pulled up for not standing for herself, bitching and constantly being treated as a kid, Tanish's anger management was addressed too. The two seemed to be in deep trouble for their attitude and are chastised by Nani.\nApart from one-on-one tiffs, Nani also throws light on group-ism keeping in mind Tejaswi, Samrat and Tanish in particular and how this is alienating other contestants. The star host goes on to warn housemates about favourable behavior and audience reaction to the same.\nA lot of new controversies with existing bonds are now brewing in the house, post the eviction of Sanjana and now Nutan, both of whom were season two's first jail inmates and the most controversial ones too.

    "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/big-brother-20-kaycee-clark-finale-interview-1147464/": "The Big Brother season 20 finale was a night of firsts.\nViewers witnessed a proposal on finale night when Swaggy C Williams got down on one knee for Bayleigh Dayton.\nThere was a former White House staffer in attendance. Superfan of the show, and former contestant herself (after appearing on Celebrity Big Brother), Omarosa Manigault Newman sat proudly in the audience and even stuck around for a few photo ops with the cast.\nThen Kaycee Clark and JC Mounduix made it the first time ever that two gay contestants made it to the final three on Big Brother.\nKaycee was ultimately named the winner, making her the first lesbian to win the game.\n\u201cBeing full lesbian, with tattoos and into sports I was just different than what they\u2019ve seen in past seasons,\u201d she tells The Hollywood Reporter the morning after her walking away with the winning title and $500,000.\nThe fan-favorite season featured non-stop gameplay from a standout cast of characters. Below Kaycee looks back at the season, reveals when she knew she could beat Tyler Crispen and what\u2019s next for the former pro football player.\nLet\u2019s go! Huge congrats on your win.\nLet\u2019s go! I get so hyped when I say it.\nDo you remember when I first interviewed you and I kept asking how you were so calm. How did you remain so calm in the game? What were some moments that really got to you?\nJust as a person I am really calm and laid back and it takes a lot for me to blow up. That\u2019s what helped me throughout the house. But I wanted to blow up when I knew people were lying to my face like Scottie and Haleigh just being extra and fake around me. There was so much I wanted to say, but I knew that I had to bite my tongue. Less is more and you don\u2019t want to blow up.\nYou blew when Rockstar called you out as being the hacker. What got to you there?\nI was already irritated with Rockstar. It made it easier. She always irritated me! And after blowing up no one questioned me. That\u2019s what I wanted.\nOn the live feeds you said that you were told in casting that there\u2019s never been a player like you. What do you think they meant?\nBeing full lesbian, with tattoos and into sports I was just different than what they\u2019ve seen in past seasons.\nYou made history on finale night.\nIt\u2019s so huge to be the first lesbian to win the game. It still hasn\u2019t hit me.\nWhen in the game did you realize that you could win it all?\nI knew being in level six and how strong we were that we\u2019d get far. I didn\u2019t start playing in vetoes until the middle of the season, but when I got to play I said, \u201cWe\u2019re in control week after week.\u201d And being able to ride the rest of the way was because of my social game.\nWas there anyone from night one that you thought you were going to align with that you\u2019re glad you didn\u2019t?\nI was thinking [I\u2019d align with] Swaggy. For some weird reason he was just a guy I would hang out with outside of the house. He had good vibes. Definitely thankful I did not team up with him! It worked out exactly how it was supposed to.\nDo you think you\u2019ll be invited to Swaggy and Bayleigh\u2019s wedding?\n(Laughs!) I have no idea! Maybe Bayleigh will invite me. I would definitely go.\nWhich alumni that you met was your favorite?\nJess, Cody, Dani! And I liked Josh a lot more than I expected. I loved his energy.\nYou were loyal throughout the game. Was it intentional not to make any enemies?\nI wanted to stay as loyal and true to myself as much as possible. And I wanted to stay low from the very beginning. It\u2019s crazy how everything worked out as how I wanted to play the game.\nWas there anyone on the jury whose vote surprised you?\nI was worried about Sam\u2019s vote! I know Tyler thought he had Scottie\u2019s vote, but me and Scottie were really close. After Tyler was telling him that he was good it just rubbed Scottie the wrong way.\nDid you realize that you could beat Tyler in the end?\nYes, that\u2019s exactly what I knew (laughs). He was getting a lot of blood on his hands. I didn\u2019t. I was trying to be as physical as possible and he had the master plans. But I wanted to keep it simple. The house was already going crazy and I wasn\u2019t going to stop him from getting blood on his hands! And he did an amazing job, but I knew people weren\u2019t liking him.\nIf he won the final head of household and brought JC to the final two, whom would you have voted for to win?\nI probably would have still voted for him.\nWhat did you learn about yourself this season?\nI recently was able to start opening up. I keep a lot of my feelings to myself and it\u2019s hard to really hide it in that house. I learned that it\u2019s OK to have feelings and be super vulnerable and not overthink that.\nIf Tyler and Angela compete on The Amazing Race, whom from this season will you take as your partner?\n(Laughs!) Rachel. It would be funny. Rachel is a competitor and would be down to do whatever. I was thinking JC too, but he\u2019s such a princess and he\u2019s not going to do it. That would be a nightmare.\nWhat are you doing with the grand prize money?\nI need some new gel (laughs). I want to help out my family and whatever I can do to make life easier for them. And I want to travel with my family and friends and just enjoy life.\nWhat did you think about the finale? Was Kaycee your pick to win? Sound off in the comments section below and stay tuned to the Live Feed for all things Big Brother. Season two of Celebrity Big Brother will air in January 2019.",
    "https://www.macleans.ca/politics/newfoundland-liberals-hang-onto-power-in-razor-close-election/": "A province in dire need of stable government instead gets a minority, and a likely return to the polls in the near future\nSo nobody won in Newfoundland and Labrador\u2014not really.\nIt was a snap election the people of Newfoundland didn\u2019t particularly want. The two leading parties, the governing Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives, were so alike that one voter said she could close her eyes and put a check mark next to either one. Another joked she could choose via \u201ceeny, meeny, miny, moe.\u201d\nAnd after a campaign criticized for its paucity of policy ideas to address the province\u2019s dire financial position, the people of Newfoundland will now have a minority government in the House of Assembly\u2014with no clear path to the stable leadership the province badly needs.\nThe Liberals narrowly held off the blue wave that has taken over many provincial legislatures in Canada, but with most of the votes counted, Premier Dwight Ball\u2019s party stood to win only 20 of 40 seats in the provincial House of Assembly, while the Progressive Conservatives were leading in 15 ridings. The NDP was leading in three while Independent candidates had been declared in two.\n\u201cThe message they\u2019re sending to us is we must come together,\u201d Ball told an audience in Deer Lake after TV stations had called the result.\nThat message certainly wasn\u2019t received by PC leader Ches Crosbie. \u201cWe have a situation of constitutional instability,\u201d he said in his post-election speech. \u201cWhere will this end up? It will not end up with Dwight Ball as Premier of Newfoundland one year from now.\n\u201cI am not conceding victory the Liberals,\u201d he added. \u201cThey will have to struggle for the next few months and years to hang onto power.\u201d And what the Liberals won\u2019t have next time, he stressed, is the ability to \u201cuse every possible advantage of power to cut short the democratic process \u2026 to pull the rug out under from under the NDP\u2019s feet and the PC party\u2019s feet.\u201d\nCrosbie\u2019s reference was well understood by partisans and regular voters alike. Ball had gotten a head start on the campaign last month with a snap election called within 24 hours of releasing the budget, leaving the opposition scrambling to start the campaign.\nThe Liberals, as a result, were the only party fully prepared out of the gates with a platform, a full slate of candidates, all 27 incumbents seeking re-election, little fear of vote-splitting with the NDP and money in their war chest.\n\u201cThe fact that it was called this early did catch us off guard a little bit,\u201d acknowledged PC campaign manager Robert Lundrigan before the votes came in. \u201cWe had a few candidates who could not sign on until the last second.\u201d\nThe PCs could only register 39 candidates in the province\u2019s 40 ridings before deadline, and booted another candidate out only a week before the election when anti-abortion and anti-gay marriage views were uncovered on his social media history.\nThe NDP was even less prepared. Once considered on the verge of Official Opposition, the party struggled mightily to find viable candidates, as infighting and organizational problems limited it to 14 before the deadline.\nIt was shaping up to be a missed opportunity of glaring proportion. \u201cNewfoundlanders blame the economic climate on the PC party that was in government for a long time, while also not feeling confidence in the Liberals because of harassment in the House, new taxes and the [deficit reduction] levy,\u201d said Amanda Bittner, a political science professor at the Memorial University of Newfoundland. \u201cThe people want change. If the NDP had been better organized, there might have been more a feeling to a switch to something new.\u201d\nYet when the smoke had cleared, the early election call appeared to have backfired. The Tories came close to pulling the same share of the popular vote the Liberals did, while the NDP performed surprisingly well, winning three seats. Along with the two won by Independents, they held the potential to give the New Democrats and leader Alison Coffin the balance of power.\n\u201cThe Liberals played the game\u2014hard,\u201d said Russell Williams, head of the Department of Political Science at the Memorial University of Newfoundland; but Ball\u2019s early election call may have left many voters cynical because it appeared to be a self-serving move.\n\u201cThey created a budget with no intention to debate it in the House, and called the election when the other parties weren\u2019t organized,\u201d agreed Bittner. \u201cIt was not taking voters or democracy seriously when we have a lot of challenges. People know politics is a game, but when that becomes too crass, then folks aren\u2019t happy.\u201d\nWhatever the reason for the Liberals\u2019 backslide\u2014their seat count is down seven from when the election was called\u2014it will almost certainly trigger a round of negotiations to choose a Speaker, much like after the 2017 B.C. election. All eyes will be on the two Independents, one of whom left the Liberals amid allegations of harassment and bullying in the House.\n\u201cIt is important that we work together for all the people of Newfoundland and Labrador,\u201d Ball said in a post-election speech in Corner Brook. \u201cI will continue to welcome collaboration within the House of Assembly. People expect that from their elected officials.\u201d\nPerhaps, but after failing to deliver on promises from their last campaign to reverse an HST increase and make sure no public-sector workers were laid off, the Liberals weren\u2019t seen as entirely trustworthy. Meanwhile, fresh promises\u2014like a cutting the tax on auto insurance and doing away with the unpopular \u201cdebt reduction levy\u201d on residents earning more than $50,000 annually\u2014often fell on deaf ears. They came, after all, from the same party that introduced the taxes a few years ago, presenting them as difficult but necessary decisions.\nAnd delivering on such pledges will be no easier now that it was three and a-half years ago. The province has the oldest population in Canada, a falling GDP for 2018, and the highest debt per capita in its history. The Liberals presented few policy platforms that would address the budget deficit in a substantial way, be it to increase revenue or reign spending.\nThey were reduced instead to playing effective defence, emphasizing to voters that the dire finances they inherited from the PCs could not be fixed in only four years and hammering on how the Muskrat Falls \u201cboondoggle\u201d took place under the PCs tenure as the province\u2019s finances turned south. Crosbie tried to distance himself from Muskrat Falls, saying it was now a different PC party under new leadership\u2014even if the PC\u2019s were in power from 2003-2015.\nUnfortunately for the PC leader, many voters keen for change saw little to choose between his program and Ball\u2019s. In the riding of St. John\u2019s West, local resident doctor Chris Fraser said he and friends found not only that both parties emphasized the same issues, but that they proposed the same ideas to address them. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the hat they\u2019re wearing barely matters,\u201d he says.\nWhile Fraser was impressed by Crosbie, he was less wowed by his local PC candidate. Stuck between casting a ballot for the benefit of the PC leader or for his preferred local Liberal representative, he was undecided until the morning of election day. He picked the red hat.\nSoon, he and the rest of the people of Newfoundland and Labrador may have to do it all over.\n\u201cThe loser in this election is undoubtedly the public,\u201d lamented Williams. \u201cThe public is going to get a response to this [fiscal] situation that they didn\u2019t understand when they went to the ballot box. That\u2019s bad for the public, bad for the economy of the province and bad for democracy.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with election results and quotes",

All we could do was retire the car.\u201d\nHorner said Ricciardo's misfortune soured what was Red Bull's best race in a while, as Verstappen romped to victory.\n\u201cThe thing that feels bittersweet is we should've have had them both up there,\u201d he said.\nDaniel Ricciardo, Red Bull Racing RB14 Photo by: Steven Tee / LAT Images",

    "https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Vote-no-on-Prop-8-It-will-limit-dialysis-13306673.php": "Proposition 8 is a contradiction: Its promise to improve patient care at dialysis facilities and contain costs will not be realized \u2014 instead, the measure will negatively impact public health in California. The proposal to redirect health care resources is misguided and will lead to higher health care costs and barriers to care.\nHere\u2019s how:\nSome 83 percent of California dialysis clinics will operate at a loss if Prop. 8 is implemented, according to the forecast of the independent Berkeley Research Group. Fewer dialysis clinics in operation will lead to patient crowding in the remaining clinics and limit dialysis appointments.\nProp. 8 will limit access to care for all dialysis patients because it specifically limits reimbursement from private insurance. The higher reimbursement rates from private insurance are what currently offsets the lower reimbursements to the clinics for Medi-Cal and Medicare. Thus, financial risk is distributed among high-earning and low-earning clinics \u2014 some of which are not profitable \u2014 and between urban and rural clinics. DaVita and Fresenius, the two major dialysis corporations, provide the majority of dialysis services in California and have a broad geographic presence.\nProp. 8 will drive up administrative costs. To regulate revenues, dialysis clinics will be required to develop additional accounting practices to track charges to insurance companies. The California Department of Public Health will be required to review these filings, at an estimated cost in the millions of dollars. Unfortunately, none of these expenses contributes directly to improving clinical care.\nThe measure\u2019s narrow definition for allowable costs neglects the value of the indirect costs integral to clinic operations. One example, even though physician dialysis medical directors are mandated, their services would not be an allowable cost. Other exclusions include support staff, facility administrators, nurse coordinators and health educators. Each plays an important role and without a complete team, clinic performance will suffer.\nThe implications of cutbacks to health education programs are particularly severe and the costs steep. Dialysis patients benefit from a strong understanding of their disease as a single missed dialysis session results in a 30 percent increased risk of death. Patients who miss sessions will have to rely on urgent dialysis through emergency room visits and hospital admissions that are much more costly \u2014 a bill that will be spread to all Californians.\nThe timing of this measure could not be worse. In 2016, more than 139,000 patients sought care at dialysis centers \u2014 an increase of 46 percent from eight years before.

    "https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/alleged-serial-killer-tied-to-michigan-may-have-killed-9-served-lovers-remains-at-bbq": "article\nA new documentary is shedding light on the victims of an alleged serial killer who authorities say injected her husband with a lethal dose of heroin and also killed her former lover before serving remains at a neighborhood bbq.\nKelly Cochran pleaded guilty earlier this year to killing her husband with the lethal dose but was already serving time in prison for the murder of Chris Regan in Iron River, in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.\nShe pleaded guilty in April to the death of her husband, Jason Cochran, at their home in Indiana. Court documents say Kelly Cochran told investigators she killed her husband because he took \"the only good thing\" in her life in Regan's death.\nIn a new docuseries on Investigation Discovery titled \"Dead North,\" Cochran is being described 'like the devil' in court. The docuseries chronicles the investigation through shocking interviews, extensive bodycam footage and interrogation room conversations.\nRegan disappeared in 2014. Iron River Police Chief Laura Frizzo, who investigated Regan's disappearance, said she met Cochran and her husband during the probe, court documents stated. The investigator learned Cochran was having an affair with Regan but the case went cold until Jason Cochran died in February 2016 of a suspected overdose.\nCochran admitted to prosecutors that she and her husband lured Regan inside their home, shot him and dismembered him, before dumping his remains in the woods. Cochran said she and her husband made a \"pact\" on their wedding night to \"kill off anyone involved in their extramarital affairs.\"\nInvestigation Discovery said in a statement that Cochran's own brother, Colton Caboyan, told investigators he feared his sister was a serial killer and neighbors said they believed they were served human remains, possibly Regan's, at a barbecue. One friend who participated in the documentary also described eating a strange-tasting burger without realizing at the time it could have been human.\nIn February 2016, when Jason died of an apparent heroin overdose, the Regan case was reopened. Michigan authorities charged Cochran with Regan's death but she fled the state.\nThe U.S. Marshals Service eventually tracked her down in Kentucky, where she was arrested and taken into custody. Court documents revealed Cochran spent her time in jail turning her glasses into shanks and threatening to commit suicide, as well as bodily harm to anyone who came near her.\nAfter Regan was killed, Kelly said she was angry at her husband. She said she gave him a lethal overdose of heroin and then choked him until he died. She said she killed him out of revenge for killing Regan.\nDuring Cochran's sentencing for Regan's death, Regan's ex-girlfriend Terri O'Donnell testified that she knew he had gone missing but wasn't prepared for the discovery of his brutal death. She said she was terrified of Cochran.\n\u201cThe first time I saw her was in the courthouse,\u201d said O\u2019Donnell. \u201cI just remember her staring at me and grinning. I took a deep breath and thought she was the scariest person I've ever seen. I was afraid. I couldn\u2019t look at her for the rest of the time I was there testifying. It was like she was\u2026 laughing and saying, \u2018Look at what I did. You can\u2019t stop me.\u2019\u2026 She just sat there and grinned.\n\u201cIt was like the devil looking at you\u2026 And after I testified\u2026 I lost it. I totally lost it. I just remember driving, speeding, not knowing if I had crossed the border. I didn\u2019t know if I was in Wisconsin or Michigan\u2026 I didn\u2019t know what to do. I just wanted to run as far away from Kelly as possible.\u201d\nCochran directed Michigan authorities to a site where parts of the rifle used to shoot Regan were found, as well as a .22-caliber bullet. Human remains were also discovered, including a skull with an apparent bullet hole. A pair of eyeglasses, believed to belong to Regan, were nearby.\nO\u2019Donnell insisted Regan\u2019s murder was not the first for the Cochrans.\n\u201cI do not think that Chris is the first person that they murdered,\u201d she explained. \u201cThere\u2019s just no way that the first person you choose to kill, you\u2019re going to be able to clean up the blood and get rid of the body so that FBI agents can\u2019t pull DNA off the walls\u2026 To do what they did to him? I don\u2019t know how you could do that if it was the first person you\u2019ve ever murdered.\n\u201cShooting someone, that\u2019s one thing\u2026 You can be far away, pull out your gun and it\u2019s done. But to sit there, take a cut up a body and to then wrap his parts, put it in your vehicle and haul it over to the woods and bury it? There\u2019s no possible way you could logically think through all of that\u2026 I truly believe there are other people out there.\u201d\nCochran's family told investigators she may have killed as many as nine people and buried their bodies throughout the Midwest.\nCochran cannot be prosecuted in Indiana for any additional murders. That was part of her plea deal in Jason's death: if she provides locations of other victims, she can do so and not face additional charges in the Hoosier state.\nShe claimed to having other \u201cfriends\u201d buried in Indiana, Michigan, Tennessee and Minnesota. However, the identities and specific locations of these bodies remain a mystery to this day.\nCochran was sentenced to life in prison without parole in May 2017 for Regan's murder. She will serve an additional 65 years in prison for the murder of Jason in Indiana.\n\"Dead North\" is available for streaming on IDGO.com.\nInformation from the Associated Press and FOX News was used in this report.",

He wants his company to build the infrastructure that will one day allow future generations to colonize space.\nAt a speech in Washington, Jeff Bezos revealed Blue Moon --- a huge lunar lander that can transport 3.6 tons of cargo to the Moon's surface. The craft has been in development for three years and will be used to shuttle scientific equipment and other payloads, maybe even humans.\nThe Blue Moon will be powered by Blue Origin's new BE-7 engine, which is capable of 10,000 pounds of thrust. Engineers will be test firing the BE-7 for the first time in West Texas sometime this summer.\nBezos indicated that he is behind sending people up as well. Regarding US Vice President Mike Pence's goal of having humans on the Moon by 2024, the Amazon head said he was all for it.\n\"I love this,\" he told the DC crowd. \"It's the right thing to do. We can help meet that timeline but only because we started three years ago. It's time to go back to the Moon --- this time to stay.\"\nHe said that if they equipped the Blue Moon with \"stretch tanks\" it would be able to transport an additional 2.9 tons of cargo. The extra space would be enough for a \"crewed ascent vehicle.\"\nThe Washington Post notes that Bezos did not indicate whether he would be seeking contracts from NASA for payload deliveries, but considering that he is reportedly burning through about a billion dollars per year on Blue Origin, contract requests seem likely.\nHowever, Bezos stopped short of saying we should colonize the Moon. His vision is to build colonies called O'Neill cylinders, named for their creator Gerard O'Neill.\nThese free-floating colonies are made up of two counter-rotating cylinders as to cancel out gyroscopic effects that would knock them out of alignment to the sun. Each tube would be five miles in diameter and twenty miles long. The rotation would provide artificial gravity and energy would be supplied via solar panels on the tubes' exterior.\nBezos imagines a million people living in each cylinder in climate-controlled utopias.\n\"This is Maui on its best day all year long,\" he said. \"No rain. No earthquakes. People are going to want to live here.\"\nOf course, this is not likely something that Bezos can finish in his lifetime. He said his job is to \"build the road\" that could lead to such colonization. The only two obstacles he sees are the costs associated with entering space and discovering ways to utilize off-planet resources.\nBoth problems are priority items that Blue Origin has been working toward with the New Shepard launch system and the Blue Moon lander. He believes that if we can build the infrastructure, future generations can accomplish almost anything in space.",

Weapons like this are also cheaper and safer to operate, allowing forces to maximize their resources.\nBoeing on Wednesday revealed its latest aerial platform, the Boeing Airpower Teaming System. The jet-like aircraft was designed to fly solo, unmanned missions or alongside existing military aircraft in a support role at a fraction of the cost associated with traditional fighter jets.\nThe Boeing Airpower Teaming System measures 38 feet long with a range of more than 2,000 nautical miles. Boeing said the craft can be loaded with onboard sensors to support intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions and electronic warfare.\nKristin Robertson, vice president and general manager of Boeing Autonomous Systems, said the company's latest will \"truly be a force multiplier as it protects and projects air power.\"\nDeveloped by Boeing Australia, the project is the company's largest investment in a new unmanned aircraft program outside the US.\nUnmanned aircraft afford a number of advantages over human-piloted fighter jets.

    "https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/cobra-kai/cobra-kai-season-2-william-zabka-ralph-macchio-you/": "When Cobra Kai\u2014the You Tube Premium series that continues The Karate Kid story\u2014premiered last May, one might\u2019ve anticipated a cheesy, nostalgic gimmick.\nBut to critics\u2019 and fans\u2019 great delight, the 10-episode first season was a nuanced, wonderful surprise. The half-hour series did what many in the current revival craze could not: It created a story that honored its past while forging a totally new direction.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nostalgic, but it\u2019s also fresh and relevant,\u201d says Ralph Macchio, who returned to play Daniel LaRusso 34 years after that famous crane kick. \u201cIt tastes like comfort food but feels like you\u2019re eating it for the first time. It\u2019s not a comedy, it\u2019s not a drama, it\u2019s not an action show, but yes, it is. It\u2019s all of it.\u201d\nWhen both Macchio and William Zabka, who plays Daniel\u2019s rival, Johnny Lawrence, were first approached about reprising their iconic roles, they were cautious. Both credit executive producers Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg for having the right vision and tone for the series.\n\u201cTheir passion and vision for it was so clear and so contagious,\u201d Zabka says. \u201cThese guys love it and they are huge fans of The Karate Kid and they know the characters inside and out sometimes better than we do. It was the right time, the right people, the right platform.\nThe Johnny inside of me kind of stirred. I always say Johnny\u2019s crusty eyes opened up and they tapped into something. I loved the idea of coming in from Johnny\u2019s point of view and giving him some depth. One thing I just said going into it is, \u2018I don\u2019t want to repeat the past. Are we setting Johnny up for a 2020 crane kick to the face?\u2019\u201d\nThey most decidedly were not. The series made Daniel the successful owner of a car dealership with a loving wife and two children. Time has not been so kind to Johnny, who is living in an apartment building, estranged from his only son, Robby (Tanner Buchanan), and working odd jobs. Johnny is stuck in the past, his whole life set off on a downward trajectory after his high school karate glory days.\n\u201cSociety [has] changed so much [in the] last 10 years, there\u2019s something really fresh about playing a guy who is outside that box,\u201d Zabka says. \u201cAnd bringing people up to speed about where we are today through his eyes.\u201d\nIn the first season, Johnny opens up the Cobra Kai dojo and, mirroring the events of the 1984 movie, helps the picked-on Miguel (Xolo Mariduena) learn karate and prepare for the big All Valley Championship, with the finals against Robby, who Daniel has trained.\nIn the second season, Daniel continues his journey back to karate by opening up the Miyagi-Do, teaching a new crop of kids the way Mr. Miyagi (the late Pat Morita) taught him all those years ago.\n\u201cIt was so important to me to have the Miyagi character woven throughout the series in some shape or form,\u201d Macchio says. \u201cHe\u2019s a big part of who LaRusso is. Now it\u2019s part of him finding his balance and filling the void of Miyagi and passing on that legacy.\u201d\nMacchio affectionately refers to the high school storyline on the series as the \u201ckarate soap opera of it all.\u201d \u201cSecond season has all that comfort food and that nostalgic feel that you love and you\u2019re craving, yet it takes you in a direction you would never expect. The young story gets even deeper and more entwined and involved and more invested.\u201d\nThe high school storylines also have Macchio and Zabka working with actors who are close to the age they were when they first started the franchise. \u201cThese kids are professionals,\u201d Zabka says. \u201cI say \u2018kids,\u2019 but they are young adults. All of them started when they were younger, so they have a lot of experience in the business. There\u2019s really nobody that\u2019s green like I was. When I did Karate Kid, it was my first movie ever. I remember asking Pat Morita [to] keep an eye out for me and anything I can do better, let me know. And a number of times he would whisper in my ear and give me some advice that I really took to the bank.\u201d\nThe biggest thing Zabka and Macchio do is lead by example, Zabka says: \u201cRalph and I have been around the block enough. We just try to set a tone of a great working environment of a lot of fun and mutual respect for everybody.\u201d\nThe first season ended on a cliffhanger, with the return of Martin Kove as Johnny\u2019s sensei, John Kreese. Kove plays a pivotal role in the series\u2019 second season.\n\u201cMarty and I are dear friends,\u201d Zabka says. \u201cWe just felt like these guys aren\u2019t done yet. There\u2019s something unresolved between Johnny and Kreese, and for a number of years we just kind of bounced ideas around and thought, \u2018What would that look like?\u2019 But we never cracked the code. When it finally happened, it was just thrilling. It\u2019s a great long burn all through Season Two of their relationship and the levels of complexity between them. Sensei/student, yet now they are both sensei, seeing eye-to-eye\u2026 There\u2019s a lot of love, a lot of pain, a lot of dysfunction and all of those levels were just incredible to play with Marty.\u201d\nThis season also reunites Johnny with his fellow Cobra Kais, as Rob Garrison, Tony O\u2019Dell and Ron Thomas return to play Johnny\u2019s old high school pals Tommy, Jimmy and Bobby. \u201cAfter The Karate Kid, it was like a fraternity. We just instantly clicked and we\u2019ve been great friends all these years. I felt a little sad and a little lonely that the guys weren\u2019t around for the ride last season.\u201d\nBoth Macchio and Zabka said it was relatively easy slipping back into their characters. The chemistry was still there after all these years. What\u2019s been a bit more challenging is doing the karate.

Kumaraswamy on Tuesday shifted the responsibility of releasing Tamil actor Rajinikanth\u2019s latest movie, Kaala, on its makers and distributors, asking them not to release the movie in Karnataka, considering the sensitive situation.\nHis statements came even after the Karnataka high court asked the state government to provide security to theatres screening the film. The court heard the case after pro-Kannada groups demanded that the movie not be released in the state over remarks by Rajinikanth about the contentious Cauvery river water sharing issue between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.\nStating that it was the government\u2019s duty to follow the court orders to provide security to centres screening the film, Kumaraswamy said, \u201cin my personal opinion as a Kannadiga, in such situation where there is opposition, it is ideal if they will not release the movie.\"\nKumaraswamy, who hails from the movie industry himself, said that there were many instances of Kannada movies being discriminated in the neighbouring state.\n\u201cAs a government we will take all necessary measures, but if some organisations protest and because of this people don\u2019t turn up, under such circumstances and when they don\u2019t allow our movies to be released, I feel they should not release the movie,\" Kumaraswamy said.\nThe hardened stance of the chief minister comes a day after he met with veteran Tamil actor, Kamal Haasan, who offered to help bridge any differences between the two southern states, including in the Cauvery river water issue.\nThe Cauvery river water issue, that has for generations defined relations between the two states, has taken another turn with the formation of the contentious Cauvery Management Authority (CMA), a body set up to implement the tribunal\u2019s 2007 order on water sharing. This move has been vehemently opposed by Karnataka, one of the two main stakeholders in the dispute.\nKumaraswamy said that the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC) has asked the government not to give permission for the release of the Tamil film.\n\u201cIf they forcefully release the movie they will have to face the consequences. I am not saying this as a chief minister. However, personally, speaking as a Kannadiga, I will say that considering the situation in the state, the makers should themselves not release the movie,\" he said.",

Policy needs to walk, not run, to stand still,\" he said.\nHowever, the Institute of Directors said the Bank had \"jumped the gun\" by raising the rate now.\nIt said: \"The rise threatens to dampen consumer and business confidence at an already fragile time.\n\"Growth has remained subdued, and the recent partial rebound is the least that could be expected after the lack of progress in the year's first quarter.\"\nFive interest rate facts\nMore than 3.5 million residential mortgages are on a variable or tracker rate\nThe average standard variable rate mortgage is 4.72%\nOn a \u00a3150,000 variable mortgage, a rise to 0.75% is likely to increase the annual cost by \u00a3224\nA Bank rate rise does not guarantee the equivalent increase in interest paid to savers.

Either way, only Graham Hill has ever achieved the feat.\nAlonso added victory in the Le Mans 24 Hours this year with Toyota, for whom he is leading the World Endurance Championship this season in addition to his F1 commitments with McLaren, and led 27 of the 200 laps on a one-off attempt at the Indy 500 last year before retiring in the closing stages with engine failure.\nAlonso did not confirm he would race in IndyCar next year, but said: \"The triple crown is something I have been saying for a couple of years now.\n\"To be the best driver in the world there are two possibilities: winning eight world championships - quite unlikely now for me - and the second is to taste different series and different cars.\n\"In sports cars I am doing OK.

If a player is the final one left in a tier, while there might be three players left in a tier at another position, that may help highlight which player one should choose.

For example, David Johnson could return to being a top scorer, but the Cardinals still are not a good team, even with Kyler Murray. The same goes for the Bengals and Joe Mixon. And Todd Gurley has been dealing with knee issues, which pushed him out of the top tier. Still, any of these players could end up as a top-three running back in scoring and it would be a surprise.",

This could be fun here.\n\"Of all the Turn 1s that are challenging, Indy is one of the most challenging Turn 1s that we have because it is so narrow and because guys go three- or four-wide.\"\nSmith is no stranger to the substituting role. The \"super sub\" has filled in for Dale Earnhardt Jr., Tony Stewart, Kurt Busch, Kyle Larson and Aric Almirola since 2012.\n\"Call me whatever you want to call me as long as I get to drive occasionally,\" Smith said.\nSmith will start 27th in the Brickyard 400. Here is how they will line up for the Brickyard 400:\n1. Kyle Busch (Joe Gibbs Racing No. 18 Toyota): He won back-to-back Brickyards in 2015 and 2016 -- and possibly could have made it three consecutive if not for tangling with Martin Truex Jr. last year. He is 39 points up on Kevin Harvick for the regular-season title, and a 15th-place finish or better clinches that for him.\n2. Kevin Harvick (Stewart-Haas Racing No. 4 Ford): The 2003 Brickyard winner has back-to-back sixth-place finishes. He'll be a threat.\n3. Martin Truex Jr. (Furniture Row Racing No. 78 Toyota): Truex has just one career top-5 at Indianapolis. But if NASCAR wants a great storyline, either Truex or Daniel Suarez wins Sunday (or Monday if it rains).\n4. Kurt Busch (Stewart-Haas Racing No. 41 Ford): Busch's lone top-5 finish at the Brickyard came in his first race -- in 2001. This is not one of his best tracks -- his average finish is 15.6.\n5. Joey Logano (Team Penske No. 22 Ford): Logano has led 55 laps in the past five Brickyards and has three top-5s to show for it. Expect him to be in the mix.\n6. Brad Keselowski (Team Penske No. 2 Ford): Keselowski is riding the momentum of a Darlington finish. He has led plenty of laps at Indy (99 in eight starts) but has just one top-5.\n7. Kyle Larson (Chip Ganassi Racing No. 42 Chevrolet): He struggled at Indy last year (he started 25th and finished 28th) but he's traditionally strong at the track. Many wish he would run the Indy 500 someday.\n8. Clint Bowyer (Stewart-Haas Racing No. 14 Ford): Bowyer definitely wishes it was Richmond for him to get momentum into the playoffs. He has just one top-15 finish at Indy in his past five starts.\n9. Ryan Blaney (Team Penske No. 12 Ford): Blaney has failed to finish his past two Brickyard starts. He did already have good news this week -- Body Armour has increased its sponsorship to be a primary for at least three races next year and will be on the car Sunday.\n10. Denny Hamlin (Joe Gibbs Racing No. 11 Toyota): Hamlin had three consecutive top-5 Brickyard finishes before finishing 17th last year. Maybe it's a good thing Hamlin isn't starting up front. He has started from the pole in three of his past four races and has posted finishes of 13th, eighth and 10th in those events.\n11. Chase Elliott (Hendrick Motorsports No. 9 Chevrolet): He has one top-15 finish in three starts at Indianapolis. This one could be a struggle.\n12. Aric Almirola (Stewart-Haas Racing No. 10 Ford): Almirola has never led a lap and has no finish better than 13th at the Brickyard. But he's in the playoffs, and that's what counts.\n13. Erik Jones (Joe Gibbs Racing No. 20 Toyota): He led 10 laps but didn't finish the race a year ago. He struggled here in Xfinity with no top-20 finish in any of his three starts.\n14. Jimmie Johnson (Hendrick Motorsports No. 48 Chevrolet): A four-time Brickyard winner, Johnson isn't guaranteed a spot in the playoffs. If someone outside the current top-16 win and Alex Bowman earns 20 (and possibly 19) more points than Johnson, the seven-time Cup champion would miss the playoffs. Don't expect that to happen. But no one expected Johnson to be on the bubble.\n15. Alex Bowman (Hendrick Motorsports No. 88 Chevrolet): Bowman, who hasn't raced at Indy since 2015, could race his way into the playoffs with a win or earning 20 (and possibly 19) more points than 16.\n16. Ricky Stenhouse Jr. (Roush Fenway Racing No. 17 Ford): Stenhouse doesn't have a top-10 in his five Brickyard starts. He probably wishes he can race the temporary IMS dirt track again, as he did Thursday night.\n17. Ryan Newman (Richard Childress Racing No. 31 Chevrolet): : Newman is one of four drivers outside the top-16 who have won the Brickyard and need a win to make it into the playoffs. He has shown speed in recent weeks (qualifying top-10 in five of the past eight races). But he'll need a perfect race to make the playoffs.\n18. Austin Dillon (Richard Childress Racing No. 3 Chevrolet): Dillon has two top-10s in five career Brickyard starts. He has no stress, though, just as he hasn't had stress for the entire season since winning the Daytona 500.\n19. Paul Menard (Wood Brothers Racing No. 21 Ford): Menard's only Cup win came in the 2011 Brickyard 400. He's had 257 starts since then, the longest winless streak of any full-time driver.\n20. Daniel Suarez (Joe Gibbs Racing No. 19 Toyota): Suarez probably has had a tough time as it is likely that Truex replaces him next year at JGR. He could end up at Leavine Family Racing, but no one would blame him for testing the waters. He was 20th in the points last year and 20th this year. Indy is a good track for him -- he was seventh in this race last year and posted a third and seventh in his two Xfinity starts.\n21. Jamie McMurray (Chip Ganassi Racing No. 1 Chevrolet): McMurray won the 2010 Indy 500 and is coming off a ninth-place finish at Darlington. Can he capture the magic, win and make the playoffs? He probably has the best shot of anyone.\n22. William Byron (Hendrick Motorsports No. 24 Chevrolet): Byron is 1-for-1 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway as he won the Xfinity race at the track last year.\n23. Chris Buescher (JTG Daugherty Racing No. 37 Chevrolet): Buescher has a 14th and a ninth in his two Brickyard starts so don't be surprised to see him flirting with a top-10.\n24. AJ Allmendinger (JTG Daugherty Racing No. 47 Chevrolet): He has two top-10 finishes at Indy -- not counting his seventh-place finish in the 2013 Indianapolis 500.\n25. David Ragan (Front Row Motorsports No. 38 Ford): Ragan has finished 30th or worse in four of his past five Brickyard 400s. But he sat on the pole in 2011 and started third in 2015.\n26. Michael McDowell (Front Row Motorsports No. 34 Ford): McDowell seeks his first top-15 finish at the Brickyard.\n27. Regan Smith (Leavine Family Racing No. 95 Chevrolet): Smith replaces Kasey Kahne, who is sitting out until he can understand what is causing him to be dehydrated to the point of being nauseated and having trouble seeing, which happened last weekend at Darlington. Smith has not turned a lap in any race car this year.\n28. Bubba Wallace (Richard Petty Motorsports No. 43 Chevrolet): Wallace has a 23rd and 14th in his two Xfinity starts at the track. He has never competed in a Cup race at Indy.\n29. Matt Kenseth (Roush Fenway Racing No. 6 Ford): Kenseth has finished a trio of second-place Brickyard finishes. He has five top-5s in his past seven Brickyard starts. Glory days.\n30. Ty Dillon (Germain Racing No. 13 Chevrolet): Dillon won an Xfinity race at the track in 2014. He finished 19th in this race a year ago. A 19th on Sunday would probably make him smile.\n31. Matt DiBenedetto (Go Fas Racing No. 32 Ford): One of DiBenedetto's career highlights was an eighth-place finish at the Brickyard last year. He announced Friday that he won't be back in the car next season.\n32. Ross Chastain (Premium Motorsports No. 15 Chevrolet): Chastain probably is looking more forward to racing an Xfinity car for Ganassi again next week than he is the Brickyard 400. But the learning experience will be important Sunday.\n33. Cole Whitt (TriStar Motorsports No. 72 Chevrolet): If this team can stay out of the bottom three among the charter teams (34th-36th), that makes the charter more valuable when it goes back to Front Row. Right now, it's seven points ahead of 34th StarCom and 13 points ahead of 35th BK Racing (now owned by Front Row)\n34. Landon Cassill (StarCom Racing No. 00 Chevrolet): This team also is looking to stay out of the bottom three -- if a charter is in the bottom three for three consecutive years, NASCAR can pull the charter.\n35. J.J. Yeley (BK Racing No. 23 Toyota): This will be Yeley's eighth start at the Brickyard. Make that eighth NASCAR start. He was ninth in the 1998 Indianapolis 500.\n36. David Starr (Rick Ware Racing No. 51 Chevrolet): This is Starr's first Cup race of 2018.\n37. Jeffrey Earnhardt (Gaunt Brothers Racing No. 96 Toyota): For the first time since the first five weeks, Earnhardt is racing in back-to-back events.\n38. Reed Sorenson (Premium Motorsports No. 7 Chevrolet): Sorenson is the youngest pole winner for any Cup race at the Brickyard. When he won the 2007 pole, he was 21 years, 5 months and 24 days old.\n39. Timmy Hill (Carl Long Motorsports No. 66 Toyota): This is Hill's fourth start at the Brickyard. He has been running at the finish of the previous three, including a 14th-place finish last year.\n40. B.J. McLeod (Rick Ware Racing No. 52 Chevrolet): He competed in this race last year and finished 32nd.",

    "https://www.advocate.com/religion/2019/2/27/mascot-mormon-university-byu-comes-out-gay": "As Brigham Young University\u2019s mascot, Cosmo the Cougar, Charlie Bird was the face of athletics at the nation\u2019s largest Mormon university, but he was hiding a significant part of his identity \u2014 that he was gay.\n\u201cAs scary as it seemed to dance in front of 60,000 people, an even scarier thought often crept into my mind \u2014 \u2018If they knew who I really was, would they hate me?\u2019\u201d Bird wrote in a commentary piece published Tuesday in Salt Lake City\u2019s Deseret News, in which he came out.\nBird was a popular mascot for the Utah university from 2015 to 2018, especially in his senior year, when videos of his dance routines were viewed by hundreds of millions of people on social media. \u201cI performed live on ESPN at the College Football Awards, and NBC Sports dubbed 2017-2018 the \u2018Year of the Mascot\u2019 in honor of Cosmo\u2019s viral influence,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhen I was Cosmo, I felt invincible.\u201d\nBut given the need to hide his sexual orientation, he had different feelings out of costume. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (the formal name of the Mormon Church) is less than friendly toward LGBTQ people. It expects members to refrain from same-sex relationships, and as for transgender people, it considers gender fixed at birth and immutable. Bird often heard insensitive comments about LGBTQ people.\n\u201cThe same community that made me feel like a superstar often simultaneously made me feel broken, unloved and defective,\u201d he wrote.\nHe became involved with a group of students and administrators working to make BYU more inclusive. The group received permission to hold the first campus discussion on LGBTQ issues, and he has heard encouraging words from some Mormon leaders, including Elder M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.\n\u201cWhile I am grateful for the progress, I feel we \u2014 as a community, state and country \u2014 still have a long way to go,\u201d he continued. Specifically, he wrote, \u201cWe must recognize that members of the LGBTQ community are present and participating in both academic and religious discussions. We must learn that showing empathy and support is not a compromise of moral values. We must \u2018comfort those that stand in need of comfort.\u2019\u201d\nIt could be credibly argued that the LDS Church is not making progress but going backward, with a policy of denying baptism to most children of same-sex couples and with leaders saying LGBTQ activism comes from Satan. But these topics did not come up in his essay or in a follow-up interview with Salt Lake City\u2019s other daily, The Salt Lake Tribune, and Bird remains committed to working for change within the church. Since the essay was published, he has received \u201cmany, many, many\u201d messages of support from LGBTQ church members and families with LGBTQ children, he told the Tribune.\nWhile the piece in the Deseret News (which is owned by the LDS Church) marked his public coming-out, Bird had started opening up about being gay to certain friends and associates at BYU late in his senior year and \u201creceived nothing but love and support from coaches, teammates, and athletic administration,\u201d he noted to the Tribune.\n\u201cI have somehow been blessed with an amazing platform where I can make my voice heard,\u201d Bird, who now works for a consulting firm in New York City, added in the interview. \u201cI wanted to make sure I used that platform to give a voice to people who don\u2019t have that same opportunity, and share a very real story of what many people are going through.\u201d",

The ideal scenario is to find a man to loan in for a season or two and then sign him on a permanent deal once you have the cash.\nHow to make a loan signing\nNo transfer fee is required in signing a player on loan. First go to the transfers tab, and you can either search for a specific player or see which have been loan listed in the market. Find the player you want, put him on your shortlist.\nAdvertisement\nHead to the Transfer Hub where you can compare all the players on your shortlist. On the player you want to loan in, select \u2018approach to loan\u2019 (or \u2018delegate to loan\u2019 if you want your assistant to handle negotiations). You will then meet with the manager or representative of the player\u2019s club to discuss the loan length, and the wage split of the player. Agree on those and the player will join your squad in the coming days. You cannot however, make a loan deal with an option to buy.\nHow to choose the best loan signing on FIFA 19\u2019s Career Mode\nIt was tough work finding the best potential loanees on Career Mode this year, but FIFA 19 has made it more realistic. Many of the players you will see were either on loan last season or linked with a move this past summer, with others just young prospects at big clubs. All of our loan signings have an overall of at least 65 with a potential to reach at least 80, meaning they should grow quickly at your club.\nRuben Loftus-Cheek (OVR 77 \u2013 POT 85)\nAge: 22\nPositions: CM, LM\nAdvertisement\nClub: Chelsea\nCountry: England\nWork rate: Medium/Low\nBest stats: 83 short passing, 82 dribbling, 81 long passing\nWage: \u00a374,000 a week\nRuben Loftus-Cheek is the best loan signing on the game and judging on his year at Crystal Palace it's no wonder why. The central or left midfielder\u2019s 25 appearances under Roy Hodgson last season were the most he has ever made in a campaign, with his two goals and five assists earning him a first England call-up and then a trip to the World Cup in the summer.\nOn FIFA 19, Loftus-Cheek\u2019s stats of 83 short passing, 82 dribbling and 81 long passing give him a 77 overall rating, which can grow to a potential of 85. His wages of \u00a374,000 a week may be off-putting, but you can manipulate the wage split in your favour.\nAdvertisement\nRenato Sanches (OVR 75 \u2013 POT 84)\nAge: 21\nPositions: CM\nClub: Bayern Munich\nCountry: Portugal\nWork rate: High/High\nAdvertisement\nBest stats: 90 aggression, 86 stamina, 85 shot power\nWage: \u00a340,000 a week\nAnother man who was out on loan last season, Renato Sanches had a tough time at Swansea as he made just 15 appearances and suffered relegation from the Premier League. It has been tricky since the central midfielder moved to Bayern Munich from Benfica for \u00a328 million aged 18, but with new manager Niko Kovac rotating the squad, Sanches looks to be getting his opportunity this year.\nSanches has a 75 overall on the game, which can grow to a very strong 84 on Career Mode. His attributes of 90 aggression, 86 stamina and 85 shot power mean the Portuguese\u2019s wages are \u00a340,000 a week.\nChidozie Awaziem (OVR 74 \u2013 POT 81)\nAge: 21\nAdvertisement\nPositions: CB\nClub: Porto\nCountry: Nigeria\nWork rate: Medium/High\nBest stats: 77 aggression, 77 strength, 75 standing tackle\nWage: \u00a38,000 a week\nYou may not have heard of Chidozie Awaziem, but the centre back\u2019s impressive season on loan at Nantes has brought him into the first team fold at Porto. The 21-year-old made 23 appearances in France last year as Nantes finished just three points outside the European places, but is yet to play for Porto this season.\nAdvertisement\nAwaziem has abilities of 77 aggression, 77 strength and 75 standing tackle on FIFA 19, taking him to a 74 overall which can improve to an 81 potential. His wages of \u00a38,000 a week mean you should have no issue in getting hold of him.\nFederico Valverde (OVR 73 \u2013 POT 83)\nAge: 20\nPositions: CM, LM, CAM\nClub: Real Madrid\nCountry: Uruguay\nAdvertisement\nWork rate: Medium/Medium\nBest stats: 79 long passing, 78 long shots, 78 short passing\nWage: \u00a354,000 a week\nFew will be aware Uruguay international Federico Valverde is at Real Madrid, after the central, left and attacking midfielder enjoyed some minutes on loan at Deportivo La Coruna last year. He couldn\u2019t save them from relegation however, but did enough in pre-season to seal a spot in the Real Madrid squad for the season.\nLook for a decent split on Valverde\u2019s \u00a354,000 a week wages, entitling you to his 73 overall and 83 potential. His best attributes include 79 long passing, 78 long shots and 78 short passing.\nAlessandro Murgia (OVR 72 \u2013 POT 80)\nAdvertisement\nAge: 22\nPositions: CM, CDM\nClub: Lazio\nCountry: Italy\nWork rate: Medium/Medium\nBest stats: 75 short passing, 74 ball control, 74 reactions\nWage: \u00a321,000 a week\nAdvertisement\nAlessandro Murgia has already made close to 50 appearances for Lazio, but has made just two appearances so far this season. The competition of Lucas Leiva (OVR 83), Marco Parolo (OVR 82), Milan Badelj (OVR 80) and Danilo Cataldi (OVR 75) looks to be too much for the central and defensive midfielder, allowing you to snap him up on loan,\n75 short passing, 74 ball control and 74 reactions take Murgia to a 72 overall, rising to a potential of 80. The 22-year-old\u2019s wages are currently \u00a321,000 a week.\nScott McTominay (OVR 71 \u2013 POT 81)\nAge: 21\nPositions: CM, CDM\nClub: Manchester United\nAdvertisement\nCountry: Scotland\nWork rate: Medium/Medium\nBest stats: 78 strength, 75 short passing, 74 vision\nWage: \u00a345,000 a week\nScott McTominay always seems to impress whenever he plays for Manchester United and is one of the very few success stories under Jose Mourinho at the club. Now a Scottish international, McTominay has made 28 appearances for the Red Devils, playing the full 90 minutes last season in wins over Chelsea and Liverpool.\nMcTominay has a 71 overall on the game, which can improve to a potential of 81. His wages of \u00a345,000 come with stats of 78 strength, 75 short passing and 74 vision.\nOleksandr Zinchenko (OVR 71 \u2013 POT 81)\nAdvertisement\nAge: 21\nPositions: LB, CAM, LWB\nClub: Manchester City\nCountry: Ukraine\nWork rate: High/Medium\nBest stats: 79 balance, 79 crossing, 78 vision\nWage: \u00a340,000 a week\nAdvertisement\nOleksandr Zinchenko was subject to a loan bid from Wolves in the summer, but the Manchester City man elected to fight for his place at the Etihad. With Benjamin Mendy (OVR 81) back from injury this season, appearances will be hard to come by, but the Ukranian has shown versatility in transitioning from an attacking midfielder into a left back or wing-back.\nThe 21-year-old Zinchenko has attributes of 79 balance, 79 crossing and 78 vision to give him a 71 overall. This can improve to an 81 potential on the game, costing a split on his wages of \u00a340,000 for the season.\nJoao Felix (OVR 70 \u2013 POT 87)\nAge: 18\nPositions: LW, CAM\nClub: Benfica\nAdvertisement\nCountry: Portugal\nWork rate: High/Low\nBest stats: 83 agility, 80 sprint speed, 78 jumping\nWage: \u00a35,000 a week\nJoao Felix looks be a top talent, with the 18-year-old making his Benfica first team debut this season, scoring two goals in his first six games for the club. The left winger or attacking midfielder is a Portuguese U21 international, scoring three times in seven appearances.\nFelix\u2019s overall of 70 consists of 83 agility, 80 sprint speed and 78 jumping. Those will improve very quickly as he nears his 87 potential, and will cost a maximum of just \u00a35,000 a week wages for the season.\nDominic Solanke (OVR 70 \u2013 POT 84)\nAdvertisement\nAge: 21\nPositions: ST\nClub: Liverpool\nCountry: England\nWork rate: High/Medium\nBest stats: 73 shot power, 73 dribbling, 72 strength\nWage: \u00a344,000 a week\nAdvertisement\nDominic Solanke hasn\u2019t had the easiest time at Liverpool, waiting patiently for his opportunity behind the formidable front three of Mohamed Salah (OVR 88), Roberto Firmino (OVR 86) and Sadio Mane (OVR 86). The 21-year-old had to wait until the final game of last season to notch his first Liverpool goal, but his performances at youth level (10 goals in 15 for England U20s) saw him receive a shock England call-up last November.\nFormer Chelsea man Solanke has stats of 73 shot power, 73 dribbling and 72 strength to take him to a 70 overall. His potential of 84 should be enough for you to take a chance on his wages of \u00a344,000 a week.\nKieran Dowell (OVR 70 \u2013 POT 83)\nAge: 20\nPositions: CAM\nClub: Everton\nAdvertisement\nCountry: England\nWork rate: Medium/Low\nBest stats: 74 dribbling, 73 long shots, 73 vision\nWage: \u00a337,000 a week\nNot a familiar Premier League name, with Everton\u2019s Kieran Dowell spending last season on loan at Nottingham Forest in the Championship. The attacking midfielder scored nine goals and had four assists in 38 league games last season, which have seen him come into Marco Silva\u2019s plans on Merseyside for the new campaign.\nDowell, 20, has a 70 overall and a potential of 83. His abilities of 74 dribbling, 73 long shots and 73 vision will cost you a cut of his \u00a337,000 a week wages.\nAll the best FIFA 19 loan signings",

However, despite coming up short in acquiring a second-round pick, the Cavaliers did manage to sign three undrafted players for their summer league roster that offer plenty of intriguing possibilities.\nThose three players are: forward Billy Preston from the University of Kansas; forward Bonzie Colson from the University of Notre Dame; and guard Dakota Mathias from Purdue University. The 6-foot-10 Preston never actually played an official game for the Jayhawks before he left due to off-the-court issues and then playing overseas. Both the 6-foot-6 Colson and 6-foot-4 Mathias played four years at their respective schools.\nPreston is a former five-star recruit who has plenty of raw athletic talent when it comes to shooting, shot-blocking and defense. Colson racked up plenty of double-doubles during his time with the Fighting Irish, but missed most of this past season\u2019s second half due to injury. Despite his size, he\u2019s reported to have a 7-foot wingspan. Rounding out this trio, Mathias was a long-range threat for the Boilermakers and could potentially develop as an eventual replacement for the 37-year-old Kyle Korver.\nThe best-case scenario for the three players is that they make the final roster in October. However, a more realistic appraisal is that the trio develops their professional game for the year with the Canton Charge, the Cavaliers\u2019 G League affiliate.\nCavs fans will be able to watch the three players when the team\u2019s summer league squad begins their brief schedule in Las Vegas next month.",

The Rajkot administration earlier issued a ban on the game in public places and sent suggestions to other state governments for applying a complete ban on the game.\nBy Amritanshu Mukherjee: Earlier in the day, reports of the Rajkot police nabbing 10 youngsters for playing PUBG came in. The police arrested 10 individuals who were found to play PUBG on their smartphones in the public place. The arrests were made based on the charges issued under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code for violating an order issued by the Police Commissioner and Section 35 for playing PUBG despite the ban by the Gujarat Police Act. The game was banned in Rajkot by the Police Commissioner a few days ago.\nadvertisement\nPUBG was in the news for a long time since reports of the game spoiling youngsters as well as grown-ups. The game has been often accused of spreading violence among children and has led them to divert attention from academics, affecting their overall development. PUBG has been framed to be highly addictive even for grown-ups. The negative-effects of PUBG have been so concerning that a concerned mother recently took the issue to Indian PM Narendra Modi in the \"Pariksha Pe Charcha 2.0\" event.\nIf you have been wondering why a ban was implemented on PUBG, here's all you need to know the \"PUBG Ban\" chapter.\nWhat is PUBG?\nPlayerUnknown's BattleGround, widely known as PUBG to the world, was introduced last year on PC, consoles and mobile platforms. PUBG belongs to the battle royale genre where players jump along with 99 other players on a virtual battlefield and fight it out amongst themselves. The last man standing wins the match. Unlike other battle royale games, PUBG offers a military-themed realistic experience. PUBG is available for free on mobile platforms and is available for Rs 999 on Steam.\nWhy is PUBG being banned?\nSince its introduction, PUBG has been considered as one of the most popular games, both on mobiles as well as PC. The game's immense popularity has led to the development of communities who live and breathe PUBG. The multiplayer gameplay mode encourages friends to play along with each other. And that's where the problem rises.\nPUBG has been accused of causing distraction from academics among youngsters. The violent nature of the game has also been under suspicion for altering children's behaviour. Additionally, grown-ups have also been reported to be affected by the game badly, with some of them even being hospitalised due to the game's addiction.\nReported incidents of PUBG's negative effects\n--A fitness trainer in Jammu was traumatized while playing the game. The man started punching himself after getting addicted to the game and injured himself badly. He had to be hospitalised and underwent medical treatment.\n--A teenager in Mumbai committed suicide after his parents denied of purchasing an expensive smartphone to play PUBG.\n--A Malaysian man was reported to leave his family and his pregnant wife after he was \"disturbed\" from playing PUBG.\nWhere has the ban been implemented yet\nSo far, the biggest news of PUBG ban is coming from Gujarat, where the Rajkot administration has issued a formal ban on the game. The police have been directed to make arrests if someone is seen playing PUBG in public places.\nadvertisement\nGujarat's primary education department also issued a circular to ban the game after the recommendation of the Gujarat State Commission for Protection of Child Rights. The district education officers have been tasked to carry necessary measures to ban the game in schools.\nThe Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) was also reported to ban the game inside its campus.\nPublic reaction\nBroadly, it has been mixed.\n--A section of the public, including parents, authorities and some children have welcomed the ban. Some people on Twitter have been expressing their emotions, agreeing that game's negative effect on the lives of its players has been noticeable and a ban would certainly help youngsters get back on track. \"I completely support the criminalising of PUBG. Such games have a negative impact on the minds of people like me who are unable to play it well, despite of the tremendous peer pressure,\" wrote one user.\n--However, a majority of people have raised their voice against the ban. Many have argued that a ban isn't the only solution to a game that's deemed harmful to the people. There is no official proof to suggest that PUBG is dangerous. Some have even questioned the government's take on the issue of Internet freedom. Check out some of these tweets below:\nadvertisement\nYes, #PUBG players are being arrested in Gujarat as per news reports. Criminalising the use of gaming technologies is massive blow to individual liberty.

Why don\u2019t you play with some heart? You should all be f---ing ashamed.\u201d\nWallabies coach Michael Cheika told the media he didn\u2019t expect Lukhan Tui will join the team for their Rugby Championship tour after indicating his desire to sit out the remainder of the season.\nA distraught Tui told teammates he needed to take a break from rugby after his altercation with a spectator who had allegedly pushed his sister moments after Saturday night\u2019s 23-19 defeat to Argentina.\nIt was an ugly end to an already emotional week for Tui\u2019s family - his stepfather died suddenly on Wednesday and the Wallabies wore black armbands in his honour during the game on the Gold Coast.\nTui was still able to take his place in the starting team and played the full 80 minutes at blindside flanker.\nBut Cheika said the 21-year-old addressed the playing group after the match, telling them he needed to take time away from rugby and would cut his 2018 campaign short.\nThat means sitting out trips to South Africa and Argentina later this month - two hugely important clashes for a Wallabies team in the thick of a horrendous patch of form.\nCheika is hopeful he can talk Tui around but, as things stand, he doesn\u2019t anticipate he will play in either of those matches.\n\u201cThat remains to be seen. We\u2019ll see how the week pans out and go from there,\u201d he told reporters at Brisbane airport on Sunday.\n\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s unlikely, based on what we spoke about last night.\u201d Cheika said he hadn\u2019t seen or spoken to Tui since the match. \u201cI think it\u2019s very unfortunate, the combination of factors - the game itself, also (Tui\u2019s) situation,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about the fan or what he said or anything.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t like to see that in the game.\n\u201cHis stepfather\u2019s just passed away ... he needs to just be with his family and be together.\u201d Rugby Australia is seeking CCTV vision from inside the stadium and will await reports from venue security before determining what course of action will be taken.\nPolice were on hand and took details but did not arrest either supporter. \u201cI don\u2019t know the details of exactly what happened. As they do in all the grounds in Australia they\u2019ll take a look at it and the people at the ground, they\u2019re responsible for that stuff,\u201d Cheika said.",

Live & anytime in HD. Get your 14-day free trial and start streaming instantly >\nCarlton burst out of the blocks against Western Bulldogs before leading from start to finish to win their first game since Round 19 last year \u2014 267 days ago \u2014 by 44 points.\nFittingly it was No. 1 draft pick Sam Walsh who slammed home a goal right on the final siren to break the Blues\u2019 60-game drought without a three figure score.\nAfter winning only two games during a disastrous 2018, this was a win to savour for Carlton and Brendon Bolton, who has been under more pressure than any other man in football this season.\nIt might have been all about the showdown between Brownlow Medal favourites Patrick Cripps and Marcus Bontempelli before the opening bounce, but it was all about the Carlton skipper and young gun Sam Petrevski-Seton by the final siren.\nCripps continued to show why he is considered by some as the best player in the game right now, while Petrevski-Seton played like the two-time Brownlow medallist who he inherited the iconic No. 5 from.\nThe West Australian duo tore the Western Bulldogs apart in the opening half, amassing 51 disposals between them before Cripps finished with 37 and Petrevski-Seton 35.\nIt was almost as stunning as the result.\nSam Petrevski-Seton played his best game in the navy blue against the Bulldogs.

Source: Getty Images\nBut it didn\u2019t come without a period of unease for long-suffering Carlton supporters.\nA sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu swept through Marvel Stadium in the third quarter.\nAfter coughing up a three-goal lead in a low scoring affair at Metricon Stadium last weekend, lightning looked like it might strike twice on Sunday.\nBilly Gowers had two shots at goal \u2014 and missed both \u2014 before Sam Lloyd and Tory Dickson reduced the margin to three goals and the Dogs had all the momentum.\nBut then Petreveski-Seton \u2014 the man of the moment \u2014 intercepted a switch kick from Caleb Daniel just inside the arc. He went back and added another layer to the best day of his football life.\n\u201cPS, this is a big kick,\u201d North Melbourne legend Wayne Carey said on Triple M.\n\u201cThat is a clutch kick from Sam Petreveski-Seton,\u201d North Melbourne and Sydney great Wayne Schwass added.\nThe Halls Creek product wasn\u2019t the only green shoot who delivered when they needed it most on Sunday.\nWith Carlton\u2019s great white hope Charlie Curnow forced to withdrawal before the opening bounce due to another issue with his knee, Harry McKay showed why he was taken at Pick 10 in the 2015 National Draft.\nMcKay terrorised the Western Bulldogs\u2019 undersized defence. He kicked goals \u2014 slotting an equal career-high four goals \u2014 and he took big marks \u2014 reeling in\n\u201cThey say they take long for big guys \u2026 but let\u2019s hope this is the year where McKay completely breaks out and comes a consistent key position performer,\u201d Jason Dunstall said on Fox Footy.\nGet the ultimate AFL experience on your phone with the FOX FOOTY App. Download it NOW for FREE on iOS and Android!\nHarry McKay booted four goals for Carlton. Photo: Julian Smith/AAP Image. Source: AAP\n\u201cHe is just improving, each and every week. He could be a phenomena inside that forward line. He\u2019s just a brilliant kick, he\u2019s more skilled than people have given him credit for,\u201d Gerard Healy added.\nOn a weekend where St Kilda moved to the top of the ladder, where Port Adelaide stunned West Coast and Fremantle upset Greater Western Sydney, this wasn\u2019t the biggest shock, but it will be the story to emerge from the Easter weekend.\nAnd in case the 22 in navy blue had forgotten how to sing the song, Carlton supporters started screaming out the lyrics in the dying moments, in another moment to savour.\nSILVAGNI RETURN\nJack Silvagni, the son of Carlton legend and list manager Stephen Silvagni, hadn\u2019t had a look in across the first month of the season, following a patchy 2018. But on Sunday afternoon, Silvagni showed he still has plenty to offer at AFL level. After being played here, there and everywhere last year, he played in attack against the Western Bulldogs, where he finished with 18 disposals, nine marks, four assists and a goal.\nHAYES DEBUT\nIt took Will Hayes five years on Footscray\u2019s VFL list to finally get a crack on the Western Bulldogs\u2019 list. But it only took him two hours to show why he belongs at this level. The son of champion horse trainer David Hayes racked up nine touches in the opening quarter alone, before finishing with 21 for the day in a bright debut.\nSHOWING THE LOVE\nCarlton supporters erupted midway through the second quarter when Brendon Bolton ran down the boundary line, flanked by two bald, unathletic security guards who looked like the muscle men out of Ocean\u2019s Eleven. They then stood as one and cheered the Blues off the ground at half-time. That themed continued across the second half, especially when Carlton looked home in the last quarter. They started singing the song at the 18-minute mark of the final term and some were still singing it long after the crowd dispersed.\nRe-live Western Bulldogs v Carlton in our live blog below.\nIf you can\u2019t see the blog, tap here.",

    "https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/buy-a-pixel-2-instead-of-an-iphone-x/": "Sometimes, you just need a friend to convince you that you're right. Over the past months, I've had a few friends who are \"lifelong\" iPhone users message me and ask about switching away from Apple. They want to break their biannual iPhone upgrade cycle and eschew the new iPhone X for the Google Pixel 2. One of my friends wrote me this:\n\"I'm really over Apple iPhones. I'm kind of into the Pixel 2, but that's only on Verizon, right? I don't like their unlimited plans. I like the iPhone X, but don't want it.\"\nAfter receiving a handful of similar messages, I decided to take this Pixel pining seriously and share my experiences with both phones. This comparison is less about proving which phone is \"better,\" and more about why the Pixel 2 is a solid upgrade for someone who's always owned an iPhone.\nNote that rumors about the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL are starting to surface and though we can reasonably expect the Pixel 3 to launch this October, these are still only rumors for now.\nSo much cheaper\nLet's start with cost. A new 64GB Pixel 2 is $350, \u00a3370 or AU$500 cheaper than a 64GB iPhone X. The chart below compares the prices for the Pixel 2 and iPhone X. The Pixel 2's price is exactly the same as what a base level-iPhone used to cost until the iPhone 8.\nPixel 2 and iPhone X prices\nPixel 2 64GB Pixel 2 128GB iPhone X 64GB iPhone X 256GB US price $649 $749 $999 $1,149 UK price \u00a3629 \u00a3729 \u00a3999 \u00a31,149 Australia price AU$1,079 AU$1,229 AU$1,579 AU$1,829\nI should acknowledge that Google makes a larger version of its phone with the same processor and camera called the Pixel 2 XL. A 64GB version of the XL costs $849, \u00a3799 or AU$1,399. At launch the Pixel 2 XL suffered some screen issues which the Pixel 2 did not.\nApple also makes the iPhone 8, which has the same processor and wide-angle camera as the iPhone X. A 64GB iPhone 8 costs $699, \u00a3699, AU$1,079, which is more in line with the cost of a Pixel 2.\nBut my iPhone friends weren't interested in the Pixel 2 XL or the iPhone 8. For them, it's either the iPhone X or the Pixel 2.\nCarrier support\nThere seems to be a little confusion over which US networks support the Pixel 2. You can buy and finance an unlocked Pixel 2 from Google and use it on AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon and Google Project Fi. Some third-party retailers like Best Buy sell and finance unlocked Pixel 2 phones, too. And there's always Verizon, which sells the handset to use only on its network.\nThe iPhone X can be bought and financed from Apple, third-party retailers and all major carriers.\nNotch vs. forehead\nBoth phones are nearly identical in size. The iPhone X is a hair slimmer and smaller but has a bigger display -- 5.8 inches compared to the Pixel 2's 5 inches. The iPhone X is heftier, weighing 31 grams, 1.09 ounces more than the Pixel 2.\nThe design of the Pixel 2 is consistent with the way phones have looked for the past three to five years. On the front, there's a pronounced forehead, chin and bezels. The corners are rounded and there's a rear fingerprint sensor. Despite this dated formula, the phone's fit and finish make it look contemporary -- especially the small glass panel on the back that houses the camera.\nI also love the plastic-clad aluminum texture of the Pixel 2's lower back. It's reassuring and comfortable to hold. I bring this up because I have an unspoken anxiety holding the iPhone X. I'm so afraid of dropping it. In a CNET drop test, the iPhone X's glass back cracked on the first drop. But when I hold the Pixel 2, I don't feel that same unease.\nThe iPhone X is basically all glass with a stainless steel band that really ties the phone together. It looks like a prop from a futuristic sci-fi movie or a piece of jewelry. The screen, aside from \"the notch,\" covers the front and is framed by the tiniest of bezels. The only buttons on the phone are alongside the edges.\nIn lieu of a home button, Apple added on-screen actions. During my first few days with the phone, I found these new gestures frustrating, but now they're like second nature. Apple replaced the fingerprint sensor (previously built into the home button) with FaceID. The phone unlocks as soon as you look at the screen. It works like a charm for me, but if you think you'll miss unlocking your phone with a fingerprint, the Pixel 2 is a better fit.\nSpeakers on both phones are decent and louder than the original Pixel and the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. But neither phone offers the big, rich sound of, say, the Razer Phone.\nFast charging vs. headphones\nThe Pixel 2 comes with a fast charger that can add 7 hours of battery life after 15 minutes of charging. The iPhone X supports fast charging, but doesn't come with the cable or wall charger you'll need to make it work. You have to buy a USB-C to Lighting cable ($25, \u00a325, AU$35) and a 29-watt charger ($49, \u00a349, AU$69).\nThe iPhone X is capable of wireless charging with a conductive charging mat (also not included). The Pixel 2 doesn't support this, but with that 15-minute top-off mentioned above, I don't think you'll miss it.\nBelow is what comes in the box for an iPhone X and Pixel 2:\nWhat's in the box\niPhone X Pixel 2 Wall charger 5W USB 18W USB-C Charging cable Lightning to USB USB-C to USB-C Headphones Yes, with Lightning connector None Headphone Jack Adapter Lightning to 3.5mm USB-C to 3.5mm Extras None Quick switch adapter\nNeither phone has a headphone jack, but both come with an adapter so you can still plug in your wired headphones. The iPhone X also comes bundled with Lightning-connected earbuds, while the Pixel 2 doesn't come with any. If you don't have an old pair you can use, you'll need to spend more money.\nApple also sells wireless earbuds called AirPods ($159, \u00a3159, AU$229), while Google offers its own wireless headphones called Google Buds ($159, \u00a3159, AU$249).\nSo what's the takeaway here? Whatever phone you go with, you'll need to embrace dongle life. But...\nAndroid Oreo is good\nThe biggest change you need to consider is not the physical phones themselves, but how you're going to switch operating systems -- namely to Android. For seasoned iPhone owners, older versions of Android had a reputation of being chaotic and less secure. Early Android, depending on the phone, could be a dumpster fire full of bugs, belated updates and bloatware apps from carriers and manufacturers.\nCNET\nBut that has changed with Android Oreo. It runs just as well on the Pixel 2 as iOS 11 does on the iPhone X.\nYou might also miss Apple-centric features such as iMessage and FaceTime -- especially if you have friends and family who use them heavily.\nBut other than leaving behind the blue bubbles, Android Oreo and iOS 11 are well matched in every way when it comes to features, security and ease of use.\nSince Google makes both the hardware and software, like Apple, the company is good about sending regular updates to Android.\niPhone X has Apple Pay and Siri, while the Pixel 2 has Android Pay and Google Assistant, the latter of which can run on an iPhone, too. If you're an Apple Music subscriber the service is available on Android.\nIf you have a lot of apps or games you bought on iOS, you'll need to repurchase them on Android. This isn't as big a deal as it was a few years ago since most apps are \"free\" with in-app purchases.\nSwitching from one to the other will inevitably mean a small learning curve. But Android Oreo will likely surprise most iOS users with its stability and feature set.\nFor more about switching from iOS to Android, check out our how-to article with tips and tricks.\nGoogle recently announced Android P, its next major update. Apple will likely release its first developer version of the next iOS at the Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) next week.\nThe best cameras\nThe Pixel 2 has a single rear camera compared to the dual-rear cameras on the iPhone X. Both phones are capable of capturing fantastic photos and videos. Yet, to my eye, the Pixel 2 takes better photos than the iPhone X.\nI prefer how Pixel 2 pictures have more detail and sharpness thanks to the way it processes photos with AI. That doesn't mean the iPhone X is a slouch. It's better at zoomed photos because its second camera has a telephoto lens and allows for 2x optical zoom. Zooming on the Pixel 2 isn't always pretty, but it's better than other digital zooms.\nBoth phones have Portrait Mode, which gives pictures an artificial shallow depth of field mimicking photos taken with a DSLR camera and a fast lens.\nThe iPhone X creates this effect better. Portraits have a gradual transition between the subject and the background which looks more like a DSLR portrait. Apple also lets you adjust lighting effects after the fact to make a portrait photo really pop.\nThe Pixel 2 separates the background and foreground with a laser-like precision. This can sometimes look a bit artificial or Photoshop-ish. But there is something dramatic and appealing about the results, too.\nAlso, the iPhone X takes amazing Portrait Mode photos of fish.\nThe front-facing camera on each phone also has Portrait Mode, too. Here, the Pixel 2 bests what the iPhone X can produce in every way. Pixel 2 selfie portraits are just as good as what its rear camera can produce. iPhone X selfie portraits unfortunately don't always nail the \"background blur\" effect.\nAs for video, the iPhone X is the king, and offers better image quality and more shooting options. On the other hand, the Pixel 2's video stabilization is the best around.\nLonger battery vs. faster processor\nThe iPhone X's A11 chip blows away the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor in the Pixel 2. In actual use, though, it's hard to tell the difference. Neither phone feels slower than the other.\nPixel 2 and iPhone X speed tests\niPhone X Pixel 2 GeekBench 4 single-core 4,232 1,917 Geekbench 4 multi-core 10,329 6,396 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited 63,446 39,267\nIn our looped video battery tests, the Pixel 2 lasted 13 hours, 28 minutes compared to the iPhone X lasting only 11 hours, 45 minutes. That's not a huge difference. In real life, I never had trouble with either phone getting through a full day of use without charging.\nThe extras\nThe Pixel 2 comes with a connector to transfer media and files from your old iPhone to your new Google phone. Also if you run out of space for your photos and videos, know that you get unlimited Google cloud storage with your purchase of the Pixel 2.\nSarah Tew/CNET\nThe phone can also be used with a Daydream View headset ($149, \u00a399, AU$149). The headset is covered in cloth and has a tiny Black Mirror-style remote. You can access VR content from YouTube, Netflix, the New York Times (my favorite) and more. Though it's fun to use, I ended up using the Daydream View as much as my slow cooker -- a lot for the first few weeks, but hardly at all ever since.\nLastly, the Pixel 2 supports ARCore apps and features Google Lens software that can overlay information about the world around you using the camera and Photos app.\nThe iPhone supports iOS AR apps and has FaceID, which allows for Animoji messages. Other than that though, it's pretty scant on integrating with AR and VR platforms.\nAppleCare for the iPhone X costs $200 and provides coverage for 2 years from date of purchase from any kind of damage. Google's \"Preferred Care\" costs $129 and covers the Pixel 2 for 30 months. But it lacks the convenience an actual Apple Store provides. While there isn't a Google Store with a Google Genius Bar for fast repair turnarounds, there is a round-the-clock live customer support system in place, which Pixel users can access in the Settings on the phone.\nOther phones exist, but...\niPhone 8\nEven though my friends are torn between a Pixel 2 and an iPhone X, it's worth acknowledging that an iPhone 8 and Pixel 2 are a better match-up in regards to price and design. The iPhone 8 has a polished take on the same reiterative design used by the iPhone 7, 6S and 6.\nThe insides of the iPhone 8 are pretty much identical to those of the iPhone X. In our battery tests, the iPhone 8 lasted an hour longer than the iPhone X when playing a looped-video at half brightness. Both phones have the same wide-angle camera, but the iPhone X also has a second rear camera and FaceID.\nPixel 2 XL\nThe Pixel 2 XL has a larger screen at 6 inches compared to the Pixel 2's 5-inch display. The bezels on the 2 XL are notably thinner, giving it a more modern look and feel than its little brother the Pixel 2. On the inside, everything is the same except the battery. The 2 XL has a 3,520mAh battery while the Pixel 2 has a smaller 2,700mAh one.\nGalaxy S9\nIt's also worth pointing out that Samsung newest phones, the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus, are now out. Both phones have a variable-aperture camera promising sharper images with everyday use. But the Pixel 2 still shot better photos in preliminary tests. CNET has extensive coverage of the new phones, but none of my iPhone-owning friends who wanted a Pixel 2 were interested in the Galaxy S9.\nThe Pixel 2 and its stock version of Android have a simple and clean mojo that appeals to an iPhone user more than Samsung's \"add everything\" approach.\n4 months away\nKeep in mind we're just past the halfway point between Apple and Google's last phone launches and their next ones. Apple typically releases a new iPhone in September, while Google has launched both of generations of the Pixel in October. But 4 months can be a long wait to upgrade your phone. Ultimately this comes down to you.\nBest Android phone for iPhone lovers\nThe Pixel 2 is the most iPhone-like phone I've seen on Android. It's a solid choice for someone used to living the Apple life. Upgrading to the Pixel 2 means that you'll save money, get the best phone camera for photos and have a device that doesn't needed to be coddled. Plus, Android Oreo packs a level of fit and finish that would surely surprise the most devout iOS user.\nOnce you decide to switch, all you need to do which color Pixel 2 you want.\nEditors' note: This story was originally published March 14, 2018, at 4 a.m. PT. One of the main questions I got about this article was how secure Android is versus iOS. Here is a story that CNET has since published that explores how Google has made Android as secure as iOS.\nI had a few people ask about warranty and software support for each phone. Google offers a two-year warranty out of the box on the Pixel 2 while Apple covers the iPhone X for just a year. However, Google only supports security updates on the Pixel 2 for \"at least three years.\" Apple hasn't shared how long new versions of iOS will support the iPhone X, but currently iOS 11 can run on phones as old as the iPhone 5S which was released four and a half years a go.",

    "https://www.cnet.com/culture/entertainment/pet-sematary-review-2019-horror-remake-digs-up-stephen-king-shocks/": "Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to honor the memory of the 1983 Stephen King novel Pet Sematary, but what's this? It's clawing out of the grave and lurching back to life!\nKing's chilling novel made it into theaters in 1989, and it's back for a 2019 remake. This new version is also part of the resurrection of King's stories on the big screen, as his much-loved horror best-sellers get a second go-round of movie adaptations following the success of It.\nGrief, loss and resurrection are at the heart of Pet Sematary, as an ordinary family wrestles with the dilemma of bringing back their loved ones, whatever the price.\nJason Clarke and Amy Seimetz are the parents who relocate to the countryside for a bit of peace and quiet. It's the oldest setup in the book: a family with a troubled past moves to an isolated house that harbors secrets of its own. There's a creepy neighbor, a creepy basement, a creepy forest -- everything but the creepy kitchen sink.\nCreepiest of all is the family cat, who becomes a disheveled but sinister presence in the family home. The audience is pretty much ahead of the story for the first half, but it's still an effective horror slow-burn. Things get spooky as next-door neighbor John Lithgow, alternating between avuncular and unsettling, reluctantly gives a glimpse into the nature of the horror. Small tests and small sacrifices lead to bigger tests -- and more extreme sacrifice.\nWhat makes the story stick is the killer premise. Even if you haven't read the book or seen the previous film version -- which I haven't -- you can still see what's coming. A terrible decision lies in wait for the family, and that horrifying temptation, that grim inevitability, irresistibly draws the characters and audience to peer into the shadows.\nWhen the characters do embrace the darkness, the film becomes like a fever dream shot in entertainingly delirious style. And then the next day dawns, and everyone has to live with the consequences.\nParamount\nThe first half does such a great job of building a sense of dread that once it passes the point of no return the film doesn't seem to know where to go. When it descends into the nightmare, the film promises a deliciously macabre second half in which the family members have to live with their terrible decision. But instead it fizzles out, separating the characters and diluting the tension before a strangely undramatic final conflict.\nAs much as it's updated with cell phones and laptops, Pet Sematary still has an old-school feel. The vaguely retro atmosphere even extends to the dark place looking like a soundstage shrouded in dry ice and littered with polystyrene rocks. There's also a slow-motion window smash that's straight out of the VHS era.\nNot all of the retro-ness works quite so well. There's a flashback-based subplot that looks oddly dated, even if it does provide a few shocks.\nThe film is also littered with little details that demand your attention and then lead nowhere. Are they red herrings? Are they Stephen King Easter eggs? Are they carelessly forgotten plot threads? The answer will be different for each viewer. In fact, there are so many odd little things left hanging it almost feels like a choose-your-own-adventure story, like next time you watch the ending will be different. Maybe next time the ending will be less of an anticlimax.\nThe resolution may not live up to the promise of the earlier dread and horror, but this revived Pet Sematary is well worth digging up.\nOriginally published April 4.",

    "https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/2/26/18241904/lake-erie-legal-rights-personhood-nature-environment-toledo-ohio": "It started in a pub. A handful of people, hunched over beers in Toledo, Ohio, were talking about a water crisis that had plagued the city in 2014. The pollution of Lake Erie had gotten so bad that it had taken a serious toll on their lives. The government, they felt, wasn\u2019t doing enough to protect the lake. And so they wondered: What if the lake could protect itself?\nThe idea they hatched that night ultimately resulted in a special election, which had the citizens of Toledo voting February 26 on a very unusual question: Should Lake Erie be granted the legal rights normally reserved for a person?\nThe measure passed easily, which means citizens will be able to sue on behalf of the lake whenever its right to flourish is being contravened \u2014 that is, whenever it\u2019s in danger of major environmental harm.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nervous energy,\u201d Tish O\u2019Dell, who was at the pub that fateful night, told me while traveling between different polling places in Toledo on the morning of the vote. She was on tenterhooks as she waited for the election results. \u201cIt\u2019s like torture.\u201d\nIf the stakes felt almost unbearably high for the activists who pushed for the Lake Erie Bill of Rights, it\u2019s because this was the first rights-based legislation aimed at protecting a whole US ecosystem: the lake, its tributaries, and the many species that live off it.\nThe law isn\u2019t without precedent, though. It\u2019s part of the nascent rights of nature movement, which has notched several victories in the past dozen years. Rivers and forests have already won legal rights in countries like Ecuador, Colombia, India, and New Zealand.\nActivists in the movement often argue that the environment is the next frontier in humanity\u2019s expanding moral circle: over the centuries, we\u2019ve extended rights to more and more beings, so why shouldn\u2019t nature itself be next?\nThey reject the conventional Western way of relating to nature \u2014 as property that is ours for the taking, as an object rather than a subject \u2014 but they recognize they\u2019re going to have to work within the existing Western legal system if they want that to change. They\u2019re betting that the best strategy for protecting the environment is to stretch our society\u2019s understanding of what counts as a person. It\u2019s a bold bet, but with climate change decimating the planet at such a ferocious rate, it might be the kind of innovative thinking we need.\nHow the rights of nature idea took off\nIn 1972, the case of Sierra Club v. Morton came before the US Supreme Court, leading to a deliberation over whether nature should have its own rights. The Court decided the answer was no, but Justice William O. Douglas dissented. \u201cContemporary public concern for protecting nature\u2019s ecological equilibrium,\u201d he wrote, \u201cshould lead to the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation.\u201d\nThat same year, law professor Christopher Stone made a splash with an article titled \u201cShould trees have standing?\u201d It catalyzed other academics to write a slew of articles and books considering whether natural environments ought to have rights enshrined in law.\nIn 2006, that question left the ether of academia and came to bear directly on toxic sewage sludge, which had been dumped in Tamaqua, Pennsylvania. Residents fought for \u2014 and won \u2014 the first-ever rights of nature law in the world. Two years later, Ecuador became the first country to enshrine the rights of nature in its constitution, thanks in large part to the work of indigenous activists.\nSince then, the victories have come fast and furious. In 2014, New Zealand recognized the legal rights of the Te Urewera forest. In 2017, Colombia granted rights to the Rio Atrato river and India recognized the Ganges and Yamuna rivers as legal persons. In 2018, the Amazon rainforest got its own rights, and for the first time, so did a specific plant species: the wild rice known as manoomin, one of the Anishinaabe people\u2019s staple crops.\nGranting the status of personhood to a natural environment may seem like a bizarre legal fiction, but it\u2019s no more bizarre than the idea that corporations should enjoy that same status, which has been with us since the 1880s.\nIf we find it strange to view nature the way we view people, that may just be because we\u2019ve grown up in an anthropocentric intellectual tradition that treats the natural world as an object to be examined and exploited for human use, rather than as a subject to be communed with and respected.\n\u201cThe idea that we can be separate from nature is really a Western reductionist way of looking at the world \u2014 we can trace it back to Francis Bacon and the scientific method,\u201d said Ben Price, the national director for the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund, a nonprofit public interest law firm that helps people facing threats to their local environment.\nPrice told me that just as women\u2019s suffrage or the abolition of slavery were once unthinkable but gradually became accepted and normalized, the rights of nature idea seems wacky now but will eventually gain social currency. \u201cFor the rights of nature to be understood and become something we\u2019re comfortable with is going require a paradigm shift, just like the end of slavery did,\u201d he said.\nThat paradigm shift may entail nothing less than a total rejection of capitalism, according to Eduardo Gudynas, the executive secretary of the Latin American Center for Social Ecology in Uruguay. He argues that attempts to reduce environmental devastation while staying within a capitalism framework won\u2019t be enough to address the climate crisis.\n\u201cThe debate around the rights of nature is one of the most active frontlines in the fight for a non-market-based point of view,\u201d Gudynas told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a reaction against our society\u2019s commodification of everything.\u201d\nWill this legal strategy be effective?\nThe rights of nature movement has inspired new legislation around the world, but because it\u2019s still in its infancy, we don\u2019t yet have evidence about how much of a practical difference those laws will really make.\nEcuador, however, offers one example of concrete change. After the country enshrined the rights of nature in its constitution, locals have brought lawsuits against companies they say are causing serious environmental harm. In one recent case, people sued on behalf of a river that was being polluted in the course of a construction project. The court ruled in the river\u2019s favor.\nThat outcome is inspiring to people like O\u2019Dell in Toledo. And now that Lake Erie has joined the ranks of natural environments with legal rights, the activists in the rights of nature movement are buoyed at the prospect of what comes next.\n\u201cThere are many different effects we hope for,\u201d O\u2019Dell said. \u201cOne is education \u2014 that you open people\u2019s eyes to this possibility. Two is to give notice to those doing the environmental harm that we\u2019re not going to tolerate this anymore. Three is the hope that other people will follow you on the path you\u2019ve started to clear.\u201d\nTo Price, that last hope rises to the level of an existential need, given the pace of climate change. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the results of our narrow-mindedness, of our belief that nature is property and property ownership is the highest right,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hope is that by beginning somewhere, like Toledo, the conversation enlarges. You never know what\u2019s going to be the tipping point.\u201d\nSign up for the Future Perfect newsletter. Twice a week, you\u2019ll get a roundup of ideas and solutions for tackling our biggest challenges: improving public health, decreasing human and animal suffering, easing catastrophic risks, and \u2014 to put it simply \u2014 getting better at doing good.",
    "https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/9/21/17884512/maniac-netflix-review-emma-stone-jonah-hill-spoilers": "Maniac, a new, darkly comic Netflix miniseries starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, is the rare project that I like both more and less the longer I think about it.\nBy the time it reaches the midpoint of its 10 episodes, the series is one of the more confident and assured examples of what I call \u201cBig Moment TV,\u201d where every episode involves some jaw-dropping visual or conceit that\u2019s meant to send you to Twitter to buzz, \u201cDid you see that?!\u201d\nAnd as directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, the genius (and newly minted James Bond director) behind everything from the wonderful 2011 Jane Eyre to the visuals of the first season of True Detective, those moments really land. I wanted to go to Twitter to talk about them, except that would have been a violation of my screener agreement with Netflix.\nRating: 3 out of 5 vox-mark vox-mark vox-mark vox-mark vox-mark\nAnd yet there\u2019s something so calculated about Maniac. There\u2019s rarely the thrill of the unexpected, which is tough to explain in a series that longs, deeply, to provide the thrill of the unexpected. Every time the story would shift, or enter another genre entirely, or let the actors play other characters than the ones they came in as, I would nod and say, \u201cSure. Makes sense!\u201d Which is not what I think anybody involved was going for.\nSome of that stems from performance (Hill is a fine dramatic actor but maybe not the guy you want sublimating all of his live-wire energy to play a depressive), and some of it stems from the storytelling, which is a wackadoodle pastiche of \u201cmind-fuck cinema,\u201d in which the movies ask you to question reality and wonder what\u2019s going on and so on.\nBut not only have you seen the basic dramatic beats of Maniac over and over again, but Maniac takes great pains to explain to you, at every turn, what\u2019s going on, how the characters feel and think about it, and what those crazy, trippy visuals could mean. It\u2019s a mind-fuck movie so unconfident in its ability to fuck with you that it follows up every big reveal or jaw-dropping mindscape with a moment that seems to ask, \u201cDid you see what I did there?\u201d\nThis probably already sounds like a bunch of ideas thrown together in haste, which don\u2019t really cohere. It is, and it isn\u2019t, and to explain why, I\u2019m going to have to spoil the show almost in its entirety, so follow me after the massive spoiler warning to talk about why it\u2019s easy to remain interested in Maniac but hard to become truly invested in it.\nManiac is a show engineered to appease the short attention spans that led to Big Moment TV\nThe rise of Big Moment TV has been driven by two factors. The first is that TV storytelling has grown more complex in terms of serialization, but the second is that lots of people still kind of half pay attention to what they\u2019re watching, because they\u2019re doing chores or playing a game on their phone or whatever. So if you watch an episode of Game of Thrones and there\u2019s a big, bloody death or something, that jars you out of whatever other thing you\u2019re doing and forces you to pay attention.\nBut, increasingly, these sorts of shows feel driven less by the whims of their characters than by the whims of their creators. Game of Thrones went from a show that made you feel the weight of every death to a show that wantonly killed characters without much regard to emotional resonance or storytelling sense. And that\u2019s, ultimately, part of the fun of that show, but it took it from a must-watch to a fun show that often struggles to reach its potential.\nBut Big Moment TV has increasingly evolved to a point where it\u2019s less about a big death or a big plot twist and more about anything unusual that will get you talking on Twitter, as I explored in this article about The Magicians and Legion. And those two shows form useful comparison points for Maniac, with its occasionally fascinating, occasionally awkward attempts to fuse Big Moment TV, over-explanatory mind-fuck pastiche, and what amounts to falling asleep in front of Netflix. (It was an early adopter of Big Moment TV, lest we forget House of Cards\u2019 entire storytelling ethos.) All while the algorithm randomly shuffles through things it thinks you might like.\n(And really do turn away at this point if you want to remain unspoiled about this series, because knowing the premise of this show could potentially ruin it.)\nThe story focuses on Annie (Stone) and Owen (Hill), two 20-somethings struggling with barely repressed trauma and other mental conditions in a near-future New York where everything, including friendship, has become a part of the gig economy. You can even sell your likeness for various ads and stock photos, as Annie has done, which means that when Owen bumps into her at a purported pharma trial for a new drug, he both feels he already knows her and fears he\u2019s hallucinating her. (He was diagnosed with schizophrenia, see.)\nAnyway, the drug trial turns out to be a complicated procedure designed to put people through a sort of psychological boot camp, where in stage one they relive their greatest trauma (the loss of her sister for Annie; a suicide attempt \u2014 that might not have even happened \u2014 for Owen), attempt to better understand the roots of their psychological issues in stage two, and then confront those issues and their trauma in stage three, in hopes of healing and moving on.\nThe trial is overseen by a group of people cosplaying as the characters erasing Jim Carrey\u2019s memories in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, including Justin Theroux, the dryly funny Sonoya Mizuno, and (I swear I am not kidding about this) Sally Field playing a depressed computer.\nThe bulk of the series involves what happens when a mechanical malfunction results in the fusing of Owen and Annie\u2019s subconsciouses, which results in them essentially entering an anthology series. Across five of the season\u2019s 10 episodes, they play different characters, in different genres, following what amounts to Fukunaga\u2019s syllabus for a \u201chistory of American indie film\u201d class. There are suburban capers, and an extended (kinda awful) journey through a gangster/crime movie tale, and a story where Owen becomes a hawk. (That last one\u2019s a lot of fun!)\nThis is, I think, a pretty compelling way to explore two characters who seem paper-thin at first. By having Annie and Owen journey through both of their subconsciouses at once, the show could theoretically fill in details about these people\u2019s core beings while still allowing for plenty of action and adventure. Seeing Annie as a Long Island housewife trying to steal a lemur, or as a con artist interrupting a seance, or as a half-elven ranger in a generic fantasy kingdom gives us different sides of the actual Annie\u2019s persona and lets Stone have a lot of fun.\nBut I could never escape the feeling that the show\u2019s weirdness was less an organic investigation of two people in crisis and more a mechanism designed to keep me watching. The journeys that Annie and Owen take through their brains feel assembled more from other movies and TV shows than from genuine psychological exploration.\nOn a show limited only by the human imagination (at least in theory), these adventures stay frustratingly earthbound. They\u2019re \u201cimaginative,\u201d in the manner of a college student who\u2019s carefully cultivated her persona out of bits and pieces of other personas she\u2019s seen elsewhere, rather than authentic.\nWatching Maniac feels like watching Netflix\nIt feels a little churlish to complain about this, because watching Maniac is a lot of fun. I sat down intending to watch a couple of episodes one day and ended up watching seven, because I really did want to see what would happen next. The writing staff \u2014 led by Patrick Somerville of The Leftovers fame \u2014 has given real thought to the story of all 10 episodes as well as the story of each episode, which leads to fun journeys through the various genre pastiches the writers come up with. (I loved the Long Island-set crime caper, which felt straight out of a Coen brothers movie.)\nBut I could never get past the stage where I was enjoying the show\u2019s considerably gorgeous surfaces to access some deeper level. And then after watching the finale, I read a quote from Fukunaga in a recent GQ profile of him, and something clicked. He said:\nBecause Netflix is a data company, they know exactly how their viewers watch things. So they can look at something you\u2019re writing and say, We know based on our data that if you do this, we will lose this many viewers. So it\u2019s a different kind of note-giving. It\u2019s not like, Let\u2019s discuss this and maybe I\u2019m gonna win. The algorithm\u2019s argument is gonna win at the end of the day. So the question is do we want to make a creative decision at the risk of losing people. ... There was one episode we wrote that was just layer upon layer peeled back, and then reversed again. Which was a lot of fun to write and think of executing, but, like, halfway through the season, we\u2019re just losing a bunch of people on that kind of binging momentum. That\u2019s probably not a good move, you know? So it\u2019s a decision that was made 100 percent based on audience participation.\nNow, listen, the notes-giving process in Hollywood is important. I\u2019m not somebody who rails against notes, or thinks they ruin the creative process or tear down impeccable works of art. But something about letting a computer give those notes speaks to why Maniac, ultimately, felt less human than human to me, why it always seemed like it was assembled more than it was a deeply felt passion project for anyone. And, indeed, the series is based on a Norwegian show of the same name, and the various genre pastiches look a lot like other Netflix shows if you squint, and every single actor feels specifically chosen to appeal to a very specific demographic.\nThis would almost feel like Netflix snarkily commenting on itself if the show didn\u2019t take itself so seriously. The fact that it turns into a genuinely sincere story of how Owen and Annie come together to better each other\u2019s lives in the last few episodes is either the bold swing that saves the enterprise or a case of too little, too late. I\u2019m more in the former camp than the latter, but it\u2019s not hard for me to imagine talking myself out of that stance.\nAnd yet there\u2019s something kind of beautiful about a series that applies the dull plotting of most other TV shows \u2014 all life-and-death stakes and, \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta get to the [plot device] before they do!\u201d numbness \u2014 to two emotionally damaged people trying to heal. There\u2019s a bravado here that I can\u2019t write off, even if I never felt like the show went deep enough to turn either Owen or Annie into anything more than ciphers, despite all of the self-analyzing monologues both deliver in an attempt to sell their complexities.\nWhatever complaints I have about the show, then, might be a part of its commentary on a world where our mental horizons are so often occupied by stories we\u2019ve heard elsewhere. If you and I somehow had our subconsciousnesses fused, and then went through a series of adventures in dreamspace together, wouldn\u2019t it be more likely that those adventures would be drawn from the movies and TV shows we had watched than something wildly original?\nManiac isn\u2019t weird enough to really achieve what it wants to, but it does say something \u2014 however accidentally \u2014 about how reality is already weird enough. Maybe that\u2019s why we\u2019re so content to live inside the dreams of others.\nManiac is streaming on Netflix.",
    "https://www.vox.com/polyarchy/2019/3/21/18275785/electoral-college-ranked-choice-voting-president-democracy": "This post is part of Polyarchy , an independent blog produced by the political reform program at New America , a Washington think tank devoted to developing new ideas and new voices.\nI\u2019m glad we\u2019re once again debating the antiquated Electoral College, inspired by Elizabeth Warren\u2019s recent call to abolish the vintage 1787 Rube Goldberg-style invention for picking a president at a time when popular democracy was highly suspect and slave states were fearful of losing their power based on population alone.\nAbolishing the Electoral College is a modern-democratic-principles slam dunk: Every vote should count the same, no matter where you live. Absent a baroque defense of hyper-federalization or a nakedly partisan argument dressed in the breeches and waistcoat of blind traditionalism, there is no good case for the Electoral College. Rather, the more interesting question is what to replace it with.\nThere\u2019s a very good reason no other democracy has ever copied our cockamamie system: It makes zero sense\nThe most popular replacement proposal is a direct popular vote: Whoever gets the most votes nationwide wins. Certainly, this is an improvement over the Electoral College. But it still employs the worst form of voting \u2014 simple plurality. I say worst form because simple plurality means a candidate does not have to win a majority of votes to win the election, and leaves open the possibility that the least-preferred candidate wins because two other candidates split the remaining vote. Or, as more commonly happens, plurality elections marginalize third parties as spoilers, and campaigns become simply lesser-of-two-evils contests.\nThe two-round system, which most presidential democracies use, is an obvious improvement over the single-round plurality system. In the second round, the winning candidate mathematically has to appeal to a majority. This generally produces more moderate winners than simple plurality elections, which generate more extreme winners and more divisive politics. Eric Holder, among others, has proposed the two-round system.\nFrance as a case study in the two-round presidential election\nTo understand how a two-round system might work, consider the 2017 French presidential election, which can illustrate both the benefits and the dangers of a two-round system. In the first-round election, centrist Emmanuel Macron got 24 percent of the vote and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen got 21 percent, narrowly coming in second.\nIn the second round, Macron won handily, defeating Le Pen 66 percent to 33 percent. In a head-to-head contest, unclouded by long-standing partisan affiliations, the French people solidly rejected the far-right populist, and France wound up with the candidate that most citizens could ultimately agree on.\nThe adage in France goes like this: On the first ballot, the voters select. On the second ballot, they elect. Or, put another way, on the first ballot voters choose; on the second they eliminate.\nThe 2017 French election shows a benefit of the two-round system: It created space for a shake-up of the existing ossified party structure. France\u2019s two long-standing major political parties, the center-left Socialists and the center-right Republicans, had lost considerable support. In the two-round system, it was possible for a party to emerge without being dismissed as a spoiler.\nBut things could have easily gone differently. The fourth-place finisher was Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, a far-left populist, who won just short of 20 percent of the vote. But M\u00e9lenchon might have done a little better, Macron a little worse, and the French people might have been left to choose between a far-left populist and a far-right populist.\nA two-round system encourages more candidates but then requires a high level of strategic voting for voters, who might have complicated preferences about who they think can win, versus who they\u2019d most like to win.\nMoreover, Macron may have won with 66 percent of the general election vote, but the large margin was not so much a reflection of his broad-based popularity as it was Le Pen\u2019s unpopularity. On his own, his popularity has fallen after he tried to claim a broader mandate than his support deserved.\nWhy ranked-choice voting is superior to the two-round system\nA better alternative would be ranked-choice voting for president. As the name suggests, ranked-choice voting lets voters rank their choices. Voters mark their first choice candidate first, their second choice candidate second, then their third-choice candidate third, and so on. Easy as 1-2-3. Think of it as a political listicle: Candidates in this election, ranked.\nThe votes are then tallied as follows: If one candidate has an outright majority of first-place votes, that candidate wins. But if no candidate has a majority in the first round, second-choice preferences come into play. The candidate with the fewest number of first-choice votes is eliminated, and voters who had ranked that candidate first have their votes transferred to the candidate they ranked second. This continues until a single candidate gathers a majority, with subsequent preferences transferring as candidates get eliminated from the bottom up.\nRanked-choice voting improves on the two-round runoff elections in the following ways. First, it is more likely to produce a broadly acceptable winner. Ranked-choice voting rewards candidates who can appeal most broadly, because candidates compete to be voters\u2019 second and third choices as well as their first. By contrast, in a two-round system, it\u2019s quite possible for the two candidates with the most dedicated but not necessarily broadest support to advance to the final round, recreating the lesser-of-two-evils problem.\nSecond, a two-round system demands complex strategic calculations for voters, who face a trade-off between who they want to win and who they think can make it to the second round. This can lead to very different outcomes based on small variations in polling. California\u2019s top-two primary displayed this problem last year, when Democratic voters struggled to coordinate around the candidate most likely to advance to the second round and avoid splitting a crowded field and allowing two Republicans to advance to the general election.\nThe complexities of these strategic calculations can also invite political operatives to support \u201closer\u201d or \u201cdummy\u201d candidates designed to fracture the field, confuse voters, and pull away crucial support from frontrunners in crowded fields (as also happened in California). The ranked-choice voting renders this strategy pointless. There are no spoilers in ranked-choice voting.\nThird, the two-round election can also lead to unintended vote-splitting among candidates competing for similar voters, denying voters the ability to find agreement through ranking. In ranked-choice voting, voters can vote sincerely. They don\u2019t need to worry if they are wasting their votes. And nobody has an incentive to run loser candidates.\nFourth, an instant runoff is both less costly for governments (one election costs less than two) and for voters (one visit to the polls takes less time than two). Voter turnout often declines in a second round, either because voters\u2019 preferred candidate didn\u2019t advance or because voters simply lose interest. The voters most likely to drop off in the second round are the least educated.\nAdditionally, if we\u2019re going to incorporate ranked-choice voting into how we select presidents, we should also use it for the primaries.\nAll else equal, a popular vote is better than the Electoral College (for obvious reasons). And a two-round popular vote is better than a single-round plurality popular vote, because by requiring the winner to earn a true majority, it avoids the problem of extreme minority candidates.\nBut ranked-choice voting is superior to the two-round system because it simultaneously maximizes voter participation and broad-based coalition-building. It also allows voters to vote sincerely and is most likely to avoid perverse outcomes.\nWe know more today about elections than we did in 1787. Our institutions should reflect that.\nThe Framers were political scientists with no existing model for electing a president and tremendous ambivalence over what they wanted out of an executive. They were practical politicians trying to work out an acceptable compromise.\nWe can forgive them for coming up with a sub-optimal approach given the urgency and limited time and political constraints. But with 230 years of experience in modern democracy, we now have plenty of data on what works best.\nNo electoral system is perfect. But some are demonstrably better than others. Rather than limit ourselves to an antiquated and inferior tradition, we should strive for the best possible. National popular ranked-choice voting is the best possible way of electing a president.",
    "https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/3/19/18271276/alan-krueger-economist-death-minimum-wage-princeton": "Princeton economist Alan Krueger died by suicide this past weekend at age 58, the university announced on Monday.\nCasual political observers probably know Krueger best for his four years of service in the Obama administration, first as assistant secretary of the Treasury for economic policy and then as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers \u2014 effectively the White House\u2019s top economist.\nBut to those in his field, Krueger was known for bringing a new level of rigor to economics research and puncturing a number of long-held pieties. His work with Berkeley\u2019s David Card suggested that simplistic econ 101 predictions that minimum wage increases necessarily cause job losses don\u2019t always hold true. His work on education with co-authors like MIT\u2019s Joshua Angrist and Mathematica\u2019s Stacy Dale brought new attention to the ways in which simplistic statistical analyses can lead to wrong conclusions, and popularized new methods for doing that analysis better.\nAnd his work and speeches in the Obama White House helped make economic inequality a mainstream issue of debate in the early 2010s, influencing American political life for years to come.\nHere are four big things that Krueger taught the world.\nMinimum wages don\u2019t always cause job loss\nIn introductory economics courses, students are typically taught that setting price floors \u2014 on milk, oil, or, perhaps most importantly, labor \u2014 causes supply to exceed demand.\nIn the case of labor, what that means is that if there\u2019s a minimum wage, employers\u2019 demand for workers falls (because they cost more), and the supply of workers increases (because they\u2019re promised more money), meaning there\u2019s unemployment, with all the costs and suffering that entails.\nThis conclusion was largely based on abstract theory, but it held sway for decades. This chart, from economist Lars Christensen, lays out this econ 101-type analysis as it applies to the minimum wage:\nSetting a minimum wage increases wages (Wmin > Weq), sure, but it also increases the supply of labor (N1 > Neq) while decreasing demand (N2 < Neq), and leading to a bunch of unemployment (N1 - N2).\nAs a consequence, for years many economists assumed, almost without questioning, that minimum wages destroyed jobs. They might be worthwhile, sure, but you have to weigh the harm they do to the demand for labor against their benefits for workers who remain employed.\nIn a paper first published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 1993, Krueger and his co-author Card exploded that conventional wisdom. They sought to evaluate the effects of an increase in New Jersey\u2019s minimum wage, from $4.25 to $5.05 an hour, that took effect on April 1, 1992. (At 2019 prices, that\u2019s equivalent to a hike from $7.70 to $9.15.)\nCard and Krueger surveyed more than 400 fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania to see if employment growth was slower in New Jersey following the minimum wage increase. They found no evidence that it was. \u201cDespite the increase in wages, full-time-equivalent employment increased in New Jersey relative to Pennsylvania,\u201d they concluded. That increase wasn\u2019t statistically significant, but they certainly found no reason to think that the minimum wage was hurting job growth in New Jersey relative to Pennsylvania.\nCard and Krueger\u2019s was not the first paper to estimate the empirical effects of the minimum wage. But its compelling methodology, and the fact that it came from two highly respected professors at Princeton, forced orthodox economists to take the conclusion seriously. New York Times reporter Binyamin Appelbaum lays out some of the vitriolic reaction to the paper in a Twitter thread:\nThe Nobel laureate James Buchanan wrote in the Wall Street Journal that Card and Krueger were undermining the credibility of economics as a discipline. He called them and their allies \"a bevy of camp-following whores.\" \u2014 Binyamin Appelbaum (@BCAppelbaum) March 18, 2019\nCard and Krueger expanded their results into a well-regarded book, Myth and Measurement, and then largely left the debate. \u201cI\u2019ve subsequently stayed away from the minimum wage literature for a number of reasons,\u201d Card said in an interview years later. \u201cFirst, it cost me a lot of friends. People that I had known for many years, for instance, some of the ones I met at my first job at the University of Chicago, became very angry or disappointed. They thought that in publishing our work we were being traitors to the cause of economics as a whole.\u201d\nBut the effects of their research have remained. Both critics and supporters of minimum wage increases have gotten a lot less theoretical and a lot more empirical. Some empirical economists (most notably UC Irvine\u2019s David Neumark) still think minimum wages cause job loss; others (most notably UMass Amherst\u2019s Arindrajit Dube) argue that the employment effects of most hikes in the wage are minimal, and swamped by the reduction in poverty that the increased wage itself generates. But all agree that this is an empirical question best answered through careful consideration of what actually happens.\nThe most recent meta-analysis I\u2019ve seen, reviewing studies published since 2000 (many of which wouldn\u2019t have been written without Card and Krueger), concludes that the effect of most minimum wage increases on employment is small and potentially nonexistent, and that research in the wake of Card and Krueger has substantially lowered the average estimate of minimum wages\u2019 effect on jobs.\nThere are better ways to figure out what causes what\nAlan Krueger \u2014 along with Card and many other prominent microeconomists of their generation \u2014 was part of what their colleagues Joshua Angrist and J\u00f6rn-Steffen Pischke have termed the \u201ccredibility revolution\u201d in economics.\nThey quote in a 2010 paper their older colleague Edward Leamer as stating in 1983, \u201cHardly anyone takes data analysis seriously. Or perhaps more accurately, hardly anyone takes anyone else\u2019s data analysis seriously.\u201d Data analysis was so subjective, so easily pliable to one\u2019s own pre-chosen conclusions, as to feel almost useless.\nThen a new generation of economists took it upon themselves to change that status quo, by carefully adopting better research designs better able to determine causation (not just correlation), and focusing heavily on actual experiments and quasi-experiments where it\u2019s clearer what factor is causing what.\n\u201cInstrumental variables\u201d were one of the more popular tools for sorting out causation to emerge from the credibility revolution, and one of their early test uses was in a paper by Krueger and Angrist on the effects of compulsory schooling (laws requiring people to be in K-12 education until they\u2019re 16 or 17) in the United States, and thus, indirectly on the effects of going to school for longer.\nThe simplest way to see if compulsory schooling increases adult earnings would be to compare if people earned more before or after compulsory schooling took effect in the United States. But there are lots of other factors besides compulsory schooling that affect school attendance and earnings over those periods. Maybe the economy went into recession, or funding for schools also went up, or a lot more schools opened.\nAll those factors would affect earnings and school attendance, and could muddle an analysis trying to sort out what compulsory schooling, specifically, does for students. These other factors are called \u201comitted variables\u201d and can really distort this kind of analysis. You can control for some of them directly, but usually there are omitted variables that you can\u2019t measure or don\u2019t even think of that still matter.\nOne way around this is to find an \u201cinstrumental variable\u201d: a variable that predicts the things whose effects you want to know (compulsory schooling) but that should not separately affect the ultimate effects you\u2019re measuring (earnings).\nAngrist and Krueger used as an instrumental variable the time of year students are born. Whether you\u2019re born in March or November shouldn\u2019t, on its own, affect how much money you make or how many years of school you get. But because compulsory schooling laws typically mandate learning up to a certain age (like 16), they typically result in students with birthdates later in the school year getting more education once they drop out than students with birthdates earlier in the school year.\nSo birthdates allowed Angrist and Krueger to estimate the effects of compulsory schooling (or just going to school longer) without worrying as much about omitted variables. Unless there\u2019s some other way that being born in the first quarter of the school year should lower the earnings of high school dropouts, beyond them being less educated, this method should give a sound estimate of the effects of compulsory schooling itself, and on the effects of having more months of school on earnings.\nTheir conclusion was that school really did boost earnings for students forced to stay in school longer. Their work has been critiqued since, and instrumental variables estimates can mislead if the instrumental variable chosen is badly selected, but the influence of this methodology is hard to overstate.\nThe Angrist-Krueger quarter-of-birth paper stirred a conversation across the discipline about instrumental variables and identification that now underpins modern applied economics\nIt is hard to overstate its influence \u2014 Prof Dynarski (@dynarski) March 18, 2019\nSelective colleges help minority students, but not white students\nKrueger\u2019s work, even when theoretically groundbreaking, tended to be incredibly practical. One great example, especially in light of the recent scandal over bribery in elite college admissions, is his work with Stacy Dale at Mathematica on whether selective colleges actually increase earnings: Does going to Harvard really cause you to earn more than going to UMass Boston?\nHere, again, using proper methods is important. Krueger and Dale found that if you controlled for standard variables like GPAs, SAT scores, and so on, students who went to selective colleges earned substantially more. That might mislead a casual observer into thinking that the selective colleges caused them to earn more, even more than their natural smarts and work ethic would\u2019ve earned them.\nBut Krueger and Dale, in two papers released in NBER in 1999 and 2011, found that selective college attendance actually has no effect if you compare students who were admitted to selective colleges and attended to ones who were admitted and did not attend. These two groups are not identical; presumably there is something different about students who, say, were admitted to Harvard but chose to go to UMass Boston compared to students who were admitted to Harvard and chose to attend. But they\u2019re much more similar groups than Harvard students and UMass Boston students in general. That makes comparing them a better, if still imperfect, way of estimating what going to Harvard does to earnings.\nIn their second paper, Dale and Krueger used a better data set and looked at longer time horizons, and found some interesting nuances. \u201cOur results suggest that students from disadvantaged family backgrounds (in terms of educational attainment) experience a higher return to attending a selective college than those from more advantaged family backgrounds,\u201d they concluded. Black and Hispanic students also tend to benefit economically from going to selective schools. But white kids whose parents went to college and/or grad school don\u2019t benefit much, economically.\nThat\u2019s a good reason for rich white parents like Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin to stop bribing elite colleges to get their kids in; their kids will be fine in material terms regardless. But it\u2019s also a good reason for elite schools to admit a lot more poor, black, and Latino kids, who are likelier to benefit than rich white kids.\nEquality and equality of opportunity are intimately connected\nAs CEA chair for Obama in early 2012, in the wake of Occupy protests and Obama\u2019s \u201cBuffett Rule\u201d proposal to fight inequality, Krueger coined a term that helped solidify the idea that income inequality is a serious harm: the Great Gatsby curve:\nThe curve shows the relationship between income inequality (measured using the Gini coefficient, a standard metric) versus inequality of opportunity (measured by the correlation between a parent\u2019s earnings and their child\u2019s \u2014 the idea being that in a world with equal opportunity, the correlation would be small). And it shows that these two measures usually give very similar answers. That suggests that rising income inequality in the US is likely to be accompanied by a decline in equality of opportunity.\n\u201cThe persistence in the advantages and disadvantages of income passed from parents to the children is predicted to rise by about a quarter for the next generation as a result of the rise in inequality that the U.S. has seen in the last 25 years,\u201d Krueger concluded in his speech. \u201cIt is hard to look at these figures and not be concerned that rising inequality is jeopardizing our tradition of equality of opportunity.\u201d\nThe idea of a connection was not novel to Krueger; Miles Corak, an economist at CUNY, did the research that Krueger based his chart on, and tells some of the backstory here. And naturally, the idea of a correlation has been fiercely contested by conservatives (with others like Corak firing back).\nBut Krueger popularized the relationship and helped make income inequality a more mainstream concern among lawmakers by suggesting that it could be a proxy for the erosion of a value every politician in Washington claims to hold dear: equality of opportunity.\nSign up for the Future Perfect newsletter.

    "https://www.vox.com/2018/5/31/17408862/pusha-t-drake-duppy-diss-beef-explained": "Drake\u2019s new double album, Scorpion, is out, and one of its recurring themes is fatherhood \u2014 specifically, Drake reportedly fathering the son of a French actress. \u201cThat shit is in stone, sealed and signed,\u201d he raps in the song \u201cMarch 14.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not my lover like Billie Jean, but the kid is mine.\u201d Elsewhere on the album he works out his contentious feelings toward the child\u2019s mother, his overwhelmed reaction to learning he was a dad, and his resentment at the publicity around the event.\nThe news that Drake is owning his parental status is big \u2014 so big it\u2019s overshadowed nearly everything else about the sprawling album, including what is apparently new vocals from the late Michael Jackson. But there\u2019s a lot more to Drake\u2019s rhymes on this subject than his own personal reflections on what it means to be a dad. It might be a stretch to say that the 2018 album Scorpion only spends as much time on fatherhood as it does because Lil Wayne wore Bape once \u2014 but then again, it might not.\nSuch is the delightfully labyrinthine rap feud behind the story of Scorpion \u2014 which starts with \u201cThe Story of Adidon,\u201d the mystifying killer diss track of Drake that Pusha T released in May.\nLike many rap artists, Drake is no stranger to beef. But the latest involving Pusha T and \u201cThe Story of Adidon\u201d has left some fans and onlookers scratching their heads. Why was Drake in blackface? Where did Pusha get that photo? Does Drake really have a secret love child? And what\u2019s all this about invoices and fashion wars, again?\nPusha T dropped \u201cThe Story of Adidon\u201d on YouTube without a lot of fanfare, but it immediately caused a sensation, garnering 2.5 million views in less than a day. And no wonder \u2014 was that Drake in blackface on the cover? (Yes. Yes it was.)\nPusha\u2019s track was a full-on Drake diss, containing lyrics like, \u201cLet\u2019s have a heart-to-heart about your pride / Even though you\u2019re multi, I see that your soul don\u2019t look alive.\u201d The song mocks Drake\u2019s dad, skewers Drake\u2019s attitude toward blackness, and accuses Drake of being a deadbeat dad to Adonis, the son he\u2019s rumored to have fathered with a French woman named Sophie Brussaux, a former porn actress, in October 2017. Drake seems to have publicly acknowledged the relationship at last in multiple tracks from his new album Scorpion, in which he raps that \u201cthe kid is mine,\u201d apparently in response to the uproar.\nIf Pusha going all in on Drake\u2019s approach to fatherhood seems a little harsh, hold up. In fact, the feud between Drake and Pusha may be all about an entirely different set of rappers \u2014 but we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. For now, let\u2019s break down the many things happening in \u201cAdidon,\u201d and what led to Pusha turning in one of the most glorious installments in rap feuds since the halcyon days of 50 Cent.\n\u201cAdidon\u201d tackles complex, intermingled themes of fatherhood and blackness\nPusha T\u2019s thesis for \u201cThe Story of Adidon\u201d is basically twofold: Drake\u2019s confusion about his biracial identity has led him to adopt a hypocritical attitude toward fatherhood. The result, so sayeth Pusha, is that Drake is simultaneously abandoning his son while clinging to his own father for a sense of authentic blackness, even as he enjoys the privileges of wealth and his ability to \u201cpass\u201d as a white man.\nPusha achieves this complex layering by structuring \u201cStory of Adidon\u201d after Jay-Z\u2019s 2017 track \u201cStory of O.J.\u201d Pusha raps over the \u201cStory of O.J.\u201d backing track, and both songs explore the intersection of class, wealth, and black identity in America.\nQuoting O.J.\u2019s famous apocryphal claim \u201cI\u2019m not black, I\u2019m O.J.,\u201d Jay-Z fills his video with cartoon racist stereotypes. The song serves as a wry critique on gentrification and modern attempts to use wealth to overcome one\u2019s perceived blackness.\nThe song also samples Nina Simone\u2019s famous song \u201cFour Women,\u201d which explores the generational impact of slavery and skin-tone prejudice in America. Each woman is without a surname, left to speculate about who her father could have been based on the color of her skin. This basic theme \u2014 of being connected and/or disconnected from black identity through paternity \u2014 plays out directly in \u201cStory of Adidon.\u201d\nThe name \u201cAdidon\u201d refers to Drake\u2019s long-rumored upcoming partnership with Adidas. Pusha T\u2019s track fuels rumors that Drake had intended to name his forthcoming sneaker line \u201cAdidon,\u201d a hybrid of Adidas and Adonis, after Brussaux\u2019s 7-month-old son.\nPusha thinks that\u2019s a bit hypocritical of Drake, for a few reasons. For starters, he says Drake is a \u201cdeadbeat mothafucka, playin\u2019 border patrol\u201d when it comes to his alleged son. \u201cAdonis is your son / and he deserves more than an Adidas press run, that\u2019s real,\u201d he admonishes.\nAt the time of Pusha\u2019s diss, Drake had yet to publicly acknowledge any connection between himself and Adonis. If he had been planning to do it with a line of shoes, it would have been an odd start to fatherhood; but in Scorpion, Drake instead defends his actions in what is apparently a direct response to Pusha.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t hiding my kid from the world,\u201d he protests, \u201cI was hiding the world from my kid\u201d \u2014 specifically from \u201cempty souls\u201d like Pusha who just want to \u201cdebate\u201d him:\nFrom empty souls who just wake up and look to debate Until you staring at your seed, you can never relate\nPusha argues on the track that it would also be in keeping with Drake\u2019s history with his own father. See, Drake\u2019s father, Dennis Graham, abandoned Drake and his mother in Toronto when Drake was 5 years old. Drake spent much of his rap career publicly working out his well-known issues toward his father in song. In recent years, however, the two seem to have fully reconciled. Drake frequently appears in his dad\u2019s celebrity Instagram and put Graham\u2019s picture on the cover of his 2017 song cycle More Life. Graham, for his part, recently got a giant tattoo of his son\u2019s face.\nAll good stuff, right?\nNot to Pusha. In \u201cAdidon,\u201d he claims that Drake is basically using his dad to bolster his own black identity. Drake \u2014 whose mom is Jewish and whose father, Graham, is a black Catholic \u2014 has spoken often about his biracial identity, sometimes as a positive and sometimes as a negative, and sometimes both. In a 2011 interview with the Village Voice, the Canadian appeared baffled by Americans\u2019 perpetual emphasis on skin tone and lightness, noting that American fans frequently viewed him as white, not black.\nPusha\u2019s argument is that Drake doesn\u2019t have any authentic connection to black identity and so has to \u201cparade\u201d his father, described in the song as a Steve Harvey look-alike who embodies a cultural stereotype of cartoonish blackness.\nAnd speaking of caricatures of blackness ...\nWTF is up with that blackface photo?\nPlease stop referring to this picture as \u201cartwork\u201d...I\u2019m not an internet baby, I don\u2019t edit images...this is a REAL picture...these are his truths, see for yourself https://t.co/gd6vRS3HM8 pic.twitter.com/2el58HEZ8F \u2014 King Push (@PUSHA_T) May 30, 2018\nIn the tweet above, Pusha is referring to the startling cover image he included with his video, which is one of a pair of portraits that celebrity photographer David Leyes made of Drake. Drake apparently had the idea to style himself in blackface wearing a Jim Crow T-shirt, according to Leyes in Instagram comments as the diss track was going viral.\nLeyes at first was positive, stating that he\u2019d \u201ccaptured Drake\u2019s idea\u201d and that he was \u201cproud to be part of a strong statement made by a black man about the fucked up culture he is living in.\u201d That pride didn\u2019t last long, however; soon he tweeted at Pusha\u2019s manager asking him to have the photo removed from Pusha\u2019s Twitter. Later, he apparently initiated a Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown of Pusha\u2019s album cover on Instagram. The portraits still remain public on archived versions of Leyes\u2019s website, however, and were captioned \u201cDrake Us & Them.\u201d\nOn Thursday, May 31, Drake responded in a note published in an Instagram story. In the note, he clarified that the photo was 11 years old and produced in the context of him being an actor (he was a regular on Degrassi: The Next Generation at the time) frustrated by the limited and heavily stereotypical roles available to black actors in the industry.\nDrake speaks on \u201cblackface\u201d photos circulating. pic.twitter.com/y3SrOl9DcQ \u2014 Word On Road (@WordOnRd) May 31, 2018\nAt the time of the photo, 2007, Drake was involved in producing a bizarre short film that was also titled Us & Them.\nThe Jim Crow T-shirt Drake wears in the photo is part of a subversive clothing line called Jim Crow Couture, created by the Toronto label Too Black Guys. In response to the uproar, Too Black Guys released a statement to Slate supporting Drake\u2019s use of the imagery.\n\u201cToo Black Guys has a history of representing the black experience in an unapologetic way,\u201d the statement read. \u201cAlthough this was not an image from any of our photoshoots, we feel that Drake, who is a long-time friend of the brand, was brilliantly illustrating the hypocrisy of the Jim Crow era. The subtleties of Drake, a young black man, mimicking how white men used to mimic and dehumanize black people may be lost in a rap battle but we should not be distracted from the issues that are still affecting our communities.\u201d\nPusha, however, seems to be reading Drake\u2019s minstrel performance as unironic internalized racism \u2014 as a straightforward example of a light-skinned man who\u2019s engaging racist caricatures of blackness in order to feel authentic, even as he\u2019s able to enjoy the privileges of appealing to white culture.\nHis statement in response to Drake\u2019s explanation of the photo seems to support this. In an interview Thursday morning on the Los Angeles radio station Real 92.3, Pusha said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it at all. You are silent on all black issues, Drake, with a huge platform.\u201d\nYes, this is all complicated. But that doesn\u2019t even touch the thorny backstory that led us here: a story of ancient beefs, culture clashing, competing production companies, and \u2014 oh, yes \u2014 invoices.\nHere\u2019s what led to \u201cAdidon\u201d\nPusha\u2019s \u201cAdidon\u201d is a response to Drake\u2019s recent, relatively sweet-tempered diss \u201cDuppy Freestyle,\u201d which is itself a response to the recent Pusha track \u201cInfrared,\u201d which is a response to the 2017 Drake track \u201cTwo Birds, One Stone,\u201d which is a response to 2016\u2019s \u201cHGTV\u201d from Pusha, which is a response to Drake\u2019s 2013 \u201cTuscan Leather,\u201d which is a response to Pusha\u2019s 2012 track \u201cExodus 23:1,\u201d which extends a feud that dates back to the mid-aughts.\nGot all that?\nOkay, let\u2019s back up a few years. Pusha T and his brother Malice (later known as No Malice) formed the rap duo Clipse in 1992 when they were still teens living in Virginia Beach. Though they were breakout successes, they ran into trouble in the mid-2000s due to issues with their record label, Jive. Eventually the two each went solo, and Pusha signed with GOOD Music, a notable record label founded by Kanye West in 2004 and boasting a litany of famed artists from Common to Big Sean to Kid Cudi.\nAt odds with the GOOD crew is the crew collectively known as YMCMB \u2014 that is, all the rappers and artists signed to, or affiliated with, Lil Wayne\u2019s label Young Money Entertainment and the label Cash Money Records, co-founded by Birdman (a.k.a. Baby) and his brother Slim Williams.\nAs early as 2006, Pusha took issue with members of the YMCMB crew. Initially, as chronicled in the 2006 Clipse track \u201cMr. Me Too,\u201d he directed his irritation solely at Lil Wayne. But this ire also swirled amid a culture of nearly constant back-and-forth taunting between various members of YMCMB and GOOD, most notably between Lil Wayne/Drake and Kanye/Jay-Z (who isn\u2019t on GOOD but is loosely affiliated through his work with Kanye).\nPart of this animosity seems to have stemmed from general ribbing and one-upmanship \u2014 it\u2019s worth noting that most of these artists have collaborated repeatedly over the years \u2014 and occasionally from disagreements over style similarities and perceived theft of lyrics and musical elements.\nPusha did his part to pitch in, taking an apparent swipe at Lil Wayne and his father-son relationship with Birdman in his verse on 2008\u2019s \u201cRe-Up Intro.\u201d Then he came out hard against Drake, starting with his 2011 freestyle \u201cDon\u2019t Fuck With Me,\u201d which he rapped over Drake\u2019s \u201cDreams Money Can Buy.\u201d\nPusha\u2019s attitude toward Drake in this early offering is one that stays consistent throughout his work: namely, Drake is a lyrics stealer, a shameless opportunist, and kind of a pussy.\nMoreover, he crucially opens this song with what would prove to be a proverb: \u201cRe-up gang, G.O.O.D. Music, Def Jam / I love my family.\u201d Pusha clearly sees the YMCMB crew as disloyal, a theme he\u2019d go in hard on in the 2012 track \u201cExodus 23:1.\u201d In this track, he launches a full-scale onslaught at the YMCMB crew, whom he describes as prone to cribbing other rappers\u2019 musical styles and production elements. He portrays Drake as being a weak character surrounded by disloyal sycophants, and Drake and Lil Wayne as fake thugs reliant on Birdman\u2019s talent and influence.\nIn response to this track, Lil Wayne famously responded, \u201cFuck \u2019em\u201d:\nFuk pusha t and anybody that love em \u2014 Lil Wayne WEEZY F (@LilTunechi) May 24, 2012\nIn the years since, the beef between Pusha and Drake has generally gone like this: Pusha claims Drake steals his best stuff from other artists while he searches for authentic identity; Drake implies Pusha exaggerates the seriousness and extent of his life experience as a drug dealer in order to seem more street than he actually is.\nIt did, however, get an especially fun twist with \u201cDuppy Freestyle.\u201d In the song, Drake jokes that Pusha owes him money for the extra attention his diss track will bring Pusha\u2019s new album, noting, \u201cTell Ye, \u2018We got a invoice comin\u2019 to you\u2019 / considerin\u2019 that we just sold another 20 for you.\u201d\nPusha clapped back on Twitter, \u201cSend the invoice for the extra 20 ...\u201d and that\u2019s exactly what Drizzy did, via Instagram, the same day \u201cDuppy\u201d dropped. The invoice requests $100,000 for \u201cpromotional assistance and career reviving.\u201d\nYou\u2019re welcome. A post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on May 25, 2018 at 6:08pm PDT\nAnd of course, Pusha T\u2019s response with \u201cStory of Adidon\u201d has vaulted the feud into the stuff of legend \u2014 which itself helped lead to Scorpion.\nHow did we come this far? Is all this really just about record label rivalry?\nKinda yes, and kinda no.\nHere\u2019s what really led up to \u201cAdidon.\u201d (Hint: it\u2019s about money, contracts, and who wore Bape first.)\nSo why did Pusha T hate Lil Wayne and fam so much? Apparently, two reasons.\nAround the time of 2006\u2019s \u201cMr. Me Too,\u201d he was annoyed at Lil Wayne for stealing the street fashion style, including specific labels like Bape, expressed by Clipse and their pal Pharrell. You may not think that sounds significant, but you\u2019d be wrong. Lil Wayne famously wore Bape in his 2006 video \u201cHustler Musik,\u201d and posed in Bape for the cover of Vibe:\nI really cant believe this @Drake vs @PUSHA_T beef started with Lil Wayne and Pusha battling over who wore Bape first.\nThis Hip Hop beef is rather stupid. pic.twitter.com/myAxLtqNTy \u2014 Renzel (@FoluShaw) May 26, 2018\nWhile this feud was happening, Lil Wayne went off in an interview with Complex about the perception that he was somehow stealing Clipse and Pharrell\u2019s street style. \u201cI don\u2019t see no fuckin\u2019 Clipse,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on man. ... This is a fucking legend you\u2019re talking to right here. ... Who the fuck is Pharrell?\u201d\n(Well, it was 2006.)\nIn response, Pusha bit back hard in a 2007 interview, including roping in homophobic rumors about Lil Wayne\u2019s relationship with Birdman (the pair famously kissed a couple of times) to imply that Lil Wayne wasn\u2019t a real legend:\n\u201cYou can\u2019t kiss other men, you can\u2019t wobble dee-wobble dee, and and you can\u2019t bite styles,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t bite everybody\u2019s styles. You can\u2019t try to rap like Jay-Z, dress like the Clipse, become a coke dealer after 5 albums, and now dress like Jim Jones. You can\u2019t do all that and be a legend. You have to be a trendsetter and he ain\u2019t setting any trends.\u201d\nSo part of this is about clothes, and part of it seems to be about the kind of hustle you have to bring to be a real (straight) rapper, and who\u2019s bringing it better.\nBut the other reason, according to Hot 97\u2019s Ebro, arose in 2001, as a result of the Pharrell-produced collaboration between Birdman and Clipse, \u201cWhat Happened to That Boy?\u201d\nThough I could find no sourcing for this beyond the wisdom of Ebro, the word is that Birdman didn\u2019t pay Pharrell for his work on this track, which is why Pharrell has rarely, if ever, worked with Birdman\u2019s family of artists since. Pusha\u2019s longstanding animosity for all Cash Money artists, then, is a show of loyalty to Pharrell.\nAs of April, Drake seemed to be teasing an upcoming Pharrell collab \u2014 but it never materialized. If in fact this decades-old nonpayment is the source of all Pusha\u2019s animosity, his timing may have had something to do with his pal\u2019s absence from the album.\nAll that really matters in the end is that this is truly excellent beef\nOf course, most of this decades-old context isn\u2019t making it into the mainstream; most onlookers are just enjoying an old-school, epic rap battle of the sort not seen since the \u201990s \u2014 like Tupac\u2019s legendary \u201cHit \u2019Em Up,\u201d his hilarious diss of Biggie Smalls \u2014 or the various shots that Jay-Z, Nas, and 50 Cent traded across the early aughts. These were diss tracks that could escalate the conversation and the genre along with the argument. Similarly, \u201cThe Story of Adidon\u201d isn\u2019t just a diss; it\u2019s great rap, and it\u2019s hard not to sit back and soak up the creative energy being produced by all this drama.\nDrake came with rap punchlines and Pusha hit back with investigative journalism \u2014 Astead (@AsteadWesley) May 30, 2018\nDrake gonna have to send Pusha another invoice for his funeral \u2620\ufe0f \u2014 Tamara Dhia (@tamaradhia) May 30, 2018\nTo say this has excited the populace is putting it mildly.

    "https://variety.com/2019/film/news/doris-day-dead-dies-actress-singer-1203212685/": "Doris Day, one of Hollywood\u2019s most popular stars of the 1950s and \u201960s who was Oscar-nommed for \u201cPillow Talk\u201d and starred in her own TV show, has died. She was 97.\nThe Doris Day Animal Foundation confirmed the legendary actress-singer died on Monday at her Carmel Valley, Calif. home.\nThough she was marketed as a wholesome girl-next-door type, the comedies for which she was most well-known were actually sexy and daring for their time, and her personal life was tumultuous, with four marriages and a notorious lawsuit.\nThe vivacious blonde, who also had a successful singing career, teamed with Rock Hudson in \u201cPillow Talk\u201d and other lighthearted romantic comedies including \u201cLover Come Back\u201d and \u201cSend Me No Flowers.\u201d Her other significant screen roles included Alfred Hitchcock thriller \u201cThe Man Who Knew Too Much\u201d (1956), co-starring James Stewart and featuring Day\u2019s Oscar-winning song \u201cQue Sera Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be\u201d); and \u201cThe Pajama Game\u201d (1957), based on the Broadway musical.\nAfter many successful films, she starred on CBS in \u201cThe Doris Day Show\u201d for five years starting in 1968, and soon after retired to Carmel, Calif. She released 29 albums, most recently \u201cMy Heart,\u201d which consisted of previously unreleased songs, in 2011.\nIn her autobiography, \u201cDoris Day: Her Own Story,\u201d she caused something of a stir while promoting the book by rejecting the \u201cgirl next door\u201d and \u201cprofessional virgin\u201d labels so often attached to her. In the 1975 book she remarked: \u201cThe succession of cheerful, period musicals I made, plus Oscar Levant\u2019s highly publicized comment about my virginity (\u2018I knew Doris Day before she became a virgin\u2019), contributed to what has been called my \u2018image,\u2019 which is a word that baffles me. There never was any intent on my part either in my acting or in my private life to create any such thing as an image.\u201d\nBut her rise in popularity coincided with World War II and the Korean War, and she quickly became a favorite with servicemen. Day leapt into the spotlight in 1945 with the release of her hit song \u201cSentimental Journey,\u201d recorded with Les Brown and His Band of Renown; the song became symbolic for G.I.s returning from WWII to their families. She had also done early vocal work with the big bands of Barney Rapp and Bob Crosby. She had a second hit record with \u201cMy Dreams Are Getting Better All the Time.\u201d\nAfter she separated from her second husband, George Weidler, in 1948, Day apparently intended to leave Los Angeles and return to her mother\u2019s home in Cincinnati. Her agent, Al Levy, convinced her to attend a party at the home of composer Jule Styne. There she performed the song \u201cEmbraceable You,\u201d impressing Styne and partner Sammy Cahn; they recommended her for a role in \u201cRomance on the High Seas,\u201d on which they were then working for Warner Bros. The main role was to be recast after Betty Hutton exited due to pregnancy, and Day got it.\nPHOTOS: Doris Day\u2019s Life and Career in Pictures\nThe Michael Curtiz-directed musical comedy, her debut feature film gig, provided her with another hit recording, the Oscar-nominated \u201cIt\u2019s Magic.\u201d Day starred in a number of Curtiz films in the early and mid-\u201950s, among them \u201cYoung Man With a Horn\u201d with Kirk Douglas and Lauren Bacall.\nIn the early \u201950s she made a series of nostalgic period musicals for Warner Bros., including \u201cTea for Two,\u201d \u201cOn Moonlight Bay\u201d and \u201cBy the Light of the Silvery Moon,\u201d for Warner Brothers. Attempting to cut loose from her dainty image, Day began accepting more nuanced parts, including her favorite role as Western tomboy Calamity Jane in director David Butler\u2019s 1953 film of the same name.\nThe New York Times called Day\u2019s performance in the Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cThe Man Who Knew Too Much,\u201d in which she was well cast as a retired singer, \u201csurprisingly effective.\u201d\nDay was apparently not an immediate fan of \u201cQue Sera Sera\u201d and expressed doubts about the durability of the tune that would become her signature song. It was, however, used again in two more Day films \u2014 \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Eat the Daisies\u201d (1960) and, in a brief duet, in \u201cThe Glass Bottom Boat\u201d (1966) \u2014 and was subsequently used as the theme song for her CBS TV show.\nDay also teamed with James Garner onscreen in 1963\u2019s \u201cThe Thrill of It All\u201d and \u201cMove Over, Darling.\u201d\nHer last film, 1968\u2019s \u201cWith Six You Get Egg Roll,\u201d in which she starred with Brian Keith, was released in the same year as the successful Lucille Ball-Henry Fonda comedy \u201cYours, Mine and Ours,\u201d employing a very similar premise of two people with children from previous marriages coming together.\nIt was also significant because of the ambiguity of certain scenes that could be interpreted as meaning that the central characters slept together before marriage \u2014 a first for a Day character and interesting at a time when comedians were calling her the world\u2019s oldest virgin. She was offered the role of Mrs. Robinson in \u201cThe Graduate,\u201d which could have gone a long way to modernizing what had become a square image, but turned it down because she thought the sexual relationship was exploitative.\nBorn Doris Mary Kappelhoff in Evanston, Ohio, Day was initially interested in dancing but a car accident when she was 13 ended the possibility of such a career. She began singing as a teenager after joining a local dance band, which renamed her Doris Day in honor of her song \u201cDay After Day.\u201d Until her birth certificate surfaced in 2017, she was often reported as having been born in 1924.\nPOPULAR THIS WEEK:\nHer first marriage was to trombonist Al Jorden in 1941, who she was said to have left because of his abusiveness. They had a son, Terry, who was adopted in 1951 by Day\u2019s third husband, agent Marty Melcher, and later became a successful music producer in the 1960s and \u201970s, working with the Beach Boys and Randy Newman. Day\u2019s second marriage to Band of Renown saxophonist Weidler lasted only eight months.\nHusband Melcher and his business partner, Jerome Bernard Rosenthal, secretly squandered her earnings, however, and she won a $22 million judgment against Rosenthal in 1974 (Marty Melcher was already dead), though the case dragged on for years. Son Terry Melcher, who died in 2004, is often mentioned in connection to the Manson murders, as Sharon Tate was killed in the house that he had been renting and he had met Charles Manson when he was an aspiring musician.\nDay was married to restaurant maitre d\u2019 Barry Comden from 1976-81. In 1985 she briefly hosted her own talkshow, \u201cDoris Day\u2019s Best Friends,\u201d on CBN. She received the Golden Globes\u2019 Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement in motion pictures in 1989 and was awarded a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2008, though she did not attend the latter ceremony.\nIn 2004, Day was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom; she opted not to attend the ceremony because of a fear of flying. For the same reason Day did not accept an invitation to be a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors, she said on her website.\nIn Carmel, she became an animal rights advocate and created the Doris Day Animal Foundation. While Day was reluctant to speak to the press or travel to Los Angeles for appearances, she was not a recluse despite reports to the contrary.\nShe is survived by her grandson Ryan.",

Simpson case).\n\u201cFor the People\u201d: ABC has canceled the legal drama after two seasons, which was the second lowest rated of the Shondaland series, averaging almost 3 million total live viewers and a 0.51 in the 18-49 demo.\n\u201cSpeechless\u201d: It\u2019s the third and final season for the single-cam comedy. Maya DiMeo (Minnie Driver) is a mother who will do anything for her children, especially eldest son JJ (Micah Fowler), who has cerebral palsy. While the show was a solid part of ABC\u2019s family comedy lineup for the past few years, the recent season has ranked the lowest rated of the network\u2019s scripted series, averaging 2.3 million total live viewers and a 0.49 in the 18-49 demo.\n\u201cSplitting Up Together\u201d: ABC has pulled the family comedy after two seasons. The show, starring Jenna Fischer and Oliver Hudson as exes who live together and redevelop feelings for each other, was the second-lowest scripted series for the network. It averaged 2.77 total million live viewers and a 0.66 in the 18-49 demographic.\nCBS\n\u201cFam\u201d: CBS said \u201cIt\u2019s a no from me, dawg\u201d to renewing \u201cFam,\u201d the comedy about an engaged couple (Nina Dobrev, Tone Bell) whose lives are disrupted when their 16-year-old relative comes to live with them.\n\u201cHappy Together\u201c: It\u2019s a sad future for \u201cHappy Together,\u201d which CBS pulled after the first season. The comedy starred Damon Wayans, Jr. and Amber Stevens West as a 30-something couple who reconnect with their younger, cooler selves when a pop star (Felix Mallard) is drawn to their ordinary suburban life and unexpectedly moves in with them.\n\u201cLife In Pieces\u201d: Created by Justin Adler and starring Dianne Wiest and James Brolin, the comedy revolved around one big, happy family and their milestone moments. The cancellation arrives only five episodes into the fourth season, which is averaging a 0.84 rating in the 18-49 demo and 5.75 million viewers per episode, representing a dip from last season.\n\u201cMurphy Brown\u201d: Unfortunately, Candice Bergen\u2019s return as the news legend was short lived. The first season of the sitcom concluded after 13 episodes, and CBS opted out of ordering more. The revival saw Brown entering back into the journalism ring amid the 24-hour news cycle and a vastly different political climate than when she (and the show) was last on.\nFox\n\u201cProven Innocent\u201d: The Kelsey Grammar-starring legal drama didn\u2019t light any fires at Fox, where it was canceled after one season. David Elliot served as writer and executive producer on the project, while \u201cEmpire\u201d co-creator Danny Strong and Stacy Greenberg also executive produced. The series centered on a legal team, led by Madeline Scott (Rachelle Lefevre), that reopened investigations, putting their own lives in danger to exonerate the innocent that were \u2018proven\u2019 guilty.\n\u201cThe Cool Kids\u201d: The comedy proved lukewarm for Fox, which canceled the multi-cam after one season. The show hailed from executive producer Charlie Day and starred David Alan Grier, Leslie Jordan, Vicki Lawrence and Martin Mull as four friends in a retirement community who are determined to make the third act of their lives the craziest one yet.\n\u201cThe Gifted\u201d: Set in the Marvel \u201cX-Men\u201d universe, the drama about teenagers with mutant powers couldn\u2019t prevail at Fox. Following the show\u2019s first season, the average rating for Season 2 almost halved down to 0.59, while the average viewership dipped to 1.95 million.\n\u201cLove Connection\u201d: There was no love for the unscripted series, which Fox canceled after two seasons. It was hosted by Andy Cohen and premiered in the summer along with \u201cBeat Shazam.\u201d\n\u201cThe Passage\u201d: The network also closed the chapter on \u201cThe Passage,\u201d based on Justin Cronin\u2019s trilogy of novels. It centered on a young girl (Saniyya Sidney), who is taken by agent Brad Wolgast (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) for a mysterious government experiment, and ends up trying to save her from the same project.\n\u201cRel\u201d: Creator and \u201cGet Out\u201d star Lil Rel Howery couldn\u2019t escape the show\u2019s fate. Canned after one season, the multi-cam comedy featured Howery as a self-made success who has to start over when he finds out his wife is having an affair with his barber. After returning solid ratings for its premiere, \u201cRel\u201d saw a severe ratings dip for the remainder of the series, ending up with an average rating of 0.77 and a hint over 2 million total viewers.\n\u201cLethal Weapon\u201d: Fox has put an end to the one-hour \u201cLethal Weapon\u201d adaptation after three seasons, which might not come as a surprise to those following the drama surrounding the series. The show originally starred Clayne Crawford and Damon Wayans as a buddy cop duo, but the stars\u2019 off-camera fighting led to Crawford\u2019s dismissal. Season 3 continued with Seann William Scott replacing Crawford, but it was the beginning of the end, with Wayans announcing he was quitting, coupled with a steep decline in ratings.\nNBC\n\u201cAP Bio\u201d: Mike O\u2019Brien\u2019s series starring \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\u2019s\u201d Glenn Howerton was the second-lowest rated scripted series for the network in its second season. Howerton starred as a disgraced Harvard philosophy scholar who returned to his Ohio hometown to teach high school biology. Patton Oswalt also starred.\n\u201cI Feel Bad\u201d: NBC\u2019s cancellation of the comedy will no doubt leave fans in a sour mood. The show starred Sarayu Blue as a \u201cperfect mom, boss, wife, friend and daughter\u201d who in real life is far from perfect but figuring things out.",
    "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/who-will-be-next-bachelor-season-23-jason-blake-colton-1202897089/": "SPOILER ALERT: Do not read ahead if you have not watched the season finale of Becca Kufrin\u2019s season of \u201cThe Bachelorette,\u201d which aired Aug. 6 on ABC.\n\u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d Becca Kufrin walked away from the finale with a fianc\u00e9 in Garrett, which means one thing \u2014 Blake is going to be \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d\nNot so fast.\nABC confirms to Variety that the next \u201cBachelor\u201d has not been cast yet, and while there are frontrunners, no decisions have been made when it comes to the next leading man.\nThe network isn\u2019t tasked to make any casting decisions until the end of summer because \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d does not head into production until this September, ahead of its early 2019 premiere. So the casting team will wait to see the audience\u2019s reception to last night\u2019s gut-wrenching finale, which saw Blake get his heart broken, plus the new season of \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d to see which reality stars may become fan-favorites, just like Nick Viall did a few summers back, which ultimately landed him the top spot as \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d\n\u201cThe audience is the silent producer of this show. We want to see who people want to see as \u2018The Bachelor,\u2019\u201d Rob Mills, ABC\u2019s SVP of alternative series, specials & late-night programming, tells Variety. \u201cThere are several candidates, and there\u2019s no consensus from the audience. People have pros and cons on several people. We also want to see when we start talking to girls who will be in the potential cast, who they like.\u201d\nMills suggests that the frontrunners include runner-up Blake and second runner-up Jason, plus Colton, Wills, and even Grocery Store Joe. The executive also says it\u2019s possible ABC could look outside the pool of current contestants.\nWhen asked if the network would ever cast a complete stranger \u2014 someone who has never appeared on any part of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d franchise \u2014 Mills says, \u201c100%. Absolutely.\u201d\n\u201cI think there are some things that are super exciting about that,\u201d Mills continues. \u201cIt would be exciting getting to know someone that we don\u2019t know. But there are also some cons there because I think we are able to service the lead better when we know them really well and know who might be the best partner now. But absolutely \u2014 we\u2019re only hurting ourselves if we don\u2019t look at every option.\u201d\nHere, ABC executive Rob Mills weighs in on the potential frontrunners who could become \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d for Season 13\u2026\nBLAKE:\nThe verdict: Blake is certainly a possibility, but he might be too heartbroken to find love right now\u2026\n\u201cI think Blake will certainly get some traction. I\u2019m going to be fascinated to see what people think or how Blake even feels about it \u2014 is Blake too heartbroken to be \u2018The Bachelor?\u2019 He was torn down to the core. He is so beyond heartbroken. I think he needs to ask himself that and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d\nJASON:\nThe verdict: Jason is definitely in the running\u2026\n\u201cJason, he sort of admitted, he and Becca had insanely strong chemistry and strong feelings, he was a little bit more of a slow burn, so I think he\u2019s ready to jump back in.\u201d\nCOLTON:\nThe verdict: If his storyline pops on \u201cBachelor in Paradise,\u201d there\u2019s a chance\u2026\n\u201cI think we have to watch Colton\u2019s arc on \u2018Bachelor in Paradise.\u2019 You want to look at everything. When we\u2019ve really been rewarded is when we look at as wide of a net as possible, and look at pros and cons.\u201d\nWILLS\nThe verdict: Wills is absolutely in the running. If anything, for his fashion sensibility\u2026\n\u201cWills had a massive following and had a very different approach. His reactions sometimes to some of the guys was priceless. He really called it like it was, and that could be very interesting to see, in terms of dating 25 women. He is also probably the most stylist person we\u2019ve ever had on the history of the show.\u201d\nGROCERY STORE JOE:\nThe verdict: Actually, there is a chance\u2026\n\u201cI mean, do we take a huge left turn? I think everything is a possibility. He\u2019s on \u2018Bachelor In Paradise,\u2019 so we\u2019ve got to watch what the reaction is. There was such a huge following for Grocery Store Joe \u2014 someone that we really know nothing about, but we will know more after \u2018Bachelor In Paradise.\u2019\u201d",
    "https://variety.com/2018/film/news/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-reviews-critics-1202832751/": "Reviews are trickling in for \u201cJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,\u201d and the fifth \u201cJurassic\u201d installment seems to have left critics mostly satisfied, though still yearning for a little more from yet another dinosaur-filled action-adventure ride. \u201cFallen Kingdom\u201d currently sits at a 69% on Rotten Tomatoes, a dip from its 2015 predecessor, \u201cJurassic World,\u201d which finished at a 71%.\n\u201cFallen Kingdom\u201d star Chris Pratt comes in hot after his appearance as Star-Lord in \u201cAvengers: Infinity War.\u201d Directed by \u201cA Monster Calls\u201d helmer J.A. Bayona, the movie was written by \u201cJurassic World\u201d director Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly.\nVariety\u2019s own Owen Gleiberman said the film reminded him more of 1970s disaster movie than a dinosaur picture, but praised Pratt\u2019s performance, noting he \u201cexudes a lean-and-mean sincerity.\u201d\n\u201cJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\u201d hits theaters on June 22. Read below to see what critics think about the franchise\u2019s newest reptile ride.\nVariety\u2019s Owen Glieberman:\n\u201cThe first \u2018Jurassic World\u2019 was, quite simply, not a good ride. \u2018Fallen Kingdom\u2019 is an improvement, but it\u2019s the first \u2018Jurassic\u2019 film to come close to pretending that it isn\u2019t a ride at all, and as a result it ends up being just a so-so ride. I hope the next one is an all-out ride \u2014 but that for the first time since Spielberg\u2019s 1993 original, it\u2019s actually a great one. The audience for this series has proved that it will turn out in mega-droves. But it deserves more than a passable rerun taking itself too seriously.\u201d\nNew York Post\u2019s Johnny Oleksinski:\n\u201c\u2018Fallen Kingdom\u2019 is a more interesting, and less obvious, story than the usual Tyrannosaurus romps, which tend to be death-defying games of hide-and-seek. But you can hear the eye rolls during an 11th-hour twist involving the benevolent billionaire\u2019s granddaughter, which is way too philosophical for a film where dudes\u2019 heads are bitten off by lizards. Jeff Goldblum, making a cameo appearance as Dr. Ian Malcolm, provides all the high-mindedness we need as he natters on about chaos theory in an early monologue.\u201d\nIGN\u2019s Gav Murphy:\n\u201cJ.A. Bayona feels like the perfect director to take control of \u2018Fallen Kingdom\u2019 after proving he can handle large-scale destruction with confidence but is equally capable of delivering intimate scares. There are echoes of his previous works such as The Impossible (big old natural disaster) and The Orphanage (creepy old secret-filled house) in \u2018Fallen Kingdom\u2019 but more impressive is how it draws on further inspirations like Alfred Hitchcock and Hammer horror style suspense. The latter is definitely felt throughout the film and Bayona\u2019s use of light and shadows to create tension is one of the highlights of \u2018Fallen Kingdom.\u2019 Whether it\u2019s a toothy Baryonyx stalking through a tunnel lit by a menacing drop of lava or the claws of the terrifying new Indoraptor illuminated by a child\u2019s night-light, Bayona\u2019s horror seems classy and rarely resorts to simply jump scares.\u201d\nIndieWire\u2019s Eric Kohn:\n\u201cIn the wake of the box-office lunacy that drove \u2018Jurassic World\u2019 to become the fifth-highest grossing movie of all time, \u2018Fallen Kingdom\u2019 is a frustrating display of overconfidence. It\u2019s occasionally elevated by director J.A. Bayona\u2019s penchant for taut human-versus-dino showdowns, but fleeting moments of inspired filmmaking can\u2019t overshadow the broader tendency of this material to sag into stupidity. Campy dialogue and ludicrous plot twists abound: The fate of these resurrected creatures remains uncertain, but the formula for their movies will never go extinct.\u201d\nThe Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw:\n\u201cThere are some reasonably entertaining scenes and set pieces, but the whole concept feels tired and contrived, and crucially the dinosaurs themselves are starting to look samey, without inspiring much of the awe or terror they used to. It could be that a meteor of tedium is heading towards these CGI creatures, despatching them to extinction.\u201d\ni09\u2019s Germain Lussier:\n\u201cNone of the characters really stand out, either. Claire and Owen basically just become slightly more self-aware versions of themselves. Mills is never an intimidating villain. Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum returning to his classic role) is criminally underused. Lockwood\u2019s importance to the franchise feels incredibly forced and, as a result, much of the logic behind the franchise gets undercut and subverted. A few things happen toward the end of \u2018Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\u2019 that are likely to induce groans more than cheers.\u201d\nVanity Fair\u2019s Richard Lawson:\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m all that eager to see what becomes of our prehistoric pals next, but at least their latest adventure gives them proper consideration. There\u2019s a scene in \u2018Fallen Kingdom\u2019 that will stay with me for a little while: a lone brontosaurus, standing on a shore nearly engulfed in ash and flame, stretching its long neck up to the sky and braying out a mournful plaint. In the context of the film, it\u2019s supposed to be saying, \u2018Come back, save me.\u2019 But I don\u2019t know; I think it\u2019s possible that, having had enough, this behemoth is actually saying goodbye. Watching it grandly fade into nothing, I found myself wishing that, for once, someone would honor its wishes.\u201d\nAV Club\u2019s Jesse Hassenger:\n\u201cThese movies often literally retread the same ground as their predecessors, encountering layers of detritus from those other movies in the process. (The original \u2018Jurassic Park\u2019 cars are briefly rediscovered here, just as they were last time around.) The thematic work of \u2018Fallen Kingdom\u2019 is scribbly and half-finished, a series of dopey riffs on what came before about humans living with the consequences of their scientific meddling. But as a lava-spewing, raptor-training, teeth-gnashing, monster-in-the-basement creature feature, it has a certain freshness.\u201d\nEntertainment Weekly\u2019s Chris Nashawaty:\n\u201cNeedless to say, idealism butts heads with greed, children will be put in peril, doublecrosses will be doublecrossed, and a menagerie of various CG raptors and rexes will pop up to serve well-timed scares to younger moviegoers, including a bit of run-amok mayhem off of the island that\u2019s like a haunted house version of The Lost World\u2018s San Diego sequence. Howard, thankfully, gets more to do than the last go round (and in combat boots, no less!), Pratt busts out his signature Indiana Jones cocktail of can-do heroism and deadpan sarcasm, and Bayona and his screenwriters (Trevorrow and Derek Connolly) test the laws of incredulity with varying degrees of success. At least, until the final half hour when forehead-slapping hooey finally win out. Up until then, \u2018Fallen Kingdom\u2019 is exactly the kind of escapist summer behemoth you want it to be.\u201d\nCinemaBlend\u2019s Mike Reyes:\n\u201c\u2018Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\u2019 is a high-class summer blockbuster, with some unexpected emotions, a heap of the action that one would expect from such a film, and a dash of surprisingly dark moments that folks have been waiting for since Michael Crichton\u2019s book first hit shelves. This movie needs to be enjoyed in a setting that is as big and as loud as you can get it, simply because it deserves to loom larger-than-life over its audience. It\u2019s a shame that J.A. Bayona isn\u2019t returning for the third film, as his direction is a breath of fresh air in a series that seems to be setting up for a killer continuation and/or finale in the third planned film. In the here and now, this is the sort of dinosaur romp that makes the \u2018Jurassic World\u2019 saga something to pay attention to.\u201d",

While veteran actor Nana Patekar has denied all the allegations against him, filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri has finally confessed to the molestation charges weeks after he slapped her with a notice of referring him while accusing him of sexually harassing her during the shoot of the 2005 film Chocolate: Deep Dark Secrets.\nTanushree Dutta\u2019s counsel, Nitin Satpute told a leading daily that Tanushree Dutta never pressed any charges against Agnihotri at the press conference. According to the reports, the director had asked Tanushree to strip off her clothes and dance to give cues to an actor, all this, behind the camera. Satpute further told the daily that it was the director who confessed to the crimes in a 10-page notice that he sent to Tanushree where he stated that \u2018the director was none other than me.\u2019 He further stated that since the director has himself owned up to the crime and they will be submitting an official complaint against him at the Oshiwara police station requesting the cops to press molestation charges against him.\nAlong with Nana Patekar, Tanushree has accused three more of sexual harassment and now have even filed a case against Rakhi Sawant who tried to threaten Dutta and said \u2018Tujhse to main niptungi...Ghar me ghus ke marungi.\u2019 (I will deal with you and beat you inside your house). Talking about the same, Satpute, also a member of the Bhim Army stated that they have submitted a complaint letter at the Oshiwara Police station and requested the cops to register the case under SC/ST Atrocity Act. He also stated that they (Bhim Army) will file an FIR against Sawant.\nReiterating her decade-old harassment allegations against Nana Patekar, Tanushree said earlier that such cases are not taken seriously in India but she is confident that she will get justice. She said, \"I am hoping I will get justice. But not figured out what kind of justice I will get. There are rules and regulations, things are tweaked and twisted and there is corruption so justice gets delayed.\u201d\nMore Bollywood stories and picture galleries\nFor all latest news and updates, stay tuned to our Facebook page\nLatest Entertainment News",
    "https://www.elitedaily.com/p/the-amazon-echo-vs-amazon-echo-dot-have-a-key-difference-to-know-about-9768822": "In case you haven't heard, Amazon Prime Day is quickly approaching. The online sale is set to kick off on July 16 at 3 p.m. ET and it's offering loads of incredible deals. So, for those customers who are looking to up their technology game but can't decide which device to buy, here's what we know about Amazon Echo vs. Amazon Echo Dot.\nAccording to Digital Trends, there's not too many differences between the two smart speakers, but the differences they do have matter. While both of them feature the infamous Amazon-enabled voice assistant, Alexa, they do function differently. The Amazon Echo is great for music fans because of its cylinder speaker, while the Echo Dot caters mainly to voice command. There are a few other differences that might impact that shopping cart. Both items are about the same size in diameter, but the Echo's cylinder shape makes it a lot taller and heavier than the Echo Dot which resembles more of a hockey puck shape. In regards to speaker quality, listeners will get a louder and more defined sounds from the Echo, due to its larger and 360-surround speaker. Plus, obviously, the Echo is going to cost customers a bit more since it sells for $100 as opposed to the Echo Dot's $35 price tag.\nBasically, if you're looking to kick back at your house and chill out with some surround-sound tunes, the Echo might be your best bet. However, if you're wanting to take the speakers on the road with you or just want to order Seamless from your couch without picking up your phone, Echo Dot will definitely suit your needs.\nIs anyone else as excited about Amazon Prime Day as I am? Doubtful, but I'll let you believe so. July 16 will mark the fourth annual cyber sale courtesy of the online retailer, and it's shaping up to be better than ever. Not only has Amazon extended Prime Day to 36 hours, as opposed to its usual 30, but it's also being brought to countries far and wide including the U.K., Spain, Mexico, Japan, India, Italy, Germany, France, China, Canada, Belgium, and Austria.\nSo how can you cop these high technology goodies? First of all, you need to be an Amazon Prime member to take part in the special online holiday. Then, just add the Echo or Echo Dot on your \"watch\" list on Amazon, and wait for that glorious notification that your item has gone on sale. Or, feel free to pop over to Amazon's Prime Day page on their website and click on all the featured sale items.\nIn case you're not totally sold (pun intended) on the Echo or Echo Dot, there's another option that might tickle a customer's fancy. Amazon's Echo Show will also be on sale during Amazon Prime Day for $130, as opposed to its usual $300. With the Echo Show, the classic Alexa-enabled voice will still be present, but what makes this device different from its other Echo siblings is that it features a screen that allows people actually see videos, music lyrics, weather forecasts, to-do lists, and best of all it's completely hands free. To be honest, I think customers should buy all three products. Amazon Prime Day only happens once a year after all.\nShopping in a store might be a nice experience to some people, but for me, there's nothing I love more than filling up a shopping cart in the comfort of my pajamas. Sadly, Amazon Prime Day kicks off on Monday, July 16 in the afternoon, so I guess I'll have to make some orders in the comfort of my work clothes. The online mega sale runs until Wednesday, July 17 at 3 a.m. ET, so mark your calendars, everyone and prepare to shop until you drop.\nWhether you opt for the big and bold Amazon Echo or the daintier Amazon Echo Dot, before you know it they'll be on your doorstep like it's Christmas in July.",

    "https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/reviews/samsung/147138-samsung-galaxy-s10e-review": "(Pocket-lint) - With top tier smartphones pushing higher and costing more, it's created something of a gap between the sub-\u00a3500 market dominated by the likes of Xiaomi and OnePlus. Apple addressed this by launching the iPhone XR, which offers a very similar experience to the flagship XS/XS Max.\nIt doesn't have all of the same sparkly features that the more expensive Galaxy S10 and S10+ phones have but it keeps the power without the price. Samsung has more recently added the S10 Lite to the picture, offering another rival to the selection of S10 phones.\nThank you to Vodafone UK for supplying us with this review unit.\nsquirrel_widget_147138\nPOCKET-LINT VIDEO OF THE DAY\nOur quick take On the whole, the Samsung Galaxy S10e is a powerful, palm-friendly smartphone that's ready to compete head-on with the iPhone XS and the Pixel 3. And in many ways it comes out on top. It would be easy to point at the S10e's feature list and say it's not as exciting as the Galaxy S10 or S10+. But having used it for a while, we've come to realise it's not really missing anything that matters - except maybe that telephoto zoom camera and the in-screen fingerprint sensor. We might've come in expecting to be critical of this lesser featured Galaxy phone, but we've come away wanting nothing. In many ways it's simply the smaller Galaxy option for those who don't want a giant phone. By no means is it the poor-man's Galaxy we thought it might be.\n4.5 stars - Pocket-lint recommended For All the power and performance of the bigger models\nNo curved screen edges is a good thing Against Only dual camera versus S10's triple system\nDesign is a bit toy-ish in some colours\nsquirrel_147138\nDesign\nExternal fingerprint sensor\nIP68 water and dust resistant\n142 x 70 x 7.9mm, 150g\nGlance at it from the front and you could be forgiven for thinking the S10e is part of the iPhone X family. It has that flat screen with rounded corners and shiny rounded metal edges. But there's enough here on a second glance to dispel those initial impressions.\nFirstly, there's no hint of that hefty notch that's become the silhouette synonymous with Apple's latest phones. Instead, the S10e has the single cutout camera within the display, similar to the Galaxy S10.\nSecondly, the bottom bezel (or 'chin' as we so often call it) isn't the same thickness as the edges. It's thicker, which means the bottom corners of the screen don't perfectly fit in with the rounded corners of the frame. It's not terrible to look at, by any means, but it would look better if the screen stretched a little further and pushed closer into the bottom corners. Still, it's easily ignorable once you get used to the phone.\nNow, because the Galaxy S10e doesn't have the in-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor that the S10 and S10+ have, Samsung had to come up with a way to include a fingerprint scanner without adding hefty thickness to the screen's frame. Rather than put one on to the back, beneath the camera like previous phones, Samsung has built it in to the right edge, in the wake/sleep button.\nIt's placement is well considered. It's not exactly at the natural thumb height, which means you're unlikely to press and unlock accidentally. You have to slide the phone slightly to get to it, which is a minor inconvenience that staves off constant irritation at unintended unlocks. What's more, the volume and Bixby buttons are on the opposite side, which is so much better than, say, Sony's method of cramming them all together on the same side.\nAs a whole, the S10e is a neat package. The glass very subtly curves towards the metal edges, creating an almost seamless look and feel, while the polished metal gives it a real high-end look. With that said, the baby blue-ish tint on the prism white model does give it a bit of a \"kids' phone\" vibe, as does the dual camera protrusion with its silver finish.\nScreen time\n5.8-inch AMOLED panel\n1080 x 2280 resolution, 438ppi\nHDR10+ compliant\nThe interesting thing about this display is that it's smaller, at 5.8-inches, compared to the 6.1- and 6.4-inch displays of the bigger S10 and S10+. That makes for neater one-handed holding. But while the S10e's is a lower resolution (Full HD+ versus Quad HD+) the difference in terms of detail is quite minimal, because it still has in impressive pixel density and is built using the same AMOLED technology as its siblings.\nHere's the crux: despite the S10 and S10+ having QHD displays, Samsung sets them to Full HD by default, so you have to go into the settings to max out the resolution, which we presume most people will not be doing.\nA benefit of this screen is that it's completely flat - which means you don't get any of the slight distortion towards the edges that you might get on the curved edges of its bigger family members.\nThis means it's actually really great for gaming, watching movies or just about anything else you want to do on your phone. It's the ideal mobile Netflix screen, and if you choose the right HDR equipped shows, it can look really stunning.\nPerformance, battery and One UI\nExynos 9820 processor\n6GB/8GB RAM\n128GB/256GB storage\n3,100mAh battery\nAndroid Pie-based One UI\nWe've spoken about the changes in Samsung's software already - take a look at our detailed feature, here - and whichever Galaxy S10 model you choose the software is identical. So we won't go into too much detail on that here, except to say that it's equal parts great and also not so great.\nPocket-lint\nWe love the fluidity of the animations, the new overall shape and feel of notifications, the recent apps and app drawer. We're not big fans of the new default app icons though, as they seem a big too colourful and child-like. What's more, certain apps and screens just have too much space in them. Swipe down on Settings, for example, and the top \"Settings\" menu name fills half the screen.\nThe important thing is that it all runs really smoothly and effortlessly using the new Exynos processor. It doesn't seem to matter what game or app you load, it does so without a stutter. It's very responsive and quick.\nSimilarly, battery life never caused us an issue either. It may only be 3,100mAh (compared to 3,400mAh and 4,100mAh in the other S10 models), but it's powering a smaller, lower resolution screen, and therefore this battery lasts comfortably through a busy work day. Just charge it every night and we don't foresee any battery life shortage issues. It's got generally all most people need.\nThere's versatility and convenience in charging too, with both wired and wireless charging options available. On the downside, however, Samsung seems to be lagging behind the likes of Oppo and Huawei when it comes to charging quickly. The S10e has 15W fast-charging - which isn't anything close to the rapid charging that either of the big Chinese companies offer. If you're a \"plug it in at night and leave it 'til morning\" kind of person then this won't bother you, but it won't fill up as much in that quick 15-20 mins before rushing out as you'd be able to achieve with Oppo's 50W Super VOOC charging or Huawei's 40W SuperCharge.\nCamera\nDual camera\n12MP dual-aperture primary\n16MP ultrawide\nHardware and performance of the camera on the S10e is just like the S10 and S10+ - except its missing the telephoto 2x zoom lens. That means you get the ultra-wide and the primary 12-megapixel wide camera.\nWe won't go into too much detail here, since we've already covered it in the Galaxy S10+, but results and performance is great in most conditions. There's plenty of fun to be had with AR emoji and the super slow-motion video.\nPocket-lint\nThe one place Samsung currently doesn't match its rivals is in night modes. With the likes of the Google Pixel, Huawei and Oppo phones all offering super night modes of various degrees, Samsung needs to advance here.\nStill, photos from the S10e in moderate-to-good light come out sharp and well balanced, although sometimes have a tendency to come out a little overexposed from the main camera.\nsquirrel_widget_147138\nTo recap On the whole, the Samsung Galaxy S10e is a powerful, palm-friendly smartphone that's ready to compete head-on with the iPhone XS and the Pixel 3. And in many ways it comes out on top.\nWriting by Cam Bunton. Editing by Stuart Miles.",
    "https://www.stereogum.com/2019891/rapper-jon-james-dies-in-video-stunt/news/": "A Canadian rapper fell to his death from the wing of an airplane Saturday when a music video stunt went wrong. The Canadian Press reports that 34-year-old Calgary native Jon James McMurray, who performed under the name Jon James, was walking on the wing of a small Cessna when the plane went into a downward spiral. McMurray was found dead in a field near Westwold, British Columbia.\nA statement from McMurray\u2019s management details what happened:\nHe died filming for a project he had been working on for months. His final act included performing an airplane stunt that included rapping while walking on the wing. He had trained intensely for the stunt, however, as Jon got further out onto the wing of the plane, it caused the small Cessna to go into a downward spiral that the pilot couldn\u2019t correct. Jon held onto the wing until it was too late, and by the time he let go, he didn\u2019t have time to pull his chute. He impacted and died instantly.\nMcMurray, who was based in Los Angeles, was a former professional skier who switched to music after suffering career-ending injuries including a broken back and shattered heel. Before taking up rapping, he performed in a rock band. He often performed stunts in his videos, such as the gymnastics move he pulls in the opening seconds of his recent \u201cI Am\u201d video. He performed at events including the Canadian music and extreme sports festival Center Of Gravity and recently collaborated with Riff Raff on a song called \u201cThe Man,\u201d which appears to be the song he was filming a video for. A clip posted on his Instagram three weeks ago previews the making of the video.",

    "https://www.techadvisor.com/article/732304/captain-marvel-release-date-cast-trailers-news.html": "Captain Marvel is one of the most anticipated films of 2019, and for good reason. Not only is it the next Marvel movie, it\u2019s also the one heavily teased by the Infinity War post-credit scene, the final film before Avengers: Endgame, and the first Marvel solo movie to boast a female lead.\nExciting stuff then \u2013 especially with renowned actress Brie Larson in the title role. Here\u2019s everything we know about the film so far.\nAlso see: Does Captain Marvel have a post-credit scene?\nFirst up, Captain Marvel comes out early next year, with a cinema release currently scheduled for 8 March 2019, just a couple of months before Avengers: Endgame hits screens in late April/early May (depending on which side of the Atlantic you\u2019re on) to inevitably shake up the whole Marvel universe.\nAfter hitting cinemas, the film will do something a little different. It\u2019ll still come out on Blu-ray and digital as normal, but instead of eventually heading to the likes of Netflix, it will be the first major film to be exclusive to the new Disney+ streaming service, set to launch later this year.\nIs there a trailer?\nYup! It took Marvel a while, but it finally used Good Morning America to reveal the first teaser trailer for the film, which you can watch right here:\nThen December brought us an early Christmas present: a second trailer for the movie, teasing more of Carol\u2019s back story and showing off her powers at full force:\nMarvel even saw fit to lift our January blues with yet another look at the film \u2013 this Special Look shows off a few of Carol\u2019s powers and gives us a glimpse of Clark Gregg\u2019s Agent Coulson back in action:\nThen the Super Bowl came around to give us what\u2019s probably our final proper look at the film: a 30-second spot that\u2019s built around the \u2018Higher. Further. Faster.\u2019 tagline:\nPosters and photos\nHere is that first official look at Larson in costume, from the cover of Entertainment Weekly:\nEW also released ten exclusive images from the film (a few of which are behind the scenes) showing off an even better look at the costume, along with a few of the films other characters \u2013 and the first big screen appearance of the iconic Marvel alien race the Skrulls:\nWe also have a few official posters for the film:\nCast and crew\nSo, the headline news is that the movie\u2019s star is Brie Larson, the latest in a long line of acclaimed actors that Marvel has lured over to put on the tights and cape. She plays Carol Danvers \u2013 aka Captain Marvel \u2013 with superhuman strength and flight, and a mess of other powers that honestly leave her a bit similar to Superman.\nShe\u2019ll be joined by Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders as SHIELD agents Nick Fury and Maria Hill, respectively, in a story that\u2019s meant to be mostly set in the \u201990s (once again throwing off the whole muddled Marvel timeline) \u2013 meaning we\u2019ll get a younger Fury, apparently even pre-eye patch. Even Clark Gregg\u2019s Coulson is coming back (after a long run as the lead of the Agents of SHIELD TV show) as a younger version of himself.\nThe rest of the cast includes Lee Pace and Djimon Hounsou (both reprising their roles from Guardians of the Galaxy), along with new roles for Gemma Chan, Ben Mendelsohn, Jude Law, and Annette Bening.\nBehind the camera, the film will be co-directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, both making their blockbuster debuts after a string of TV and indie film work. They also contributed to the screenplay, which includes a whopping five other writer credits.\nPlot rumours\nSo, what do we know about the film? Not a huge amount, in all honesty. We know it\u2019s set in the \u201990s \u2013 though the casting of Cobie Smulders suggests there may be some sort of present-day framing device at work \u2013 and we know it\u2019s going to serve as an intro for Danvers, who in the comics got her powers after an accident fused her genetic structure with that of an alien (from a race called the Kree) by the name of Mar-Vell \u2013 we reckon that\u2019s Jude Law in the movie.\nWe\u2019re not actually getting an origin story though, as Entertainment Weekly reports that when the movie begins, Danvers will already have her powers, and that \u201cshe\u2019s left her earthly life behind to join an elite Kree military team called Starforce, led by Jude Law\u2019s enigmatic commander.\u201d\nThe second trailer reveals more of the specifics. It looks like Danvers will be in some sort of accident during her Air Force days which will leave her in the hands of the Kree, where Annette Bening\u2019s scientist rebuilds her as a Kree warrior \u2013 with no memory of her Earth life. Those memories are going to come flashing back to her from the looks of things though, and we\u2019re guessing the film\u2019s central mystery will be exactly how Danvers ended up with the Kree.\nA Funko Pop reveal (now the staple of superhero movie leaks) also hints that she\u2019ll go by a different name when among the Kree. The toys include both her costumes, but the green Kree one dubs her \u2018Vers\u2019 \u2013 clearly some sort of shortening of Danvers that might fit in a bit better with all of her buddies\u2019 alien names.\nOne oddity is that the cast are dancing around whether or not Law is playing Mar-Vell \u2013 who was in fact the first Captain Marvel in the comics. We know his character is the leader of Starforce, and Law himself said that \u201che\u2019s almost a devout warrior\u2014unquestioning, conservative, but inspirational,\u201d along with being a mentor to Danvers. All that fits Mar-Vell, but Marvel just won\u2019t confirm the name for some reason.\nThe film will include both the Kree and another race called the Skrulls, showing the two of them at war with one another \u2013 another comics staple. We\u2019ve already seen the Kree before of course \u2013 they were the baddies in the first Guardians, led by Lee Pace\u2019s Ronan the Accuser, who\u2019s conveniently returning here to help tie things together.\nAs for the Skrulls, they\u2019re a shape-shifting alien race who have caused all sorts of havoc in the comics \u2013 including replacing most of earth\u2019s heroes with Skrull duplicates in Secret Invasion, which has long been one of the popular fan theories about what plot Avengers: Endgame might follow. Here they\u2019ll be led by Ben Mendelsohn\u2019s Talos, who\u2019s spearheading an invasion of Earth while disguised as a SHIELD agent, which is likely how Danvers finds herself back on her home planet.\nSpeaking of SHIELD, Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s Nick Fury will play a major role, appearing as a young agent (using Marvel\u2019s digital de-aging tech for basically the whole movie) who\u2019ll meet his very first superhero \u2013 no doubt sowing the seeds for the Avengers Initiative.\nAnd of course we also know that Captain Marvel will somehow make it to that Avengers movie, and likely prove crucial to the plot \u2013 Infinity War\u2018s post-credit sting saw agents Fury and Hill trigger some sort of signal on a device bearing the Captain Marvel insignia just before Thanos dusted them, clearly hoping Danvers would prove crucial to setting things right again \u2013 so somehow, some way, Marvel is going to tie it all together.\nThat might even tie directly into rumours of time travel featuring in Endgame, as Samuel L.

Finally.\nThe sitcom first debuted in September 2007 after its original pilot, which included two female lead characters, was not picked up by any network. Television executives felt the premise of the show had potential so a second pilot was filmed, which lead to CBS ordering a 13-episode first season. Little did they (or anybody else) know, The Big Bang Theory would rank as one of the most popular television shows of all-time.\nThat run will be concluding, however, as Warner Bros. Television, CBS and Chuck Lorre Productions announced in a joint statement The Big Bang Theory will be canceled after its twelfth and final season.\n\u201cWe are forever grateful to our fans for their support of The Big Bang Theory during the past twelve seasons,\u201d the producers said. \u201cWe, along with the cast, writers and crew, are extremely appreciative of the show\u2019s success and aim to deliver a final season and series finale, that will bring The Big Bang Theory to an epic creative close.\u201d\nNo official word has yet been given as to why CBS decided to cancel The Big Bang Theory after nearly 300 episodes, although speculations have been swirling that Jim Parsons, who plays nerdy Sheldon Cooper, is no longer interested in participating after turning down a $50 million payday. Oh, come on, they\u2019re all nerdy.\nFellow cast members, like the always stunning Kaley Cuoco, who plays Penny, couldn\u2019t help but voice their disappointment on social media (below) when news of the cancellation was made public.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Bmy2eBbFk6z/?taken-by=normancook\nThe final season of The Big Bang Theory will debut Monday, Sept. 24 at 8/7c on CBS before moving to its regular time period on Thursday, Sept. 27 at 8/7c.\nThe show\u2019s actors and producers have promised an \u201cepic\u201d series finale. Hopefully, the writers will finally address that whole broken elevator snafu before giving way to The Big Bang Theory spin-off prequel Young Sheldon, which will debut its second season directly after TBBT\u2019s season premiere.\nIt\u2019s never going to end, is it?",

The district says it does not come across drivers passing stopped buses often.\n\"We haven't had a real issue with it where it's been a huge safety concern,\" transportation supervisor Jim Nestico said.\nSometimes, drivers will attempt to pass school buses slowing down for pickups despite the flashing yellow lights.\n\"[They] try to scoot around us because they don't want to stop and get stuck behind us,\" Denise Lorenz Giordano explained.

    "https://www.livescience.com/62979-nurse-shark-bites-womans-finger.html": "Because apparently, it needs to be said: Don't put your fingers anywhere near a nurse shark's teeth.\nA woman who tried to hand-feed a shark is lucky she still has a hand. Yes, it bit her. IT'S A SHARK.\nMelissa Brunning of Perth, Australia, was on a holiday yacht cruise in Dugong Bay on Australia's coast, when four tawny nurse sharks (Nebrius ferrugineus) swam close to the back of the boat, Perth Now reported. Several of Brunning's companions dropped fish in the water near the sharks, one of which measured almost 7 feet (2 meters) in length.\nHowever, when it was Brunning's turn, she tried to feed the shark directly by hand. As the shark snatched the food, its jaws closed on her finger, and it yanked her into the water \u2014 a terrifying moment that one of her friends captured on video, according to Perth Now. [Images: Sharks & Whales from Above]\nIn the footage, which was shared on Twitter by Australia's 7 News Melbourne on July 1, Brunning is seen bending toward the water, food in hand, as a nurse shark swims by. As it comes nearer, she puts her hand down into the water next to its head \u2014 and then screams as the shark bites down on her finger and pulls her in.\n\"It happened so quickly,\" Brunning told 7 News Melbourne, and the pain was so excruciating that she initially thought her finger had been bitten off completely.\n\"It felt like it was shredding off the bone,\" she said. \"I couldn't even look at the finger because I thought it was gone.\"\nSee more\nBut after the shark released Brunning's finger, she found that it was still very much attached to her hand, though severely lacerated. Because the location where she was on holiday was so remote, she didn't seek treatment until nearly two weeks later, by which time her finger was badly infected, and X-rays revealed that she had suffered a torn ligament and a bone fracture, according to 7 News Melbourne.\nTawny nurse sharks, also known as spitting sharks and sleepy sharks, are found in coastal waters spanning from east to west along Australia's northern coast. They are \"relatively stout\" sharks with blunt snouts holding rows of sharp teeth, and they can grow to be as long as 10.5 feet (3.2 m), representatives of the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries wrote in a species description.\nThe accident was unquestionably harrowing, but labeling it a \"shark attack,\" as 7 News Melbourne did, is misleading, as Brunning literally put a handful of food \u2014 and her hand \u2014 into the shark's mouth voluntarily; the animal simply reacted as it normally would in the presence of food, ecologist and shark researcher David Shiffman, a research fellow at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada, wrote in a tweet on July 2.\nSee more\nAt least Brunning acknowledged her responsibility for the incident, adamantly affirming that it was entirely her fault, that the shark was blameless and that she was very, very lucky that her injury wasn't \"a lot worse,\" she told Perth Now.\nBrunning said her future interactions with marine wildlife will be better informed thanks to her harrowing experience, as she intends to \"respect marine life, and look at it in awe, but just leave them alone,\" Perth Now reported.\nOriginal article on Live Science.",
    "https://www.phillyvoice.com/nba-playoffs-sixers-raptors-preview-joel-embiid-marc-gasol/": "There are not many players in the league who can claim to have flummoxed Joel Embiid through the first three seasons of his career. The Sixers' franchise player is a walking nightmare for opponents \u2014 he draws fouls at an elite rate, he's as big and strong as anybody in the league, and he has the touch of a player half his size. You can't put him on the line, you can't concede mid-range jumpers, and most of the time you can't hope to stand him up in the post.\nToronto's Marc Gasol, however, is not like most of the matchups Embiid faces around the league. No one this side of Al Horford has proven better equipped to stop Embiid since he entered the league.\nAs a continuation of our series looking at individual matchups before the series begins in Toronto, let's take a look at what the numbers say about Embiid vs. Gasol, the competing interests in Toronto and Philadelphia, and where we might all end up when the dust settles.\nToronto's trade for Gasol was made with this matchup in mind\nGrabbing Gasol at the trade deadline this year was a statement of intent from the Raptors. Kawhi Leonard is an unrestricted free agent this offseason, and Toronto has spent all season trying to convince him to stick around for the long-term despite the noise that he will flee for Los Angeles come July. Rather than playing it safe and hoping the incumbents would be enough to do so, the Raptors sought out an upgrade to make a real run at the title this year.\n\"When you look at what Milwaukee did or the 76ers did or Toronto did prior to the trade deadline, everybody loaded up,\" Brett Brown said Thursday. \"It was an arms race for the Eastern Conference Championship. Gasol was an incredible acquisition for them, he really fits perfectly to the point where after the trade was made, they're the best three-point shooting team in the NBA.\"\nTo get there, the Raptors will have to get through Embiid's Sixers. And while Gasol's skill package is useful for any team, the veteran center is particularly important if your goal is to slow down the big man from Cameroon.\nThe NBA only provides matchup data for the last two seasons, but Embiid's numbers against Gasol when he was still with the Grizzlies were an absolute trainwreck relative to his lofty standards. Embiid is 10/29 from the field on possessions where Gasol has covered him the last two seasons, a drop-off of 14 percentage points from his season averages over that time. It is in many ways a product of his shot selection \u2014 Embiid is 0/9 on threes with Gasol guarding him, which we'll revisit in a second.\nIf you ask the head coach, Embiid's struggles against Gasol are pretty easy to understand.\n\"His experience, combined with his sort of physical gifts and intellect, make it sort of [an] apples for apples body type matchup. It's not like you have [Jarrett Allen] on him,\" Brown said Thursday. \"You get to the other end of the floor, Marc is an incredible quarterback passing from wherever. Passing out of pick-and-roll, passing in trail, he doesn't to me at this stage of the career need to be a high-volume shot guy, he's a great distributor.\"\nThose two halves of the whole are not disconnected. Gasol can step out and shoot threes and attack you as a passer, which puts stress on Embiid on the defensive end of the floor. Embiid has thrived against some of his matchups with big, traditional centers, but most of them don't have the passing and/or shooting talent of Gasol.\nHow does Gasol present problems?\nThe short version of the answer \u2014 it's going to take some problem-solving from the coaching staff and the players on the floor.\n\"To feel you're just going to turn out JJ, throw the ball to JJ, and dump it into Joel with Gasol on him would be pretty naive. You need a greater plan than that,\" Brown said. \"I gotta do a good job of helping free Joel up.\"\nIt will be up to Toronto to decide how they want to defend Embiid with Gasol on the floor, but I can't imagine it will be all that different than most gameplans look against him at this point. When Gasol was in Memphis, they were aggressive leaving Embiid open from behind the three-point line, and he wasn't able to make them pay. There's nothing Gasol is doing here to prevent Embiid from making this shot:\nLooking back at the away trip to Memphis this year, I think there's a case to be made that Embiid simply had tired legs. The Sixers were on a back-to-back and woefully shorthanded after agreeing to the trade that brought Jimmy Butler in the day of the game, and Jaren Jackson Jr. gave Embiid plenty of problems when he tried to set up shop on the low block, too.\nThe game in Philly offered more insight, but there is context to consider there, too. Many of Embiid's misses came late in the shot clock in that game, and not on plays where he just dribbled out the clock by himself. The stats count the same, but it's not necessarily about a particular struggle with Gasol if Embiid misses a late-clock jumper after responsibility fell into his lap at the last second.\nThat said, there are times when those late-clock shots are a reflection of the battle with Gasol. The vet makes you work hard to establish position against him, ditto when you try to hold it. Gasol is a master of leaning into you enough to keep you off-balance without resorting to the pushing or tugging that leads to foul calls.\nFace Gasol up, and you run into a lot of the same problems. He has never been especially quick, but he doesn't necessarily need to be. He will sit back in a stance and establish his footing, preparing for the moment you make contact.\nYou can't go through him, and the Sixers will want to avoid a world where they have to rely on dragging him out, because that means Embiid needs to take and make a lot of threes. I'm more progressive on that front than many of you, but you want Embiid around the basket as much as possible. So what do you do?\nKeep Embiid moving\nThe simplest approach is to simply work around this. Much like the Ben Simmons vs. Kawhi Leonard issue, you're not going to solve this by trying to barrel through it. Luckily, the Sixers have already incorporated some of the plays they'll need to in order to navigate around Gasol.\nGetting the ball to Embiid on the move has been a struggle for the Sixers for years, and part of that is tied to how he wants to play. Embiid doesn't want to be relegated to a mere roll man on offense, nor should he. But his aversion to those sets cuts down your options.\nBut if Embiid takes the initiative to turn sagging off of him on the perimeter around on an opponent, he becomes dangerous. Late in the Brooklyn series, we saw him take the initiative as a cutter away from the ball, and nobody really wants to get in the way of Embiid if he comes through the lane with force.\nGranted, I would expect Gasol to be a little more attentive than Allen was on these plays, and Toronto's help defense is on another level than Brooklyn's if indeed Gasol screws up.\nThe Sixers have also done a better job of designing lobs for Embiid in recent months, a product of the time Embiid and Simmons have spent on the floor together the last couple months. Simmons' passing is high level, so he can hit the big man at the perfect time when he goes up to flush the ball.\nAs Brown pointed out, you might not be able to have JJ Redick just dump the ball into the post. But you can use the threat of Redick's shooting to help out Embiid. With the Nets top locking Redick to try to prevent him from reaching the perimeter, the Sixers had him run his own man into Embiid's guy, effectively screening two players at once to clear the lane.\nYou're not going to eliminate post-ups or face-up jumpers altogether for Embiid. But the Sixers will need to sprinkle in different looks to keep Gasol guessing, and to take some of the burden off of Embiid in a tough matchup.\nFollow Kyle on Twitter: @KyleNeubeck\nLike us on Facebook: PhillyVoice Sports",

    "https://thehill.com/opinion/cybersecurity/390601-north-koreas-nuclear-threat-is-nothing-compared-to-its-cyber-warfare/": "A nuclear attack against the United States by North Korea would be \u201cone and done\u201d, while a cyber attack by North Korea is the gift that keeps on giving for Kim Jong Un. The former was never really a reality in our lifetime. But the latter is happening even as both nations prepare for the June 12 summit in Singapore.\nThe lack of a specific doctrine in cyber warfare has plagued policymakers for years. In April, President Trump finally sent a report to Congress on U.S. policy for deterring and responding to attacks in the fifth domain \u2014 cyberspace. We\u2019ve had a nuclear doctrine for decades, and now our cyber warfare doctrine is starting to evolve and mature.\n{mosads}So where does that put us with North Korea? It puts us negotiating away a threat that was still years away from becoming a reality, and not dealing with the threat that is staring us in our digital face. After all, there\u2019s little chance the hacking activities of North Korea will be up for discussion.\nInternational sanctions have severely crippled North Korea, making offensive cyber operations against financial institutions a necessary activity to generate much-needed cash. Even as both sides prepare for the summit in Singapore, North Korea continues to target banks in Latin America and Asia with ongoing attacks.\nThe nuclear ambitions of North Korea can be traced back to the early 1950\u2019s. Yet, it took until 2006 before Pyongyang announced their first underground nuclear explosion. Contrast that with the 2014 Sony attack by North Korea, and their quick evolution into a major threat in cyberspace.\nHad North Korea actually launched a nuclear missile, the military response would have been swift and deadly for Kim Jong Un. Instead, through cyberspace, North Korea can attack nations at-will with little chance of real penalty.\nIn 2017, North Korea\u2019s reported WannaCry ransomware attack targeted hospitals, banks and scores of companies. The scope of the attack was made possible by our own National Security Agency (NSA) when a highly classified toolkit of vulnerabilities was compromised. Over 300,00 computers in 150 countries were infected. In the United Kingdom many hospitals were hard hit, causing thousands of appointments and surgeries to be rescheduled.\nThe only punishment? White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert said \u201cI hope they stop acting badly online. If they don\u2019t, this president will act on behalf of the United States.\u201d Ouch \u2026 Kim Jong Un must still be smarting from that tremendous rebuke.\nNorth Korea\u2019s offensive cyber operations will be the ultimate bargaining chip. The prospect of peace, ending a 65-year-old war and the de-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula give Kim Jong Un the advantage for the foreseeable future.\nThis advantage translates into a growing sophisticated malware threat that targets media, aerospace, financial and critical infrastructure organizations, both in the U.S. and globally. As recently as May 29, the FBI and DHS jointly issued an alert that details two families of malware tied to North Korea. Code-named HIDDEN COBRA, this hacking group has kept the intelligence, defense and cybersecurity community just as busy as China, Russia and Iran have.\nMSNBC and Joy Reid apologize for old blog posts but avoid hacking claimhttps://t.co/egw5UjI7g5 pic.twitter.com/Sjcfcv3rJM \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) June 1, 2018\nTrend Micro, a Japan-based security firm, released an analysis in January 2018 on the Lazarus Group \u2014 a.k.a. HIDDEN COBRA. They concluded:\n\u201cFew cybercrime groups throughout history have had as much disruptive power and lasting impact as the Lazarus Group.\u201d\nCyber warfare levels the global playing field in a way nuclear weapons can\u2019t for North Korea. The risk-return calculation for hacking versus nukes is exponentially different. With the advent of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and the relative anonymity that is inherent in the design, North Korea has been able to focus fewer resources to achieve bigger returns than a nuclear program ever could.\nFrom Bitcoin mining to outright theft, North Korea is estimated to have made as much as $200 million last year from cryptocurrency. This allows the country to blunt the effects of U.S. sanctions, and continue funding critical nuclear research \u2014 for now. Imagine what their capability will be when they can double, triple and even decuple their spending. (I had to look it up too. That\u2019s a tenfold increase.)\nNothing is off-limits for North Korea and their continued maturation as a sophisticated cyber threat.\nIn addition to HIDDEN COBRA, North Korea has spinoff groups that focus on specific kinds of targets and attacks. Their activity has been traced back to 2007 and includes a 2016 attack against a bank in Bangladesh that netted $81 million by compromising the bank\u2019s system to obtain its credentials to then send messages on the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) network. Had it not been for some unforced errors, North Korea might have stolen an additional $850 million.\nBusiness is booming, and North Korea is branching out into mobile devices.\nTo take one example, the Lazarus Group created a fake copy of a legitimate Bible reading app in Korean. This Android app \u2014 really a mobile malware attack \u2014 was available from Google Play and was targeted at users in South Korea.\n\u201cCongress is clueless about Facebook \u2014 and that should make us panic\u201d https://t.co/kIKDuaYcQX pic.twitter.com/WlOUmxZvdI \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) April 12, 2018\nWhen Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress on Russian activities during the 2016 election, much attention was paid to the fake profiles created on the Facebook platform. Nothing was mentioned about North Korea, Lazarus, HIDDEN COBRA, or Kim Jong Un and their fake profile campaigns.\nIf North Korea can be this effective in cyberspace, imagine what they will be capable of five years from now. Sticking our heads in the sand about North Korea and their offensive cyber capabilities, only to get the \u201cdeal\u201d done, is denial.\nGavin De Becker in his book \u201cThe Gift of Fear\u201d called denial a \u201csave-now-pay-later\u201d scheme. I can only imagine Kim Jong Un remarking to his band of sycophants, \u201cAnd to think they were worried about our nukes.\u201d\nMorgan Wright is an expert on cybersecurity strategy, cyberterrorism, identity theft and privacy.

Musk and Tesla were also fined $20 million each.\nMusk responded to SEC\u2019s request Monday by saying that the agency had failed to read Tesla\u2019s annual reports.\n\u201cSEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states 350k to 500k.

Republicans have a slim 11-10 majority in the Judiciary Committee, and multiple Democrats have already vowed to vote against moving forward following Ford\u2019s accusation. Ford in the Post article accused Kavanaugh of attempted sexual assault in the early 1980s, when they were students at neighboring high schools in the Washington, D.C., area. She said Kavanaugh held her down and attempted to take off her clothes at a party, at one point holding his hand over her mouth to prevent her from screaming. In the article, she said the incident has haunted her for decades and provided notes from therapy sessions with her husband in which she details what happened. The White House and Kavanaugh have denied the accusations. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on Sunday also voiced willingness to allow Ford to testify before the Judiciary Committee.",

That\u2019s mixed waste,\u201d she told Al Jazeera.\nDe Leon said that while some details around the way the waste was shipped remain unanswered, the rubbish should never have ended up in the Philippines in the first place.\n\u201cIt should have been managed and disposed of safely here in our own country, within our own boundaries,\u201d she said.\nThe case also raises questions, De Leon added, about whether the United Nations convention that governs shipments of hazardous materials between countries needs to be reviewed.\nUN convention\nThat framework is known as the Basel Convention.\n190419061221378\nAn international treaty that sets out regulations for transnational transfers, and the disposal, of hazardous materials, the Basel Convention is central to what\u2019s happening in the Philippines.\nEntering into force in 1992 and ratified by 187 parties, including Canada and the Philippines, the convention outlines rules around what constitutes hazardous material, how shipments must be labelled, what documentation is needed, and the informed consent of countries taking in the waste.\nThe company that sent the rubbish to the Philippines first said it was recyclable plastic, but upon inspection, it turned out to be household waste, said Anthony Ho, a lawyer at the Pacific Centre for Environmental Law and Litigation in British Columbia.\n\u201cThe Philippine authorities did not give consent to this Canadian exporter to be shipping household garbage\u201d and therefore, \u201cthose shipments are considered illegal traffic under the Basel Convention\u201d, Ho told Al Jazeera.\nIt\u2019s, therefore, clear that Canada violated the convention, Ho said.\nHe said the treaty places the onus on the Canadian government to ensure illegal shipments are brought back to Canada within 30 days from when it was first notified of the exports.\nWhile the Philippines told Canada in March 2014 about the waste, Ottawa had argued that it did not have the legal provisions to bring it back, Ho said.\nPreviously, Canadian law did not classify household waste as a hazardous material, and the government also said it did not have a way to pursue a company that was accused of an illegal transfer\n190420120056147\nOttawa passed legislative amendments to address these loopholes in 2016, Ho explained, and he said the Canadian government now \u201chas the legislative tools it needs\u201d.\n\u201cIf, at the end of the day, the state of export can\u2019t compel the company to ship back the waste, the obligation rests ultimately on the government in question to ensure that the waste is transferred back for proper disposal,\u201d he said.\nNonetheless, \u201cthe key enforcement mechanism,\u201d Ho added, \u201cis really political will and pressure.\u201d\nCanada \u2018committed\u2019 to solution\nThe Canadian government so far has taken no concrete steps to bring the waste back to Canada.\nDuring a visit to the Philippines in 2017 to attend that year\u2019s ASEAN Summit, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said it was \u201ctheoretically possible to get [the garbage] back\u201d.\nTrudeau said, however, that Canada and the Philippines were still in discussions about how to deal with the issue, Filipino news outlet Rappler reported at the time.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a number of questions around who would pay for it, where the financial responsibility is. This was at its origin a commercial transaction. It did not involve government,\u201d Trudeau said.\nBut Lucero said that while many people in the Philippines took the Canadian prime minister\u2019s words as a hopeful sign that things would soon be resolved, they have since been let down.\n190419130309991\n\u201cIt is really frustrating for the Filipino people \u2026 It seems that they just issued those promises to silence us,\u201d Lucero said.\n\u201cWe need to have accurate and concrete timeline this time, not just a promise that they will take back. What we are asking them is when? When are you going to take back [the waste]? It should be as immediately as possible.\u201d\nThis week, a spokesperson for Canada\u2019s environment minister told Al Jazeera that Ottawa \u201cis strongly committed to collaborating with the Philippines government to resolve this issue\u201d.\nIn an emailed statement on Wednesday, Sabrina Kim said a joint working group \u201cconsisting of officials from both countries\u201d is looking into the issues, \u201cwith a view to a timely resolution\u201d.\nKim did not specify when a decision was expected, however, but added that Canada\u2019s 2016 amendments to regulations around shipping hazardous waste aimed \u201cto prevent such events from happening again\u201d.\n\u2018A critical moment\u2019\nKathleen Ruff, director of RightOnCanada.ca, a human rights advocacy group in Canada, said words are not enough, however. \u201cIt\u2019s time to take action,\u201d she told Al Jazeera. \u201cThe question that comes up is \u2026 if Canada thumbs its nose at the law, why should any country obey international environmental law? It\u2019s sending a terrible message \u2026 and it\u2019s treating [people in] developing countries as second-class citizens.\u201d\nStill, Ruff said there is reason for optimism, pointing to comments Canada\u2019s ambassador to the Philippines, John Holmes, made this week.\nHolmes told Filipino news outlet ABS-CBN on Wednesday that Trudeau \u201ccommitted and has recommitted to resolving this issue, including taking the waste back to Canada\u201d.\nRuff also said a meeting next week in Geneva that will bring all the parties of the Basel Convention together is an important chance to strengthen global environmental protections.\nShe said two measures that are expected to be voted on may usher in important reforms.\n190403155450092\nThe first proposal, put forward by Norway, would outlaw exports of plastic waste, and the other would ban waste exports to developing countries, she explained.\n\u201cIt is a serious global problem \u2026 We know that if you can just dump your waste, then there\u2019s no incentive to lessen the amount of waste you produce because you can just make them disappear,\u201d Ruff said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very critical moment.\u201d",

    "https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2018/8/16/aretha-louise-franklin-dies-at-the-age-of-76": "The \u2018Queen of Soul\u2019 and first woman inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame passed away from pancreatic cancer.\nThe \u201cQueen of Soul\u201d, Aretha Louise Franklin, has died at the age of 76, according to her representative.\nThe US cultural icon, known for her signature song \u201cRespect\u201d and others, including \u201cThink\u201d and \u201cI Say a Little Prayer\u201d, passed away on Thursday at 9:50am local time from advanced pancreatic cancer in Detroit, Michigan, publicist Gwendolyn Quinn told the Associated Press.\n\u201cIn one of the darkest moments of our lives, we are not able to find the appropriate words to express the pain in our heart,\u201d Franklin\u2019s family said in a statement, according to the Associated Press. \u201cWe have lost the matriarch and rock of our family,\u201d the statement added.\n\u201cWe have been deeply touched by the incredible outpouring of love and support we have received from close friends, supporters and fans all around the world. Thank you for your compassion and prayers. We have felt your love for Aretha and it brings us comfort to know that her legacy will live on.\u201d\nFuneral arrangements will be announced in the coming days, her publicist said.\nFranklin was the high school dropout whose voice graced Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s memorial service, serenaded three presidents and was deemed so precious that it was declared a natural resource in the state of Michigan.\nShe won 18 Grammys and had some 25 gold records in her decades-long career that started when she was just 14 years old.\nTeenage debut\nFranklin was born in the US city of Memphis, Tennessee, to gospel singer parents Clarence and Barbara on March 25, 1942. She was one of five siblings.\nClarence, a reverend, was largely responsible for raising her after separating from Franklin\u2019s mother in 1948 and relocating the family to the city of Detroit, Michigan.\nFour years later, her mother died of a heart attack on March 7, 1952, fewer than three weeks before Franklin\u2019s tenth birthday.\nBut tragedy would not derail her, and by 1954 Franklin had made her debut singing appearance aged 14 at her father\u2019s place of worship, the New Bethel Baptist Church in Detroit.\nThe performance would mark the beginning of a career which would go on to stretch across seven decades and see her gain both domestic and international acclaim, including becoming the first woman to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987.\nNotable hits included \u201cRespect\u201d, \u201c(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\u201d and \u201cI Say A Little Prayer\u201d.\nPresidential acclaim\nThe plaudits of her work weren\u2019t only from within the music industry, however, and in 2005 Franklin was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by then-US President George W Bush.\nShe was connected to several holders of the US\u2019 highest political office, having performed at an inauguration gala for Jimmy Carter in 1977 and both Bill Clinton\u2019s and Barack Obama\u2019s first inaugurations in 1993 and 2009 respectively.\nWith Obama, in particular, Franklin shared a special bond. Her performance at a concert in Washington, DC, in November 2015 famously prompted the US\u2019 first black president to shed a tear, some seven years after Obama, then a senator, recited part of a Franklin song at a Labor Day event in her home city of Detroit.\nHe was, perhaps, her highest profile fan but was only one of many to be moved by her rare, four-octave ranging, voice.\nFranklin\u2019s talent brought her into contact with a number of other international figures as well, most notably in 2015 when she performed for Pope Francis during his September visit to the US.\nYears in the limelight had dimmed her capacity to be overawed though, it appeared. Prior to the concert, Franklin told the New York Times she wouldn\u2019t be fazed by performing for the head of the Catholic Church.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say anyone makes me nervous \u2013 just a tiny butterfly here and there,\u201d she said.\nA force of nature\nHer effect on others, however, could be quite the opposite.\nOn occasions, she would resemble something akin to a force of nature to those who found themselves on the wrong side of musical royalty.\nIn his controversial 2014 biography of Franklin, \u201cRespect\u201d, noted writer David Ritz alleged the Queen of Soul was notorious on the entertainment circuit for cancelling concerts at the last minute, showing up late for performances and belittling contemporaries in the industry, as well as starting feuds with members of her own family.\nFranklin denounced Ritz\u2019s portrayal as false, suggesting the biographer had produced a \u201cvindictive\u201d book because the pair fell out during while working together on her official autobiography 15 years before.\nAmid the allegations and denials, however, the esteem in which the generations of artists who followed Franklin held her was without doubt.\nFrom Beyonce to Mary J Blige and Amy Winehouse to Florence Welch, her work informed and inspired, in particular, a number of female musicians performing across different genres and decades.\nShe was, as Rolling Stone Magazine said in 2008 when it named her the greatest singer of all time, the \u201creason why women want to sing\u201d.\nRecent retirement\nIn more recent years, Franklin battled against prolonged periods of ill-health, prompting her to announce a plan for retirement in early 2017.\nHer final appearance came in November at a charity gala in New York City, organised by fellow singer Elton John, where she closed the event with a rendition of classics including \u201cI Say a Little Prayer\u201d and \u201cFreeway\u201d.\nAmid decades of stardom, Franklin was conspicuously tight-lipped about her personal life. She was married and divorced twice but said little publicly about either relationship.\nForays into politics and other aspects of public life were also rare. But her seminal cover of Otis Redding\u2019s hit, \u201cRespect\u201d, served as something of a rallying cry for the civil and women\u2019s rights movements throughout the late 1960s and beyond.\n\u201cR-E-S-P-E-C-T, find out what it means to me,\u201d she sang.\nPeople across the United States and throughout the rest of the world, enraptured by her talent, listened and demanded the same.\nFranklin is survived by her four sons, Clarence, Edward, Ted and Kecalf.",
    "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/2/26/irans-foreign-minister-javad-zarif-resigns": "A key player in the Iranian government for years, Javad Zarif announced he\u2019s stepping down as foreign minister.\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif stepped down on Monday, announcing his resignation on Instagram.\n\u201cI am apologising you for all the shortcomings \u2026 in the past years during my time as foreign minister \u2026 I thank the Iranian nation and officials,\u201d he wrote on his Instagram page.\nThere was no immediate reason giving for the resignation, which can only take effect if President Hassan Rouhani accepts it.\nIran\u2019s state-run IRNA news agency cited a spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, confirming Zarif had resigned.\nZarif was appointed minister of foreign affairs in August 2013, two years before Iran agreed to scale back its uranium enrichment programme and pledged not to develop nuclear weapons in return for the lifting of international sanctions as part of a landmark nuclear deal brokered with the United States, the UK, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union.\nA vocal supporter of the deal, Zarif has since come under pressure from more hardline power blocs within the Islamic Republic who were opposed to the agreement, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).\nCriticism of the accord has become more intense in recent months following US President Donald Trump\u2019s decision in May 2018 to withdraw from the deal and reimpose sanctions on Tehran.\nTrump\u2019s decision prompted Iran\u2019s currency, the rial, to plunge, prompting sporadic nationwide protests.\nVisibly frustrated\nHassan Abbasi, a retired general in Iran\u2019s hardline Revolutionary Guard, gave a speech earlier this month saying he believed Iranian people would spit on Zarif and other Iranian officials \u2013 including President Hassan Rouhani and member of parliament Ali Larijani \u2013 who backed the nuclear deal.\n\u201cMr Hassan Rouhani, Mr Zarif and Mr Larijani, go to hell,\u201d Abbasi said at a demonstration in the Iranian city of Karaj.\nA staunch Rouhani ally, Zarif \u2013 normally collected \u2013 appeared visibly frustrated at times during a recent security conference in Munich.\nAlready lashed by criticism over the collapsing nuclear deal and renewed tensions with the US, Rouhani faces anger from religious leaders, hardline forces and an ever-growing disaffected public.\nRouhani is particularly vulnerable because of the economic crisis affecting the country\u2019s currency, which has hurt ordinary Iranians and emboldened critics to openly call for his removal.\nThe president secured the 2015 nuclear deal after two years in office and won the praise of Iranians, who flooded the streets to celebrate it. Under the agreement, Iran limited its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.\nBut the benefits of the deal never reached much of the Iranian public. Even before Trump pulled out from the accord, uncertainty over its future caused the rial to plummet.\n\u2018Big blow\u2019\nTara Kangarlou, a fellow at East West Institute, called Zarif\u2019s resignation \u201ca big blow\u201d to Rouhani.\n\u201cWithout Zarif, Rouhani has lost his biggest \u201creformist chip\u201d on global stage,\u201d Kangarlou said, adding that a potential \u201chardliner replacement\u201d would \u201ctake Iran back to [former President Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad\u2019s era with Rouhani \u2013 as a reformist president \u2013 pretty much powerless\u201d.\nMehran Haghirian, an Iran analyst and doctorate student of Gulf Studies at Qatar University, said Zarif\u2019s resignation \u2013 if accepted by Rouhani \u2013 would be \u201ca loss for not just Iranian diplomacy but for those in the international community who seek peace and global stability\u201d.\n\u201cZarif\u2019s positive and successful approach to diplomacy was clearly a nuisance for those who were seeking the continuation of Iran\u2019s isolation since 2013,\u201d he said, citing the likes of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, US National Security Adviser John Bolton and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, among others.\nWe note @JZarif\u2019s resignation. We\u2019ll see if it sticks. Either way, he and @HassanRouhani are just front men for a corrupt religious mafia. We know @khamenei_ir makes all final decisions. Our policy is unchanged\u2014the regime must behave like a normal country and respect its people. \u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) February 26, 2019\nFollowing the resignation, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Zarif is \u201cone of the \u201cfront men for a corrupt religious mafia\u201d.\n\u201cWe note @JZarif\u2019s resignation. We\u2019ll see if it sticks,\u201d Pompeo wrote on Twitter.\nAdditional reporting by Ted Regencia",

Perhaps due from the limited requirements of his past gigs helming the often hilarious but plotless Jackass movies, Tremaine delivers set-ups in The Dirt, but no actual story besides an elongated Behind The Music.\nThe fact is Nikki Sixx, Tommy Lee, ankylosing spondylitis suffering Mick Mars and Vince Neil deserved better. On board as producers, the battle-scarred bass player, drummer, guitarist and singer have earned a movie that confessionally puts it all out there, like their book.\nObviously, they didn\u2019t get it here.\nMaybe it\u2019s because versions of the best-selling oral history from the often tragically imbibing or imploding Sunset Strip band and Neil Strauss having passed through many hands and rights holders over the years. A process that seems to, like the drugs sold outside at Cr\u00fce shows back in the 80s, inevitably have stomped the kick out of the whole thing.\nThe slouching result of this Machine Gun Kelly, Daniel Webber, Douglas Booth and Game of Thrones alum Iwan Rheon starrer is more 2001\u2019s sad Rockstar featuring Marky Mark Wahlberg. That\u2019s a long-lost way in the tall grass from the arrogant abandon of Michael Winterbottom\u2019s 24 Hour Party People from 2002 \u2013 a more obvious blueprint, if you know what I mean?\nWith the exception of a mainly POV montage detailing a day on tour for Roadies vet Kelly portrayed Lee, which starts off with the drummer handcuffed to the bed, most of The Dirt is bleached pretty clean from its feral and self-admitted sordid source material. Yes, there is Vince Neil\u2019s drunken 1984 car crash that killed Hanoi Rocks drummer Razzle and the deeply moving death of the singer\u2019s young daughter from cancer.\nThose are, however, rare exceptions in this straight to MOR movie that has a limited emotional range outside of party time.\nEither in the interest of brevity, legal deniability in the #metoo era or being designated as violent pornography, the Tom Kapinos and Amanda Adelson penned script tosses out the truly terrible things and the interesting things that M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce did all those decades ago. The corporate climate seems to be having settled on reducing the tale of The Dirt to mainly a mere collection of drunken shenanigans and an overdose or three.\nAs well, entertaining intersections in the book with big names and other bands, that don\u2019t involve licking up urine with Ozzy Osbourne, are absent from the flick. So is at least one manager, Mel Gibson, and several wives, including Pamela Anderson.\nAlong with carving off all the messy or convoluted bits as authorized band biographies like Bohemian Rhapsody and Straight Outta Compton have done in recent years too, The Dirt is also oddly overly lite and visually flat. A truly bizarre prospect when you consider that darkly and deeply talented Get Out cinematographer Toby Oliver was behind the lens here \u2013 and how great that Jordon Peele directed Oscar winner looked.\nHaving seen the band at its peak on the Dr. Feelgood tour and a few more times since, it was always clear the Cr\u00fce was never a great band despite having some great tunes. However, what they were extremely entertaining at, even from the cheap seats. was being bad \u2013 which, sadly, is what The Dirt the movie is in all the wrong ways.",

One barge capsized. The other was damaged and leaked the product into the water. Both were carrying about 25,000 barrels of reformate.\nThe Houston Ship Channel was closed from Light 61 to Light 75.\nOfficials initially said about 25,000 barrels of reformate entered the water, but later said they were not sure how much was released.\nReformate is a refined product that is blended with gasoline to boost octane to achieve levels needed for commercial sales. It is an extremely flammable liquid and vapor and can be fatal if it is swallowed. Reformate is toxic to marine life.\nThe name of the 755-foot tanker that struck the barges was Genesis River and it was headed to Bayport Container Dock No. 5, officials said.\nFriendswood dispatch reported receiving several calls related to a smell of gasoline within the city.

When the two were on their feet, Page was the slightly more effective striker, and he won by unanimous decision (48-47 on all three judges' scorecards) at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn., early Sunday. (Sporting News scored the fight 48-47 for Page as well).\nWith the victory, Page advances to the Bellator Welterweight Grand Prix semifinals, where he'll face former champion Douglas Lima at Bellator 221 on May 11 at the Allstate Arena outside Chicago.\nYou could feel the tension when Page and Daley were making their walks into the cage. It intensified when the referee gave his instructions and both fighters had to be held back by security.\nThe first round had the crowd loudly booing the unexpected lack of action. Page threw very little and Daley circled the cage the entire five minutes, throwing almost nothing. That should have been a precursor to expecting the unexpected in what wound up being a not-as-advertised grudge match.\nJoin DAZN and watch MVP-Daley full replay and highlights\nDaley controlled the second and third rounds with his ground attack, taking Page down a couple different ways including a great trip takedown. Daley didn't just smother Page; he attacked the body and the head and made Page work in trying to get up. When Page did get back to his feet, Daley made him with pay with hard shots including a left hook that stunned Page at the end of the second.\nRealizing he was likely down on the scorecards, Page used Daley's trick against him in the fourth round and took him down to the canvas.\nWith the fight hanging in the balance and a berth in the semifinals on the line, Daley looked to be on his way to the Windy City when he secured another takedown. The tide shifted and Page secured the win as he stuffed a Daley takedown attempt and notched a takedown of his own.\nThis is the type of fight Page needed. He had beaten questionable competition previously and Daley was his toughest test to date. The 31-year-old showed a lot of mettle, demonstrating that he can adapt on the fly and do what is necessary to win.\nThat being said, Page also showed holes in his game. Don't think Lima wasn't paying attention and not taking intel.\nHere is what happened at Bellator 216 (all times Eastern):\nBellator 216 results\nMichael Page wins narrow decision over Paul Daley\n12:52 a.m.: Page def. Daley by unanimous decision (48-47, 48-47, 48-47) to advance to the semifinals of the Bellator Welterweight Grand Prix. In what ended up being a wrestling match, the fight came down to the fifth round and Page used his wrestling to secure the win to face Douglas Lima on May 11.\nRound 5 to Page (10-9, 48-47 Page): It appeared that Daley was on his way to victory after he scored another takedown early in the round. Page got up and Daley immediately tried for another one. But Page blocked the attempt and threw a couple elbows and reversed Daley over for a takedown and went to work from there. The judges scoring has been sketchy and this should be no different.\nRound 4 to Page (10-9, 38-38): Page flipped the script on Daley with about a minute to go and notched a takedown of his own. It all comes down to the fifth and final round. Who wants it more?\nRound 3 to Daley (10-9, 29-28 Daley): How many had this one going to the fourth round? Page started well by connecting with a straight right hand. A beautiful trip takedown turned the round around for Daley. He was able to create some space and landed some hard shots. A smart game plan by Daley. Page needs to be able to stuff a couple takedowns to make Daley try to strike with him.\nRound 2 to Daley (10-9, 19-19): Daley showed what his game plan was going to be. He attempted one takedown and missed. Moments later, he was able to secure the takedown. Once he had Page there, he connected on a short elbows to the head and body shots. Like what Daley did there when Page got back to his feet. He threw a right and connected on the left to stagger Page. If Daley can continue this attack, then it's his fight to lose.\nRound 1 to Page (10-9): Not the round fans were expecting, but one that made sense. Each guy was waiting for the other to throw first, so the other could counter. Daley didn't connect on anything, while Page threw a couple shots to at least win the round. Expect both Page and Daley to open up more in the second.\n12:12 a.m.: It is now time for the main event of Bellator 216, as British rivals Michael Page and Paul Daley battle in the first round of the Bellator Welterweight Grand Prix.\nPage (13-0) is one of the most exciting fighters in the sport. All but two of his victories have come by the way of stoppage, including one of the most violent knockouts you will ever see when a flying knee caused a fractured skull to Evangelista \u201cCyborg\u201d Santos at Bellator 158.\nDaley (40-16-2) has won 30 of his fights by knockout, including a vicious KO in a comeback win over Lorenz Larkin at Bellator 183. \"Semtex\" looks to get back on the winning track after losing to Jon Fitch by unanimous decision at Bellator 199.\nThis is Page's biggest test of his career? Can he live up to the hype? Does Daley finally earn the signature win he desperately needs?\nThey don't like each other and will be looking to knock each other's block off. Should be all types of fun.\nJoin DAZN and watch more than 100 fight nights a year\nMirko Cro Cop outstrikes Roy Nelson to win Bellator debut\n12:03 a.m.: Cro Cop def. Nelson by unanimous decision (30-27, 29-28, 29-28). Except for the 30-27 score, this decision wasn't as bad as what we saw in the previous bout. The opening two rounds were extremely close and could have went either way, as Nelson clearly won the third round. While he doesn't have the full snap of his strikes like he did 10 years ago, Cro Cop's striking is still precise when he chooses to throw and it netted him his first victory in Bellator.\nI get Nelson being upset, but not shaking Cro Cop's hand shows bad sportsmanship. It's not Cro Cop's fault the judges scored the fight the way they did, but it wasn't like Nelson clearly won the first or second round.\nHave to wonder if Cro Cop will fight in Bellator again. I'd be interested in Cro Cop-Fedor one more time.\nRound 3 to Nelson (10-9, 29-28 Nelson): The continuous efforts of trying to take Cro Cop down to the mat finally came to the fruition in the final minute when Nelson slammed him down to the ground.\nExpect these scores from the judges to be all over the place considering what has happened so far.\nRound 2 to Nelson (10-9, 19-19): Extremely hard round to score. Cro Cop and Nelson had their share of moments. Nelson was more active in trying for takedowns and landed the harder shots.\nRound 1 to Cro Cop (10-9): Who would have thought a second round would be upon us? Nelson was controlling more of the cage, but Cro Cop landed the harder shots. He connected on some vicious knees and short uppercuts in the clinch.\n11:40 p.m.: It is now time for the co-main event of Bellator 216, as Roy Nelson goes up against Mirko Cro Cop in heavyweight action. Nelson and Cro Cop met at UFC 137 back in October 2011 with the former winning by third-round TKO.\nNelson (23-16) has lost three of his last four fights including his last two. Cro Cop (37-11-2) is on an incredible run at the age of 44, as he\u2019s on a nine-fight winning streak. Cro Cop\u2019s last 20 victories have come by stoppage.\nDon\u2019t blink because this won\u2019t last long.\nChecik Kongo wins puzzling decision over Vitaly Minakov\n11:30 p.m.: Kongo def. Minakov by unanimous decision (30-27, 29-28, 29-28). That is one of the most baffling decisions I've seen in a very long time. Minakov dominated the majority of the fight, while Kongo fought in very short spurts at the end of the second and especially the third round, where Minakov scored a takedown and dominated the action on the ground. In the final 30 seconds, Kongo got to his feet and landed a series of knees, a right hand and an uppercut before the final horn sounded.\nWins should be earned by competing the entire time and not in final moments of rounds. A shame the judges only looked at those moments and not the totality of it all. Look at when the ring announcer read the final scorecard, Kongo couldn't believe he won, which is the biggest indicator of knowing you lost.\nThis shouldn't earn Kongo a title opportunity at heavyweight champion Ryan Bader. A performance like that isn't going to make people want to watch or pay for the bout.\n11:17 p.m.: For about four minutes in the second round, that was one of the worst rounds in the history of the sport. Literally nothing happened. Kongo and Minakov need to let loose in the third round. The winner of the third round is likely to net the victory.\n11:04 p.m: Coming up next at Bellator 216, Vitaly Minakov and Cheick Kongo meet in heavyweight action. Kongo (29-10-2) has seen a career resurgence in winning seven consecutive fights. Minakov (21-0), a former Bellator heavyweight champion, returns to the promotion for the first time since he and Kongo fought in April 2014 at Bellator 115. Minakov got stripped of the belt due to inactivity because of a dispute with the promotion.\nDoes Kongo make the proper adjustments the second time around? Can Minakov show the American audience how much he\u2019s improved since the last time he fought in the States?\nYaroslav Amosov outwrestles Erick Silva to earn decision victory\n10:55 p.m.: Amosov def. Silva by unanimous decision (29-27, 29-28, 29-28). Not the most crowd-pleasing win, but it got the job done. Silva had a great first round as he was able to keep the fight on the feet and even bloodied Amosov. But in the second round, Amosov went with his bread and butter \u2014 his wrestling. Amosov scored one takedown after another. When he had Silva on the mat, he smothered him and kept landing short shots to get the victory.\nAmosov remains undefeated and could be the dark horse in a crowded welterweight division.\n10:30 p.m.: Up next at Bellator 216, Erick Silva faces Yaroslav Amosov in welterweight action. Silva (20-9-1 no-contest), making his Bellator debut, snapped a two-fight losing streak in July when he scored a first-round submission over Nick Barnes. Amosov (20-0) had a successful Bellator debut, also in July, dominating Gerald Harris to win a lopsided decision at Bellator 202.\nSilva and Amosov each have 12 finishes in the first round. Expect fireworks early and often.\nValerie Loureda makes quick work of Colby Fletcher\n10:20 p.m.: Valerie Loureda def. Colby Fletcher by TKO at 2:55 of the first round. Couldn't ask for a better debut. Loureda was controlling the fight on the feet when she threw a straight right hand, a left hook right above the eye to stun Fletcher, followed by a body kick to send Fletcher to the mat. Sensing she had Fletcher ripe for the picking, Loureda unloaded a series of hammerfists until referee Kevin McDonald finally stopped the fight.\nThe emotion after the fight is the reason you love MMA. She was crying and her entire team were in tears. It was the first win of what could be many to come.\n10:10 p.m.: Kicking off the main card of Bellator 216, Valerie Loureda takes on Colby Fletcher in women's flyweight action. The 20-year-old Loureda will be making her professional debut and a 4thdan taekwondo black belt. This will be the first time Fletcher (1-2) competes in over three and a half years.\n10:00 p.m. ET: Welcome to Sporting News's live coverage of Bellator 216. A great night of fights slated. Grab the refreshments and sit back because you don't want to miss one moment.\nBellator 216 undercard results\nJustin Sumter def.

The start time for the Monster Energy Open is 6 p.m. ET, and the start time for the All-Star Race itself is 8:30 p.m. ET. The start time for the pre-race show on FS1 is 5 p.m. ET.\nMORE: Watch the NASCAR All-Star Race live with fuboTV (7-day trial)\nThe 6 p.m. ET start time for Saturday's NASCAR Cup races signals the third night race of the 2019 season. As for the TV channel, the NASCAR Cup Series returns to FS1 for the third week in a row. As part of FOX's TV deal with NASCAR for the 2019 season, FOX was slated to show nine Cup races this year, and FS1 was scheduled to show eight, including the All-Star Race.\nSaturday's All-Star Race at Charlotte Motor Speedway, which will consist of four stages (30 laps, 20 laps, 20 laps, 15 laps), is the 13th race on the NASCAR Cup Series schedule, though it is not a point race.

This year's All-Star Race will feature more changes, some that might be implemented in the Generation 7 car that should be in place by 2021.\nHere are the two new rules components for the All-Star Race, from NASCAR's release:\n\"The first is single-piece carbon fiber splitter/pan that should offer dramatic improvements in ride height sensitivity for the drivers. This technical component will provide a more stable aero platform and create more consistent performance in traffic. \"Also, the car will be configured with a radiator duct which exits through the hood as opposed to the current design which exits into the engine compartment. This feature will create improved aerodynamic parity and, at the same time, reduce engine temperatures.\"\nMORE: Full 2019 NASCAR Cup Series schedule\nSo far, 15 drivers have qualified for the All-Star Race by winning a race in 2018 or 2019, being a past All-Star Race winner or being a past NASCAR Cup Series champion. The winners of each of the three stages (20 laps, 20 laps and 10 laps) in the Monster Energy Open race will move into the feature, as will the driver who wins the fan vote.\nFor the first time in his Cup Series career, Chase Elliott earned his spot in the All-Star Race by virtue of race wins and not the fan vote. He won his first, second and third career Cup races last season and already has another victory (Talladega) this season.\nElliott's teammate, Jimmie Johnson, can enter the All-Star Race with high hopes, especially given the unknowns around the new rules package. Johnson has four career All-Star Race wins, the most for any driver.",

James and the Cavs swept the Raptors for the second consecutive year, eliminating them from the postseason for the third straight time.\nYear in and year out, LeBron served as the roadblock preventing the Raptors from reaching new heights in the postseason. That is, until he decided to head West and join the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018.\nWhile last year seemed different, this year is different.\nAside from the fact that it's the first time in four years that the Raptors won't see LeBron in the postseason, this Lakers team is less dangerous than the Cavs of years past, and this Raptors team has added a guy named Kawhi Leonard.\nThe first time these two teams met this season, Toronto dominated Los Angeles 121-107, and Kawhi didn't even suit up; James finished the night with 18 points and six assists in less than 30 minutes of action.\nWhile plenty has changed, LeBron is still LeBron. In a \"down\" year marred by injury, he's averaging 27.3 points, 8.7 rebounds and 8.0 rebounds, but he's in great danger of missing the postseason for the first time since 2005.\nAll things considered, it's fair to question whether or not LeBron's dominance of the Raptors is set to come to an end.\nAs LeBron returns to Canada for the first time since the 2018 postseason, take a look back at some of his defining moments throughout the years at the building formerly known as the Air Canada Centre.\nMar. 20, 2005\nRaptors 105, Cavaliers 98 | 56 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists\nFirst career 50-point performance\nJust 80 days after his 20th birthday, James exploded for 56 points (on 18-for-36 shooting) but the Cavs would ultimately fall to the Raptors.\nJan. 6, 2008\nCavaliers 93, Raptors 90 | 39 points, 11 rebounds, 8 assists\nFourth quarter takeover\nWith his team down 13 points heading into the final frame, King James took over. LeBron scored 24 fourth-quarter points, as the Cavs outscored the Raptors 36-20 to escape the Air Canada Centre with a three-point win.\nFeb. 26, 2010\nCavaliers 126, Raptors 118 (OT) | 36 points, 9 assists, 6 rebounds\nClutch play results in a win\nWith Cleveland down two points, James tied things up with 13.9 seconds remaining in regulation. The Cavs would leave Toronto with an eight-point win, and LeBron scored or assisted on over half of the team's 40 points in the fourth quarter and overtime.\nNov. 5, 2013\nHeat 104, Raptors 95 | 35 points, 8 rebounds, 8 assists\nThe streak reaches a new plateau\nMILESTONE ALERT! @KingJames has now scored 10+ points in 500 consecutive games.

Giannis Antetokounmpo (concussion) and Kawhi Leonard (rest) missed the game, and Milwaukee cruised to a 124-109 win behind a balanced effort that saw seven players score in double figures.\nSerge Ibaka led the Raptors in scoring that night with 30 points and Pascal Siakam chipped in with 22 points.\nThe second meeting was much closer but the end result was the same. Behind a 19-point, 19-rebound double-double from Antetokounmpo, the Bucks defeated the Raptors in Toronto, 104-99.\nKyle Lowry struggled in the loss, going scoreless on 0-for-5 shooting from the field.\nThe Raptors picked up their lone win against the Bucks on Jan. 5 in what turned out to be the best game between the two teams this season. Leonard and Siakam led the Raptors in scoring with 30 points each, but they got a scoring punch out of Ibaka (25), Danny Green (12) and Fred VanVleet (21), the latter of whom started in place of Lowry, who was dealing with a back injury.\nThe five of them helped Toronto overcome 43 points, 18 rebounds and four assists from Antetokounmpo to beat the Bucks, 123-116.\nThe Bucks got some revenge in the final game of the season, winning by a final score of 105-92 at the Scotiabank Arena. It was a team effort once again, as seven players scored in double figures, including D.J. Wilson (16) and George Hill (10) off the bench.\nKey Storyline: Can the Raptors contain Giannis Antetokounmpo?\nThe Raptors will have their hands full trying to slow down Antetokounmpo, who is averaging 27.4 points, 11.4 rebounds and 4.4 assists per game in these playoffs.\nThe Bucks have built a team around Antetokounmpo that plays perfectly to his strengths, surrounding him with shooters to give him the space he needs to attack the paint, where he led the league in scoring this season.\nAntetokounmpo is a matchup nightmare for every team because he's too big and strong for perimeter players to guard and too quick and athletic for big men to stay in front of.\nDouble-teaming him is risky as well. Not only is Antetokounmpo a capable passer, the Bucks made and attempted the second-most 3-pointers in the league this season, trailing only the Houston Rockets. Every player on Milwaukee's roster is comfortable shooting 3-pointers, even Brook Lopez, who set the record for 3s made by a centre during the regular season.\nSo who on the Raptors will take on the responsibility of defending Antetokounmpo? According to NBA.com, Siakam matched up with the MVP candidate the most this season, followed by Leonard, Ibaka and OG Anunoby.\nHere's what Antetokounmpo did in each of those matchups:\nRaptors vs. Antetokounmpo Defender Games Possessions Points FGM-FGA Assists Turnovers Siakam 3 93 41 15-27 5 5 Leonard 3 31 4 2-3 3 0 Ibaka 3 26 14 6-9 0 2 Anunoby 3 24 13 4-5 3 1\nThis is another series where the Raptors will miss Anunoby if he's unable to play. While he wouldn't be the primary defender on Antetokounmpo, Toronto would benefit greatly from having another wing who can match up with him physically, especially now that Siakam is dealing with an injury.\nAccording to Blake Murphy of The Athletic, Anunoby is now travelling with the Raptors for the first time since undergoing an emergency appendectomy, but there's still no update on when he is expected to return.\nThree Players to Watch\nKawhi Leonard\nvs. Milwaukee in 2018-19 (three games): 22.0 points (42.6 FG%, 30.0 3P%, 81.0 FT%), 7.7 rebounds, 4.0 assists\nThe Bucks did a better job defending Leonard this season than most teams, limiting him to 22.0 points per game on 42.6 percent shooting from the field.\nLeonard was fantastic in Toronto's lone win with a team-high 30 points, but he scored a total of 36 points in the two other contests he appeared in.\nKhris Middleton was the primary reason Leonard didn't play to his usual standard. According to NBA.com, he limited the three-time All-Star to 36 points on 11-for-27 shooting from the field over three games.\nAaron Gordon has similar success against Leonard based on the matchup data, but Leonard torched both him and the Magic in the first round to the tune of 27.8 points per game. Will Leonard be able to do the same against a Bucks team that had the best defensive rating in the league this season?\nKhris Middleton\nvs. Toronto in 2018-19 (three games): 14.0 points (47.6 FG%, 42.9 3P%, 63.6 FT%), 6.5 assists, 5.3 rebounds\nThe Bucks will need Middleton to be a star on both ends of the court against the Raptors. In addition to having to defend Leonard, who is in the midst of the best playoff run of his career, they'll need him to be their secondary playmaker.\nHe was just that against the Pistons in the first round and the Celtics in the second round, posting 19.1 points and 4.6 assists per game.\nWhile Middleton failed to score 20 points in any of the Bucks' four meetings with the Raptors, his impact was clearly felt in other aspects of the game, like defence and playmaking. Two of Middleton's three best games as a facilitator came against Toronto as he dished out nine assists in a Jan. 5 loss and eight assists in a win on Oct. 29.\nThe regular seasons suggests that Middleton doesn't necessarily need to be a scorer to help the Bucks advance past the Raptors, but his playmaking abilities can go a long way.\nMarc Gasol\nvs. Milwaukee in 2018-19 (two games): 21.5 points (48.4 FG%, 50.0 3P%, 71.4 FT%), 4.5 rebounds, 3.5 assists\nGasol is a big reason why the Raptors are in the Eastern Conference Finals, but this could be a tough series for him.\nWhereas Nikola Vucevic and Joel Embiid are both back to the basket centres, which better plays to his strengths as a defender, Lopez does most of his scoring from the 3-point line. He attempted 6.3 3-pointers per game this season and shot 36.5 percent from that distance.\nLopez hasn't shot well through two rounds of these playoffs, but having him on the floor will force Gasol to cover far more ground than he did against the Magic and 76ers.\nUnless the Raptors can find a better matchup for Gasol \u2014 perhaps Antetokounmpo, as it would allow him to stay closer to the paint \u2014 Ibaka might Toronto's go-to centre in this series.\nPicks and Predictions\nMicah Adams: Raptors in six\nCarlan Gay: Bucks in six\nKyle Irving: Bucks in six\nGilbert McGregor: Raptors in seven\nAlex Novick: Bucks in seven\nScott Rafferty: Raptors in seven",

Download The Action Network App to get real-time odds and live win probabilities on your bets.\nThe Knights (18-12-1 against the spread) have dropped their past two games ATS after covering in each of their previous eight contests. On the flip side, the Rams (20-11-1 ATS) failed to cover in three of their past five affairs.\nWhich team presents the most value in this Round of 64 matchup? Let\u2019s breakdown the biggest factors.\nHow Healthy is Marcus Evans?\nThe 6-foot-2 guard exited the Rams\u2019 Atlantic 10 tournament quarterfinals (knee injury) and failed to return. Evans isn\u2019t able to simulate game action in practice, but he\u2019s set to give it a go for their contest against the Knights.\nEvans has notched the 23rd-highest steal rate (4.1%) in the country, but it\u2019s unknown how much lateral movement he\u2019ll have at that end of the court.\nWill Tacko Fall 7 Co. Dominate Inside?\nThe Knights\u2019 59th-ranked Adjusted Offensive Efficiency (110.6 points per 100 possessions) stems from their prowess for attacking the rim.\nNot only has Johnny Dawkins\u2019 bunch produced the 79th-highest 2-point clip (52.5%) in college basketball \u2014 led by the 7-foot-6, 310-pound Tacko Fall (10.9 points per game) \u2014 but it has also generated the second-highest free-throw rate (46.4%) in the country.\nUCF point guard B.J. Taylor (16.0 ppg) initiates it all, along with tallying the 31st-highest individual rate in that department.\nVCU has struggled to stay out of foul trouble, especially in A-10 play, allowing the second-highest free-throw rate (37.6%). Overall, Mike Rhoades\u2019 squad has let up the 20th-highest scoring from that vicinity (20.9%).\nThe Rams still possess an advantage in the turnover department, though, even if Evans isn\u2019t as effective as usual. They\u2019ve manufactured the ninth-highest opponents\u2019 turnover rate (23.4%) while the Knight accrued the fifth-highest rate in AAC play. Expect Rhoades\u2019 ball pressure to give UCF issues, particularly when it looks to feed Fall in the low-post.\nCan VCU Succeed in Half-Court Sets?\nThe Rams\u2019 transition offense is electric when they turn their opponents over, utilizing the 40th-highest average possession length (16.1 seconds).\nBut their interior offense has been effective, too, totaling the 52nd-highest 2-point clip (53.7%) in the nation. The 6-foot-7 Marcus Santos-Silva (10.1 ppg) showcased his low-post prowess following Evans\u2019 departure on Friday, going off for a 26-point, 22-rebound performance.\nUCF\u2019s 2-point defense regressed in conference play, yielding the fourth-highest scoring rate (49.4%) to league foes. That\u2019s a product of its inability to control the glass, and VCU owns the 88th-highest offensive rebounding rate (31.1%) in the country.\nExpect the 6-foot-6 Isaac Vaas and the aforementioned Santos-Silva to have a major impact inside the arc, and anything Evans delivers off the dribble is a plus.\nEli\u2019s Pick: VCU +1, but don\u2019t bet it past VCU PK.\nOur Projected Odds: VCU vs. UCF\nGet point spreads for this game and every possible tournament matchup with our bracket simulator built by Sean Koerner, our Director of Predictive Analytics, a former oddsmaker and FantasyPros\u2019 most accurate in-season fantasy football ranker from 2015-2017.\nSpread: UCF -1\nUCF -1 Total: 125.5\n125.5 Proj Score: VCU 62.5 | UCF 63.5\nVCU 62.5 | UCF 63.5 Win Probability: VCU 49.8% | UCF 50.2%",

That means head-to-head and other prop bets for the race weekend are a bit limited.\nAt the time of writing, no prop bets have been posted for the Open, and only head-to-head matchups are currently being offered for the main event.\nThankfully, there are a few good values among those matchup bets. If any other props get added closer to the drop of the green flag for the Open, I\u2019ll be sure to update this post with any additional bets I\u2019m making.\nKurt Busch +135 over Chase Elliott\nI\u2019m not sure why Busch is such a huge dog against Elliott, but Kurt could actually be the favorite when looking at the statistics. Busch has been a model of consistency, posting finishes of third, fifth, ninth and seventh, while Elliott has finishes of 19th, ninth, 13th and fourth over the same four 1.5-mile races in 2019, with no major incidents.\nBut looking beyond average finish, Kurt Busch is severely underrated this weekend. Here\u2019s a table showing how undervalued Busch is:\nWin Rnk: The ordinal ranking based on the current Westgate odds to win (with ties averaged among the drivers).\nThe ordinal ranking based on the current Westgate odds to win (with ties averaged among the drivers). AvgSpd: The average green flag speed ranking from the four 1.5-mile races this year.\nThe average green flag speed ranking from the four 1.5-mile races this year. SpdRnk: The ordinal ranking of AvgSpd for the drivers locked into the main event.\nThe ordinal ranking of AvgSpd for the drivers locked into the main event. Diff: The different between SpdRnk and WinRnk. A positive number means the driver has run better than the odds suggest.\nWe can see from the table that Kurt Busch is the most undervalued driver in the field, while Elliott is slightly overvalued. The elder Busch brother has a 6.75 average green flag speed rank while Elliott comes in at 9.75, yet somehow Busch is the dog.\nBusch also practiced faster than Elliott over 10-consecutive laps in final practice. I think Busch is the clear favorite and I\u2019d bet him down to -120.\nAric Almirola +105 over Erik Jones\nAlmirola has run 14 races at 1.5-mile tracks during his career at Stewart-Haas Racing (SHR). Twelve of those races have been incident-free, in which he\u2019s averaged a 9.25 finish, with a worst finish of 13th.\nAdditionally, in one of the two races he had an incident, he dominated a large portion of the race before a loose wheel took him out of contention. That\u2019s a model of consistency. Jones has also posted excellent finishes, with an average of 7.6 during the same span.\nBut I\u2019m banking on Almirola for a few reasons. Looking at average green flag speed for 2019 at the 1.5-mile tracks, Almirola checks in at 10.5 while Jones is at 12.0. Neither driver has had a major incident in those races, so this is an appropriate comparison.\nReferencing the table above, Almirola comes in as the second-most undervalued driver based on this metric relative to betting odds, while Jones is the third-most overvalued.\nAlmirola also ran 0.9 mph faster than Jones over 10-consecutive laps in final practice. He should be the favorite, not the dog. I\u2019d bet Almirola down to -110.\nBrad Keselowski -160 over Austin Dillon\nIt\u2019s rare I bet such a huge favorite in NASCAR head-to-head matchups, but this is as much of a lock as it gets if luck wasn\u2019t a factor. Of course, luck is a factor, so we need to determine how much randomness is inherent in the All-Star race.\nThe average incident rate at 1.5-mile tracks since 2013 when the Gen-6 car was introduced hovers just below 18%. During this same time frame, the All-Star race has an average incident rate of 16.8%. Certainly the segments will add a small amount of randomness to the process, but that randomness will be reduced a little bit with the final stage coming in at five laps longer than previous years.\nKeselowski should be an exceptionally strong favorite barring a major incident even with the added randomness. The table above says indicates why \u2014 Keselowski\u2019s 8.5-to-17.25 advantage in green flag speed, plus his average finish of 1.3 in his three incident-free 1.5-mile races in 2019 gives him a massive leg up on Dillon, whose best 1.5-mile finish is 14th.\nI\u2019d bet Keselowski down to -190.",

Trotz said this was not just part of trying to ease him back into the lineup, but more that he wanted a penalty killer and so he brought Tom Kuhnhackl into the lineup.\n\u201cWithout [Martin] and [Clutterbuck], we needed a penalty killer,\u201d Trotz said. \u201cLadder has done it in the past, but it\u2019s not there yet at this point.\u201d\nAbout midway through the game, Trotz moved rookie defenseman Devon Toews up to the first pair with Johnny Boychuk and moved the struggling Nick Leddy down with Scott Mayfield.\n\u201cNick\u2019s played a lot of hockey,\u201d Trotz said. \u201cLeds and Johnny were having a few rough games here.

The Players Association also reiterated a long-time request, proposing that the designated hitter be implemented in the National league, too. That move likely would increase offense, but could meet resistance from NL owners, who may not be enthusiastic about paying more for an extra offensive bat.\nThe proposal from the two sides for different ways to improve the game is likely just the beginning with more ideas and trade-offs expected to be discussed in the coming weeks, according to the report.\nIf no deal is reached, however, commissioner Rob Manfred still can make some pace-of play changes.\nThe collective bargaining agreement empowers the commissioner to unilaterally implement three elements he formally proposed last year, according to sources \u2014 a 20-second pitch clock, a reduction of mound visits from six to five and a rule placing a base runner on second base in spring training games and the All-Star Game when the score is tied after the 10th inning.\nThe current proposal by MLB includes a slight tweak from the above provisions, reducing mound visits from six to four in 2019 and four to three in 2020. It also includes an expansion of rosters from 25 to 26 in 2020, with an accompanying reduction from 40 to 28 in September.\nAccording to a previous report by the Associated Press, baseball also has proposed increasing the minimum time a player spends on the disabled list and amount of time an optioned player spends in the minor leagues from 10 to 15 days.\nIf the three-batter minimum rule is approved, it likely would increase the importance of the starting pitcher and also could limit the number of openers \u2014 relievers starting games.",

It's prime time to get struck by a viral or bacterial illness like tonsillitis, which can leave you feeling rotten and out of action for up to a week or two.\nBut if your sore throat is lingering, you may want to pay a little more attention to it.\nNew scientific research led by the University of Exeter and published in the British Journal of General Practice concludes that GPs seeing patients with persistent hoarse throats should consider whether it could be a symptom of something more serious, like laryngeal cancer.\nThe larynx is the part of the throat located at the top of the windpipe, and helps you to breathe and speak.\nThis content is imported from {embed-name}. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\nThe study assessed patients diagnosed with cancer of the larynx alongside a number of control patients, and found that a key symptom was a consistently sore throat - but only when paired with other ailments. Such symptoms include shortness of breath, trouble swallowing and earache.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Cancer Research UK said the information shouldn't scare people, but should inform them about what to pay attention to. \"A sore throat on its own wasn't linked to laryngeal cancer,\" a spokesperson reassured.\nProfessor Willie Hamilton, who co-authored the study, noted that its findings could be important because they indicate \"the potential severity of some symptom combinations previously thought to be low risk.\"\nGetty Images\nAnd he's right. A sore throat or an earache on their own aren't things we'd necessarily panic about - and that should continue to be the case. But if the symptoms persist, and you note they occur in conjunction with one another, it's best to get yourself checked out just in case something more serious could be at plat.\nThe UK sees around 2,000 diagnoses of laryngeal cancer each year, however it's proven to be more common in men. The disease is also thought to have strong links to smoking and drinking alcohol.\nRead more about laryngeal cancer and its symptoms over on Cancer Research's website.\nFollow Cat on Twitter.",

We're putting that down to another Love Island miracle.\nHere's everything we learned ahead of the new series - including a solution to bad weather and a condom count. You're welcome.\n1. Everyone who arrives at the villa must use hand sanitiser\nGiphy\nPassing round a communal hand sanitiser in the coach enforced by security immediately brought us back down to earth as we arrived for our tour of the sprawling villa.\nWe're told it's a precautionary measure to kill all viruses so that the cast and crew don't get ill.\n2. Some lucky cleaner gets to change the bed sheets...\nGiphy\nKeeping it as sexy as the show, the producers informed us that the cleaners come once a week, during which they also change the sheets.

There isn\u2019t a limit to alchohol\nITV2\nThere's been lots of conflicting reports of how much booze is actually permitted in the villa, with Kady telling us last year that they were usually allowed two glasses a night.\nHowever, producers told us that there is no limit, although they do keep an eye on booze intake.\n\"We monitor things,\" a producer explained. \"They can have a drink but we're really careful that they don't have too much. There's no limit... We judge on a case by case basis but we're responsible about it.\"\n4.

This is how many condoms are available to the Islanders\nGiphy\n200. And the branded kind, of course.\n6. It never rains on Love Island\nGiphy\nOr so producers joked. If it does pour down, it's likely they'll edit around the weather and we'll probably see more footage of the Islanders inside the villa.\n7.

A dumped Islander could return a la Muggy Mike\nITV\nWe could see a rejected Islander come back to the show after the sheer brilliance of Mike's unforeseen resurrection.\n\"We only felt comfortable doing that off the back of a public vote,\" a producer explained. \"So we knew that the viewers were happy to endorse it.\"\n9.

Chris Pine most definitely won't be turning up, mind you...\nImeh Akpanudosen Getty Images\nIslander Samira Mighty revealed she went on a date with Chris a couple of years ago and that they're still in touch. So much so the Hollywood actor even asked the West End performer if she was around to hangout this summer.\nSadly, Chris got pied for Love Island.\n\"He texts me now and then, just to let me know he's there,\" she said. \"He was like, 'oh my gosh, I'm here over summer, let's hangout.' But I'm on the show! He would never go on the show! He was like, ahh, 'Ok. I was like, cool'. End of friendship end of convo!\"\nLol\n11. Some of the contestants auditioned, and some were scouted on Instagram\nITV\nA couple of the Islanders applied the usual way by sending a video in, but others were contacted by producers or casting agents to take part via social media.\nModel Hayley Hughes told us: \"[Producers] had contacted me previous years, but I\u2019ve had boyfriends. They contacted me on social media on Instagram.\n\"I was flattered - to be fair, it was a week before closing that they contacted me, so I haven't really had time to think about it.\"\nThey also sometimes find eligible people for the show via their friends and who they\u2019re following on social media.\n12. The casting team meet around 1000 people before they're narrowed down to make the cast\nITV\nAnd the casting team will continue to consider contestants pretty much up until the show ends.\nWe're still in with a chance...\nLove Island begins on Monday 4th June.

Go digital with Squares Pick\u2019em!]\nCoach of the year: Bears coach Matt Nagy\nNagy led the Bears to a surprise NFC North championship, and won coach of the year in his first season as a head coach. Last season he was offensive coordinator of the Chiefs with Andy Reid, and the Bears made a great hire. Nagy\u2019s offensive creativity was on display all season, and the Bears defense was dominant on their way to a 12-4 season. The Bears lost in their first playoff game, but it was still a big growth season for the franchise.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t reach the pinnacle, but that\u2019s going to motivate us when we get together this spring and summer,\u201d Nagy said.\nNagy said he cut short a vacation with his wife to St. Lucia to attend the NFL Honors show.\nComeback player of the year: Colts QB Andrew Luck\nLuck missed all last season after shoulder surgery, but returned in a big way. He threw for 4,593 yards and 39 touchdowns, leading the Colts to an AFC wild-card berth. There were plenty of questions about Luck\u2019s ability to come back and play at his previous level during a long rehab after surgery on his labrum, but he immediately re-established himself as one of the top quarterbacks in the NFL.\n\u201cCertainly this was a rewarding and fulfilling season in many ways,\u201d Luck said. \u201cBeing on the field, trying to do your best, it was freeing, liberating.\nDefensive player of the year: Rams DT Aaron Donald\nDonald winning defensive player of the year was one of the easiest picks of the night. Donald set a record for a defensive tackle with 20.5 sacks this season. He has established himself as the best non-quarterback in the NFL and he has won defensive player of the year two seasons in a row.\nDonald wasn\u2019t able to attend NFL Honors because he and the Rams will be playing in Super Bowl LIII on Sunday.\nDefensive rookie of the year: Colts LB Darius Leonard\nLeonard, a second-round pick, led the NFL with 163 tackles and established himself as the star of the Colts defense in his first season. Leonard also had seven sacks and two interceptions, as he instantly became one of the NFL\u2019s best playmakers. Leonard was an All-Pro pick. He beat out Chargers safety Derwin James, who also was a first-team All-Pro as a rookie.\n\u201cI honestly thought I\u2019d have to take a backseat role, take a year or two to get my feet wet,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cI definitely surprised myself.\u201d\nWalter Payton man of the year: Eagles DE Chris Long\nLong was given the NFL\u2019s award for charity work off the field. Long\u2019s foundation helped to provide clean water to impoverished communities in East Africa through an initiative called \u201cWaterboys.\u201d Last year, Long donated all of his game checks for educational programs in his hometown of Charlottesville, Va. and in St. Louis, Boston and Philadelphia, the three cities in which he has spent his NFL career.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous honor,\u201d Long said. \u201cI\u2019m very humbled.\u201d\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\u2022 Watch Super Bowl LIII live stream free with the Yahoo Sports app\n\u2022 LeBron, Durant wear Kaepernick jerseys ahead of Super Bowl LIII\n\u2022 Lakers reportedly underwhelm Pelicans with initial Davis offer\n\u2022 Patriots\u2019 McCourty twins living out their childhood dream\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports.

Randle\u2019s deal is worth $18 million for two years, according to a report by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski.\nThe news surfaced around 4 p.m. Pacific time and followed an interesting Monday of free agency action. Earlier in the day, former Pelicans point guard Rajon Rondo agreed to sign a one-year, $9 million deal with the Los Angeles Lakers.\nAs it relates to Randle, ESPN\u2019s Wojnarowski reported all-NBA Pelicans forward Anthony Davis played a large part in the recruitment.

    "https://sports.yahoo.com/western-conference-finals-preview-golden-state-warriors-vs-portland-trail-blazers-210245878.html": "The top-seeded Golden State Warriors and third-seeded Portland Trail Blazers disposed of the Houston Rockets and Denver Nuggets in six and seven games, respectively. The two teams will meet for a third time in four years. Golden State beat Portland in a 2017 first-round sweep and a 2016 second-round, five-game set.\nHow they got here\nGolden State: In their quest for a third straight title and fourth in five years, the Warriors lost DeMarcus Cousins to a torn left quad in Game 2 of the first round and Kevin Durant to a right calf strain in Game 5 of the second round. Yet, here we are, with Golden State installed as heavy favorites to beat Portland and become the first team since the Boston Celtics of the 1950s and \u201860s to reach five straight Finals.\nCousins, somehow, is \u201con course\u201d to return during the Western Conference finals, and Durant is scheduled to be re-evaluated this week, when we should know if and when he can play in this series. So, after all the hullabaloo over Durant\u2019s impending free agency and Cousins\u2019 decision to join a team already stacked with four All-Star starters, we are likely left with the Warriors of old for at least the start of this series.\nAre they still good enough with merely three All-NBA talents? They looked the part on Friday, when Splash Brothers Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson combined for 60 points in a close-out win in Houston. The \u201cStrength in Numbers\u201d Warriors were back, with Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston and a cast of late draft picks filling roles around Curry, Thompson and Draymond Green. Andrew Bogut was there, too.\nThere is still some suspense, and that is a good thing. Curry and Thompson both battled cold streaks through two rounds, and Golden State\u2019s depth remains a question, even as 35-year-old Iguodala turns back the clock and backup center Kevon Looney emerges as a real threat. There are concerns about Bogut, Quinn Cook, Alfonzo McKinnie and Jordan Bell, all of whom were called upon in Houston, and Livingston had been largely ineffective until Game 6. If you\u2019re calling for more frontcourt minutes from Jonas Jerebko, you know you\u2019re not completely at ease.\nStory continues\nIf Durant returns by the time this series moves to Portland and is any semblance of himself, that\u2019s a different story. Even as the Warriors went longer than expected in their first-round series with the Los Angeles Clippers and were deadlocked entering Game 5 against the Rockets, the outcomes never really felt in doubt, because Durant was the best player in all the playoffs and nobody had an answer for him.\nStephen Curry has historically been a step ahead of Damian Lillard in the NBA's point guard hierarchy. (Getty Images)\nPortland: How the Blazers got here is a hero\u2019s journey. They were swept from the first round by the New Orleans Pelicans in last year\u2019s playoffs, and the NBA intelligentsia largely left them for dead. But Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum apparently do not die. They somehow never stop coming back stronger and better.\nLillard took out the Oklahoma City Thunder in Round 1 with one of the greatest close-out game performances in NBA history, and McCollum ousted the Denver Nuggets in Round 2 with an almost equally dramatic Game 7 performance. Both were marked by signature moments \u2014 Dame\u2019s 37-foot game-winner and CJ\u2019s late chase-down block \u2014 that finally pounded into our brains: Yes, you can win with two 6-foot-3 playmaking guards leading the way, or at least with these two.\nThe Blazers were written off once center Jusuf Nurkic snapped his leg in two at the end of March, but the resilience of Enes Kanter and emergence of Zach Collins helped Portland answer some questions about whether they can win without him. That they have done so despite more inconsistent play from stalwart swingmen Al-Farouq Aminu and Mo Harkless is further testament to Lillard and McCollum.\nPortland\u2019s backcourt is averaging 54 points on 44/39/80 shooting splits, along with 10.6 rebounds and 9.4 assists per game in the playoffs. You don\u2019t need much help when they\u2019re giving you that kind of production, and they\u2019ve gotten more than they bargained for from midseason additions Kanter and Rodney Hood (who enter this series battling shoulder and knee injuries suffered against Denver, respectively).\nMostly, though, Portland has gotten through by playing smart and hard and together. They rarely give away extra possessions and work to get more, playing with the import of a team marked by stability and a sense that everyone knows his place in the hierarchy. Whether that matters against a team that has proven time and again to be more talented, with or without Durant, we are about to find out.\nHead to head\nSince we aren\u2019t clear whether Durant will be available and for how long, since Nurkic was really good against the Warriors, and since neither Curry nor Green played in a game Golden State won by 28, it\u2019s hard to draw many conclusions about the first season series split of the Steve Kerr era between the two teams.\nYet, it does feel like there is something to the Blazers winning in Oracle Arena for the first time since November 2013 \u2014 on another Lillard game-winner with 6.3 seconds left, no less \u2014 and then blowing the Warriors out at home in their most recent meeting. Both of those games featured the full Cousins-less contingent of Golden State stars, with Looney playing center, and that has to give Portland even more confidence than they already exude, especially if Durant remains sidelined.\nDurant was remarkable \u2014 and remarkably consistent \u2014 against the Blazers, averaging 28.8 points (on 57.5/41.2/76.2 shooting splits), 6.3 rebounds, 6.3 assists and three combined blocks and steals over the four meetings. Likewise, Nurkic was really impressive against the Warriors this year, averaging 20.3 points, 10 rebounds and 3.3 assists in the four games. Both of their absences impact the apexes of the two teams in different ways, but neither is unaccustomed to playing without them.\nMcCollum was fairly inefficient in all four games against Golden State during the regular season, averaging 18 points on 18 shots and shooting a combined 11 of 40 (3 for 18 from 3-point range) when guarded by Curry, Thompson or Iguodala. Lillard wasn\u2019t so efficient, either \u2014 until he hit the game-winner in their second meeting, and then he finished with 69 points on 23-of-38 shooting (12 of 21 from 3-point range) and 13 assists over the final two meetings. They both need to be great to win this series.\nCurry and Thompson were themselves against the Blazers, save for a 2-for-16 stinker from Klay in the blowout loss on Feb. 13. Green is a wildcard, as always. He was mostly ordinary against the Blazers during the regular season, as he was against everyone, but he has been great in the playoffs. His ability to make shots and then hold up against Kanter\u2019s relentless offensive rebounding will go a long way in determining how often Golden State can play its vaunted small-ball lineups.\nLikely starting lineups\nWith Durant out for Game 1 and unlikely for Game 2, the Warriors will likely stick with the same starting lineup that finished the Houston series: Curry, Thompson, Iguodala, Green and Bogut. Durant and Cousins will probably supplant Iguodala and Bogut if they return, although Kerr may also consider starting Looney at center.\nGolden State\u2019s best non-Durant lineups in the playoffs have both featured Looney. And while even the lineup of Curry, Thompson, Durant and Green with Looney finished a net negative against Portland during the regular season, that was before Nurkic went down. It will be interesting to see if Kanter can make Looney pay in the same way, or if Looney\u2019s athleticism can help the Warriors run Kanter off the floor.\nOtherwise, how much Bogut do we see in this series? Can he match Kanter\u2019s effort at age 34? Or is Green their best option against stronger centers? Will the Blazers counter with Collins and open themselves up to Golden State\u2019s more versatile lineups? The return of Cousins could throw another wrench into this mix. How Kerr and Portland coach Terry Stotts manage the matchups at center will be one of the few variables to watch, because there aren\u2019t many adjustments in the backcourt, where Curry, Thompson, Lillard and McCollum will throw haymakers at each other.\nThe Blazers have stuck with the same starting lineup throughout the playoffs: Lillard, McCollum, Harkless, Aminu and Kanter. That group did not face Golden State together this season, since Portland signed Kanter on the day of their last meeting. They are also a minus-39 in 226 minutes as a unit in 12 playoff games.\nAll three of Portland\u2019s most-used playoff lineups have been outscored. They have found success with Hood (who is day-to-day with a hyperextended left knee) and Collins. Evan Turner and Seth Curry have had nice stretches, too. Regardless of the machinations around Lillard and McCollum, though, the fact of the matter is that the Blazers are plus-29 with them on the court together in the playoffs. Unfortunately, those two were also a minus-24 together against the Warriors in the regular season.\nKevin Durant has been ruled out for Game 1 and unlikely for Game 2. (Getty Images)\nMatchups to watch\nLillard vs. Curry: There will be some cross-switching going on here. Lillard will defend Curry, but the Warriors usually throw Thompson on Lillard and leave Steph to chase McCollum. But that\u2019s neither here nor there. Given their size and scoring ability, Lillard and Curry are the two most electrifying players on the planet. They can ignite their respective home crowds like nobody else, and it will be a delight to watch them try to torch each other on this stage. For the record, Curry scored 38 points on 26 shots in 97 possessions over three games with Lillard as his primary defender this season. Lillard scored 26 points on 27 shots in 138 possessions opposite Thompson (and 12 points on five shots in 12 possessions against Curry).\nMcCollum vs. Jennifer: When Durant joined McCollum\u2019s podcast this past summer, they had a debate about Cousins joining the Warriors. KD told McCollum, \u201cYou know you guys aren\u2019t going to win a championship,\u201d adding that the Blazers guard was crazy to think making playoffs made him a winner. McCollum took issue and later called Durant\u2019s and Cousins\u2019 ring-chasing \u201cdisgusting.\u201d A Twitter user responded, \u201cWin a playoff game then talk,\u201d to which McCollum now famously said, \u201cI\u2019m trying Jennifer.\u201d This has become a rallying cry for him during a spectacular playoff run, and now he and his Blazers have their shot to prove Durant wrong.\nGreen vs. Portland\u2019s bigs: The Warriors were plus-23 in 107 minutes against the Blazers with Green on the court and minus-8 in 90 minutes without him. They were minus-17 in 98 minutes with Looney on the floor against Portland and plus-32 in 99 minutes without him. Given Cousins\u2019 absence and Bogut\u2019s age, Green could draw a heavier load at the center position, where he held Kanter and Collins to a combined four points on 14 shots over 61 possessions in one-on-one matchups this season. The death lineup \u2014 with Green manning the middle \u2014 has long been Golden State\u2019s greatest weapon, but can it still be without Durant helping to protect the rim? Green is a weapon the Blazers can\u2019t really match, but he has to be sharp.\nHow Golden State can win\nThere are many ways the Warriors can win. If Durant ever returns healthy, I think he\u2019s right: The Blazers have no chance. Even without KD, if Curry and Thompson outscore Lillard and McCollum, Golden State is in great shape. In the first two years of the Kerr era, the Warriors were 11-2 against the Blazers without Durant, including 4-1 in the playoffs. Entering this season, they were 10-1 (4-0 in the playoffs) against Portland after acquiring KD. Despite the split series during this regular season, it\u2019s hard to ignore that track record, no matter how much the improvement of Portland\u2019s backcourt and the age of Golden State\u2019s supporting cast has closed the gap.\nHow Portland can win\nLillard and McCollum get hot. Curry and Thompson go cold. Kanter and Collins play plus minutes against Golden State\u2019s bigs. Durant never returns. Portland\u2019s swingmen \u2014 Harkless, Aminu, Hood and Turner \u2014 outwork their too-old or too-young counterparts on the Warriors. And we get a Seth Curry game. Little brothers everywhere need to see Seth take it to Steph\u2019s super-team at least once. This all sounds like a lot, but you don\u2019t take down the two-time defending champs easily.\nPrediction: Warriors in seven. Six if Durant gets healthy.\nEastern Conference finals preview: Milwaukee Bucks vs. Toronto Raptors\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nBen Rohrbach is a staff writer for Yahoo Sports.

    "https://www.canyon-news.com/adam-newman-is-alive-on-yr/92229": "HOLLYWOOD\u2014Can you believe it after waiting what seemed like years, \u201cThe Young and the Restless\u201d have finally brought Adam Newman back to the foray. I will admit Michael Munhey made the character iconic, and Justin Hartley came on board and made the character his own. That is very difficult to do in the soap arena and a rare accomplishment to say the least. Rather Mark Grossman can fill the shoes previously held by Munhey and Hartley only time will tell, but it looks like \u201cY&R\u201d is finally looking to bring back a worthy villain to the soap world.\nSo at last, the audience finally knows exactly what Victor has been up to with all those secret trips to Las Vegas. At first I thought it would be Victoria who would discover what dear ole dad was up to, but nope, it\u2019s the one woman who I secretly think has always held a special place in Adam\u2019s heart. That person is Sharon. Yes, Rey was hired by Nikki to find out exactly what her hubby was up to. Rey confronted a psychiatrist that Victor had apparently hired. As Rey and Sharon dug, Victor was forced to spill the truth to Sharon.\nYes, he admitted that Adam Newman is very much alive and did not die in that cabin explosion. Sharon was flabbergasted by the revelation. Not just because Adam was alive, but Victor wanted her to travel back down a slippery slope to help Adam. Hmm, I see where this is headed, another complicated love triangle just when Sharon was in a happy place with Rey, her former lover Adam returns from the grave. Sharon is afraid to go down that rabbit hole, and once Rey learned all the mayhem Adam put Sharon thru, he should be worried if he regains his memory.\nYes, Adam has amnesia and cannot remember anything before the explosion. So typical in the soap world America, but I sense Adam\u2019s return is about to deliver some juicy stories in the coming weeks. Why? Melissa Claire Egan is slated to reprise her role as Chelsea Newman. Remember last time we say Chelsea she was on the run with Connor after being exposed by Phyllis of all people. This should be epic fun because it will give Nick something to do, not to mention it changes everything for Nick with Christian. Remember Christian is Adam\u2019s son, not Nick\u2019s, and Adam never came face-to-face with his child with Sage.\nOh, this is perfect timing to see some iconic characters return to \u201cY&R\u201d to infuse a bit of drama to the soap, which has been lackluster a bit lately. Kyle and Lola finally consummated their relationship, which has scorned Summer to a degree. I mean they\u2019re married, and they have to work together, and it\u2019s causing all types of friction at Jabot. It was just a matter of time before Summer\u2019s antics came back to haunt her, but we also know how devious Summer can be when she wants something. Remember her seduction of Billy?\nIn other relationship news in the Rosales family, it seems Mia and Arturo just can\u2019t keep their hands off one another. They sunk their relationships and there isn\u2019t much they can do to change the outcome at this point, but Paul cuffed Mia as the clues about her role in Lola\u2019s attack came to light. And perhaps in one of the most out of left-field moves, I sense the writers might be pairing Cane and Traci? It feels that way, but I cannot be 100 percent certain. Also it is fun to finally see Devon move on after Hilary with Elena of all people, someone who has suffered an immense loss in her lifetime as well.\nSo Adam Newman is about to be the catalyst for the return of some major \u201cY&R\u201d characters, I\u2019m sensing November sweeps will be epic compared to May sweeps.",

    "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/wildfire/sd-me-alpine-blaze-20180706-story.html": "Fire crews have made solid progress containing Friday\u2019s biggest blaze, boosting containment of the West Fire significantly overnight.\nAbout 7:30 a.m., Cal Fire San Diego announced that the wildfire still burning near Alpine is now 30 percent contained and has consumed 400 acres, the same number released 10 hours earlier when containment was estimated at just 5 percent.\nWind-driven embers cause the West Fire to spread quickly from its ignition point near Interstate 8 and West Willows Road, causing evacuations as some homes burnt to the ground. Cal Fire said that, so far, 18 structures have been destroyed and eight more damaged. Evacuation orders remain in place until further notice.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cCrews are making good progress,\u201d said Cal Fire Capt. Kendall Bortisser. \u201cDamage assessment teams are still out there. There are still some areas they haven\u2019t gotten into. The number of structures destroyed and damaged will likely go up as they continue to work on their assessment.\u201d\nHe said officials are putting a plan together this morning figuring out what roads to reopen.\n\u201cThey\u2019re working to get this stuff done so we can get people back to their homes,\u201d Bortisser said.\nDeclared a local emergency by Friday afternoon, the West Fire presented special challenges for firefighters as it appeared to hopscotch through neighborhoods. And the weather wasn\u2019t helping. As they push for full containment, crews will continue to toil in the summer\u2019s first real heat wave which sent temperatures to 108 in Alpine Friday. Saturday\u2019s high is predicted to reach 103 degrees.\nAlpine resident Kiersten Pinard was among those scrambling to grab what she could and get out as the fire chewed through a home four houses down the road.\n\u201cI was super scared, super upset \u2026 (thinking) that our house was going to be gone,\u201d said Pinard, who was forced to evacuate from a different Alpine home during the 2003 fires. \u201cBut you know, my husband was at work, my daughter was at school, so we were safe. That\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d\nThe fire delivered relatively-random doses of devastation.\n\u201cThere are homes that are perfectly untouched, and others that are burned to the ground,\u201d Alpine Fire Protection District Chief Bill Paskle said.\nBy 5 p.m., fire crews were able to stop the fire from continuing to spread forward.\n#WestFire [update] The forward rate of spread has been stopped. pic.twitter.com/a8FqKcTxqP \u2014 CAL FIRE/SAN DIEGO COUNTY FIRE (@CALFIRESANDIEGO) July 7, 2018\nDubbed the West fire, it was the largest of three brush fires reported in the county Friday. One burned about 10 acres and at least one large structure in Dulzura in East County and another was threatening homes on the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base in North County.\nFire crews from around the county joined the fight in Alpine to protect residences set amid tall trees and landscaping along winding roads.\nShortly before 2:30 p.m., county officials proclaimed it a local emergency \u2014 a move that requests all federal and state assistance that may be available.\nBy a 4 p.m. news briefing, Cal Fire officials said 400 acres had been scorched with 5 percent containment, and forward progress of the fire had almost stopped.\nOne Alpine firefighter suffered slight burns on his face and was hospitalized overnight.\n\u201cWe have made great progress (on the fire) but there is still a lot of work to be done,\u201d said Cal Fire Capt. Kendal Bortisser.\nOfficials had no count on how many structures had burned, nor how many people had been evacuated. There was also no estimate of when people might be able to return to their homes.\nBy late afternoon, most of the hot spots bedeviling crews were located in between homes. Many were \u201cdamaged, destroyed or continuing to burn,\u201d Cal Fire Chief Daryll Pina said, adding that until that situation is control, no one will be allowed back home.\nPina also said there was no plan to fly firefighting aircraft into the night.\n\u201cWe have made great progress (on the fire) but there is still a lot of work to be done.\u201d \u2014 Cal Fire Capt. Kendal Bortisser\nEarly on, a heavy column of gray smoke could be seen on television news footage billowing westward, pushed by winds on what was on record as the hottest day of the year so far.\nTemperatures in Alpine were reported at 108 degrees at noon, according to the National Weather Service.\nA little later in the afternoon, winds were out of the northeast at 4 miles an hour, gusting to 19 miles an hour, according to meteorologist Adam Roser of the National Weather Service.\nFlames first were reported south of I-8 near the West Willows Road off-ramp in the East County rural community about 11:20 a.m. By 1 p.m., the blaze had grown to 150 acres; by 2:30 p.m. it had consumed an estimated 350 acres.\n.#WestFire update:\nIC reports the fire at 350 acres, 0% contained. For evacuation and road closure updates follow @readysandiego \u2014 CAL FIRE/SAN DIEGO COUNTY FIRE (@CALFIRESANDIEGO) July 6, 2018\nCal Fire officials by mid-afternoon said the rate of spread was deemed \u201ccritical,\u201d meaning that it was fast-moving.\nAerial television footage showed what appeared to be five or six mobile homes and vehicles on fire. Later footage showed single family homes catching fire.\nSoon after the West fire began, the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s Alpine station tweeted that immediate evacuations were needed in the Highland Mobile Home park and the surrounding community. That information later was corrected to say the Alpine Oaks park was evacuated, not Highland.\nAt the Alpine Oaks Mobile Home Park, firefighters sprayed foam as multiple homes burned. The county later issued a boil-water order for the 66 homes at the park, citing fire damage to the park\u2019s water system.\nAside from the park, homes destroyed by fire were spotted on several streets, including Olive View, Scenic View, Viejas View and Pine View, as well as on South Grade.\nA spokeswoman for the Cleveland National Forest said fire ground crews were trying to hold the line on South Grade Road, to prevent flames from bearing down further south and west toward town.\nOfficials said evacuees could go to Viejas Casino, at 5000 Willows Road, where the Red Cross set up a canteen with drinks and snacks.\nRed Cross spokeswoman Emily Cox said an overnight shelter was opened at Los Coches Creek Middle School, 9669 Dunbar Ln. east of El Cajon. Companion pets were to be allowed there.\nIn the parking lot outside the shelter, Ben Stanfill sat sweating on a rock, his motorcycle helmet propped on a smaller rock at his feet.\nHe got a call at 1:10 p.m. from his mother, asking him to go to her house and pick up her cat. He raced there on his motorcycle, where he met up with his sister and her boyfriend.\nA little before 4 p.m., Stanfill, his mother, his sister and her boyfriend all finally arrived together, loaded down with whatever they could take.\n\u201cWe just grabbed everything you can\u2019t replace or re-buy,\u201d Stanfill said. \u201cMy grandma\u2019s photographs, the cat, my sister\u2019s Mickey Mouse teddy bear she\u2019s had since she was little.\u201d\nStanfill\u2019s mother\u2019s house was not in a mandatory evacuation area, but the family just wanted to be safe. As of about 4 p.m., they didn\u2019t know how close the blaze might be to her home.\n\u201cNow we just wait and see,\u201d Stanfill said.\nPower lines in the area burned, initially knocking out electricity to 1,682 customers, according to the San Diego Gas & Electric Co. website. Most of those customers had power restored by 3:30 p.m.\nArea resident Enrique Camargo said he ran toward the fire area to check its progress after getting word that he was supposed to evacuate. As he checked on the fire, he said, his wife was home packing the car.\nHe said was still not sure if they would follow through with evacuating.\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what happens,\u201d Camargo said.\nAnother resident, who asked not to use his last name, said in a cell phone call Friday about 1:30 p.m. he was perhaps 600 yards from the fire. He had no idea if his home was OK.\n\u201cI can\u2019t get to my house,\u201d Randy said. \u201cThey (officials) won\u2019t let me get to my house.\u201d\nAt one point, traffic on I-8 had backed up as far as Peutz Valley Road, and vehicles were seen heading the wrong way down the eastbound off-ramp at Tavern Road.\nAs of 2 p.m., the California Highway Patrol shut down some eastbound Interstate 8 lanes, but those were later reopened. However, as of 3 p.m, closures remained at both Tavern Road off-ramps, as well as the off-ramp on westbound I-8 at West Willows Road.\nUpdate: All eastbound I-8 lanes open at West Willows Rd.\nEastbound I-8 on-ramp from Tavern Road and eastbound I-8 off-ramp to West Willows Road remain closed due to #WestFire\nQuickMap road updates: https://t.co/ryOtbbVqK1 #SDCaltransAlert pic.twitter.com/GTxLD6OmVa \u2014 Caltrans San Diego (@SDCaltrans) July 6, 2018\nAccording to the county\u2019s Department of Public Works, road closures included:\nAlpine Blvd between Tavern Road to West Willows road\nArnold Way between Tavern Road to Alpine Blvd\nSouth Grade Road between Tavern Road to Alpine Blvd\nTavern Road at Dehesa Road intersection\nAlpine- Road closures\nAlpine Blvd between Tavern Road to West Willows road\nArnold Way between Tavern Road to Alpine Blvd\nSouth Grade Road between Tavern Road to Alpine Blvd\nTavern Road at Dehesa Road intersection \u2014 San Diego County DPW (@sdcountydpw) July 6, 2018\nOther surface road closures included South Grade Road and Highland View.\nCounty animal control has assisted in removing a number of pets and other animals threatened by the West Fire, including cats, dogs, goats and horses. As many as 60 horses were removed from the Secret hills Ranch in Alpine, according to initial reports from county officials. Another 16 horses were rescued from a home on Alpine Boulevard.\nThe horses are being sent to Lakeside Rodeo Arena at 12584 Mapleview St.\nOfficers with the San Diego Humane Society were also scouting the area for animals, and had evacuated a kitten found near a burning home.\nAlpine area residents who cannot get past fire lines to return home to rescue small pets can call the county Department of Animal Services emergency dispatcher at (619) 236-2341 and ask for a check at their home.\nThey should give their address and the type of animals that need help or rescuing, said agency Deputy Director Laura Ward.\nEvacuated small animals will be taken to the Bonita shelter at 5821 Sweetwater Rd.\nWard asked that residents who trailer their own horses away from the fire take them places other than the rodeo grounds to leave space open there for emergency stabling.\nAlpine resident Louis Russo said he saw a helicopter and airplane assisting with the air attack on the fire, and that people were releasing their animals as the fire closed in.\n\u201cThis thing is not going to get stopped for awhile,\u201d Russo said.\nHe said his family might evacuate \u2014 they were two miles to the west of the fire \u2014 and that his was one of the homes that lost power.\nStaff writers Alex Riggins and Joshua Emerson Smith, and staff photographer Eduardo Contreras contributed to this report.\npauline.repard@sduniontribune\nTwitter: @pdrepard\nUPDATES:\nThis story is being continually updated as new information is gathered.\n12:10 p.m.: This story was updated.

Today, Google is announcing a slew of new features for Maps users including a new \u201cCommute\u201d tab.\nThe Commute tab for Maps first popped up in a limited rollout in early September, but starting today it\u2019s rolling out to users on Android and iOS. Google says that this new feature is designed to help you \u201ctake control over your commute.\u201d It built the feature with the fact that, in many cities across North America, rush hour traffic can result in a commute that takes up to 60% longer than expected.\nWith the new Commute tab, Google Maps can provide live data on traffic to help you best manage your daily trip to work. It automatically accounts for accidents or heavy traffic and can help you better budget your time to account for that or provide alternate routes. Android users will have notifications on these updates sent to their device before getting caught in the delay.\nThis new tab also better accounts for users who use mixed transportation. If you both drive in a personal vehicle and take public transit, Google Maps can display information for each leg of the trip include departure times for buses and trains.\nYou can see helpful information about when to leave, and for each leg of your trip: you\u2019ll know if there\u2019s traffic on your drive, when the next train departs, and how long it\u2019ll take to walk from the train station to the office. We do the work for you and automatically factor this into your ETA so you can anticipate exactly when you\u2019ll get to work.\nGoogle has also worked with public transit in 80 regions around the globe to start providing real-time location data on subways, trains, and buses. Better yet, Google Maps users in Sydney will be able to see just how full their bus or train is, and this feature is promised for more cities around the world.\nNow, transit riders in 80 regions worldwide will be able to see exactly where their bus or train is in real time on the map. This will help you plan your day more efficiently\u2014you\u2019ll know if you can spend an extra few minutes grabbing coffee, or if you really do need to make a run for it to catch your bus.\nFinally, Google Maps is also adding direct integration with popular music services. Spotify, Apple Music, and Google Play Music will all be available directly within Google Maps\u2019 navigation screen. With Spotify on Android, users will also be able to browse through their songs and playlists too.\nAll of these new features start rolling out to users starting this week on both Android and iOS.\nMore on Google Maps:\nCheck out 9to5Google on YouTube for more news:\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

First he reached accords with several dozen of Saudi Arabia\u2019s richest men, including ministers and family members. They were arrested in November and held until they agreed to part with significant chunks of their wealth, which freed them from their luxurious captivity in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton.\nAnd now the crown prince is going after bin Laden \u2014 of course not the Al-Qaida founder killed by U.S. Navy SEALs in 2011, but the family company, construction giant Saudi Binladin Group.\nRead more: Saudi Crown Prince Goes After the Bin Ladens | Saudi Arabia vs. Qatar: How MBS's Blockade Not Only Failed to Achieve Its Goals but Backfired\nLast week Reuters broke the story, reporting that Riyadh had seized management control of the company from bin Laden family members who were \u201cswept up in an anti-graft drive.\u201d\nOsama bin Laden was part of that family, but the company cut ties with him.\n>> Pakistan and Israel: Separated at birth?\nAt its peak, Binladin Group, founded in 1931, employed more than 100,000 people in 537 companies. Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s takeover began in January, when he forced the company to shake up its board of directors, adding two Mohammed cronies.\nBinladin Group is now set to hand over 35 percent of its shares to the state, losing its status as a family-owned publicly-traded company. It will become subject to the indirect management of Mohammed.\nBinladin Group will be laying off thousands of people, selling some of its companies, and taking part in infrastructure projects and projects the government favors, like the future city of Neom to be perched on the borders of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan.\nThe company was harshly criticized in 2015 when a crane it was operating near the Great Mosque of Mecca collapsed and killed 107 people. Binladin Group was kicked off government projects and eventually had to delay paying salaries and meeting its debts. After the arrest of top people, and with the threat of seizure floating above it, the company didn\u2019t have many choices.\nBinladin Group isn\u2019t the only mega-company Riyadh has seized. Mohammed has also laid his hands on the assets of Waleed al-Ibrahim, the chairman of regional TV broadcaster MBC. Ibrahim was forced to hand over a majority stake in that company in exchange for his freedom. This week the Saudi government let Ibrahim leave the country for Dubai, where his company is based.\nThe Saudi state reached a similar arrangement, though probably a much more expensive one, with the multibillionaire Alwaleed bin Talal.\nThe government\u2019s stated objective of seizing assets is to end the deep corruption that helped win the owners vast wealth. Still, it takes a lot of courage to target companies that spent generations with close links with the royals themselves.\nThe crown prince had no guarantees that these extremely rich men would agree to his \u201ccompromises\u201d rather than tap the Saudi courts (or international ones) to protect their rights. But the prince, who has made a terrific impression in the United States and elsewhere in the West, as a liberal leader with a modern vision, knows how to hit back at people he claims robbed the kingdom.\nYet predictions of Mohammed provoking Saudi business leaders to rise against him haven\u2019t panned out. The capitalists apparently realize they\u2019d better work with the prince lest they lose what they have left; they may also still hope to win projects in the future, albeit at narrower margins.\nA different question is whether foreign investors will keep putting money into Saudi Arabia, where assets could suddenly get nationalized if the prince ever decreed it. Based on reports in the Saudi business press, foreign investments have not dried up, nor are there signs of it slowing.\nThe temptations of investing in Saudi Arabia may be too great for the multinationals to steer clear of the country. Not a company in the world wouldn\u2019t love a chunk of Mohammed\u2019s dream future city, where $500 billion is expected to be invested, or a chance to build resorts on 50 Saudi islands in the Red Sea at a cost of tens of billions.\nNor does the crackdown on Saudi human rights activists, some of whom were arrested this week for allegedly collaborating with foreign governments and harming the kingdom, seem to have dismayed foreign companies. Not even allegations that these activities were being run from embassies provoke a reaction from the countries involved.\nThe Saudi vision involves diversifying income sources and reducing the kingdom\u2019s dependence on oil. Those aren\u2019t new goals, but they\u2019ve been redefined by each royal family over the decades. This time there seems to be at least a chance that the vision will turn into a strategic plan supervised directly by the kingdom\u2019s leader.\nThe plan isn\u2019t confined to shaking down the rich or seizing companies; it involves boosting employment for Saudis at the expense of foreign workers, developing tourism beyond religious tourism, increasing the percentage of women working and updating the universities\u2019 syllabuses so students can learn professions relevant to the labor market.",

And yet, in an era where the private is increasingly public, John McCain managed to keep his family life largely out of the spotlight.\nThough his own actions were very much in the public sphere, the late Senator, who passed away on Saturday after a prolonged battle with brain cancer, eschewed calling attention to his family or sharing tidbits of their personal lives. It was a particularly impressive feat, considering that his brood included seven children born across four decades.\n\u201cIt\u2019s intentional,\u201d McCain once said, when questioned about the conspicuous absence of his family during his 2008 presidential campaign. \u201cI just feel it\u2019s inappropriate for us to mention our children. ...

And yet, from their places in the background, each member of the McCain family helped to shape the Senator into the man who became a major public figure and worked at the heart of the American political scene.\nRelated Story Roberta McCain at 100 and in Command\nCarol McCain\nJohn McCain married his first wife, Carol, in 1965. She was, at the time, a single mother of two boys and would within their first year of marriage give birth to a daughter as well. Their life as a young family was cut short in 1967 when McCain, a Navy pilot, was shot down over Vietnam and held there as a prisoner of war. Carol took on the job of raising her three children on her own, finally welcoming McCain home when he was released in 1973.\nHowever, the years and traumas had taken a toll on their marriage. \u201cAs dad progressed, he was gone a lot, doing a lot of international travel, and it was putting a little stress on the marriage,\u201d their son Andy recalled in the documentary John McCain: For Whom the Bell Tolls. In 1979, McCain met Cindy, who would become his second wife a scant six weeks after his divorce from Carol was finalized. \"I was pretty much blindsided and it broke my heart,\u201d Carol said in the documentary.\nDespite the rocky end to their marriage, though, Carol and McCain maintained a warm relationship in the ensuing decades. \u201cA lot of people tried to get me to say bad things about him during [the 2008 presidential campaign,\" she stated. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Are you crazy?

After wedding Carol, McCain quickly adopted Doug and his younger brother, Andy. Though McCain was shot down over Vietnam in 1967 and held there as a prisoner of war until 1973, it's obvious that his service made a serious impression on his oldest son. Like his father, Doug would go on to become a pilot in the Navy and now serves as a captain for American Airlines, a company that shared a moving tribute to the late Senator.\n\"Senator McCain will be sorely missed but his impact lives on. We will not forget his shining example of patriotism based on the ideals of freedom and equality for all and global leadership by the United States in support of those ideals,\" the airline said in a statement, offering condolences to the McCain family and Doug in particular.\nAndrew McCain\nThe youngest of Carol's sons, 56-year-old Andy also chose to follow a path deeply intwined with his adopted father's life, though in a distinctly different way from his brother's.\nLike all three children from McCain's first marriage, Andy had a strained start with his stepmother Cindy (neither Doug, Andy, nor Sidney reportedly attended the couple's 1980 wedding ceremony), but the two evidently developed close ties over the years. After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and MBA from Vanderbilt, Andy started working for Hensley Beverage Company, a beverage distributorship in association with Anheuser-Busch. The company was founded in 1955 by Cindy's father, Jim Hensely; Andy has served as an executive there for many years.\nJohn and Cindy McCain pose with Andy, Jimmy, Jack, Bridget, Meghan, Doug, and Sidney McCain in February 2000 in New Hampshire.

McCain's third son was so dedicated to following his father's example that the Naval Academy was the only school he applied to when he graduated high school. \u201cI want to be a part of our family legacy,\u201d he reportedly said. The decision ultimately paid off, with Jack carrying on the family's aviation tradition by becoming a MH-60 Seahawk helicopter pilot.\nIn 2013, he married Renee Swift McCain, a former Air Force Reserve captain.\n\"It is not the man that was great, but instead it was his desire to serve a cause greater than himself that defined his life. To me, he was a giant, but to him he was an imperfect servant of the nation he loved deeply,\" Jack wrote on Twitter following his father's death. \"Fair winds, following seas, and clear skies.\"\nJames \"Jimmy\" McCain\nThe youngest of the McCain boys, Jimmy, 30, also followed in his father's footsteps by enlisting for military service. Rather than training as a pilot, though, Jimmy chose to serve as a Marine, including a tour in Iraq when he was 19. It was in this, perhaps, that McCain most prominently showed his dedication to not using his family for political points, refusing to mention his son's active service even when questioned about the military situation in Iraq at the time.\nAt McCain's funeral, Jimmy read out McCain's favorite poem, Requiem by Robert Louis Stevenson.

Cindy obtained visas and managed to bring the baby back to the US for medical treatment\u2014all without informing her husband. The first McCain learned of it, according to former McCain aide Wes Gullett was when Cindy and Bridget got off the plane from Bangladesh. \"He asked: 'Where is she going?'\" Gullett explained, introducing Bridget at the 2008 Republican National Convention.\"To which [Cindy] replied: 'To our house.'\"\n\"[Overseas adoptions] were very odd, rare things then, but Cindy never said anything more than, \u2018We have this baby now,'\" a family friend told People. \"Just \u2018This is my daughter, she\u2019s from Bangladesh, I couldn\u2019t leave without her.'\"\nOn Thursday August 30th, Bridget read a bible verse at the memorial service for her father at North Phoenix Baptist Church.\nRelated Story 10 Inspiring Quotes From John McCain\nRelated Story John McCain's Memorial Service in Photos",

Champagne all around.\nBloomberg reports that Bezos' net worth briefly broke the $150 billion mark Monday, right on the eve of Amazon Prime Day. No single human has been that rich since 1982, when Forbes started tracking rich people's wealth. Bill Gates came close during the dot com boom in the late '90s, but his wealth peaked at a mere $100 billion\u2014that's about $149 billion now, with inflation.\nBy the end of the day, Forbes reports that Bezos' wealth dipped back down to $149.7 billion when Amazon's shares fell. Still, Bezos is worth about $56 billion more than Gates.\nMuch of Bezos' wealth comes from Amazon, which is why it fluctuates when Amazon's market shares fluctuate; he owns 16 percent of the company. He spends a lot of money on Blue Origin, which competes directly with SpaceX in space travel. He also owns The Washington Post. Nice work if you can get it.\nBezos is less generous with his billions than Gates and Gates' foundation. However, he funded scholarships for DACA students this year, and he tweeted in April that he's planning to do more philanthropic work. Hey, that's a start, right?",

This is not because I am locked in a dark cabin on the presidential zeppelin, it\u2019s because I now see how wise President Casey is and what clever ideas these are and I am very sorry that we all laughed at him.

That said, Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael should probably be obliged to put someone forward in future to keep the overconfident business loons at bay. Surely some respectable only marginally-compromised elder statesfolk could have been conjured up from obscurity to give Michael D Higgins some proper competition? It might have helped. Right now the presidency looks like something you run for as a bet. We have seven more years to think about what we've done.\n*This article was written well before there was any inkling of a result.

There is room to add strength and to be a problem when rushing the passer.\nBiggest Reach\nI do not have a name for you, but I do have a position. Offensive line. I know it is often about having numbers along the offensive line. Notre Dame is taking four of them in this class. This means one or two are more than likely never going to see the field, hence being a reach.\nImpact Freshman\nI am not including punter Jay Bramblett from the list for this one and going with Jacob Lacey. Notre Dame showed they are willing to rotate in defensive lineman throughout the season. I think Lacey will benefit from being an early enrolle and play impactful snaps as a freshman.\nClass MVP\nKyle Hamilton. I watched this guy\u2019s highlight tape and he looks the part of a dominating safety. I just think he is the most sure thing that Notre Dame just pulled in. The size, speed and football focused attitude are all things pointing towards Kyle Hamilton being a star.\nFuture Captain\nMarist Liufau. The players that Notre Dame signs from Hawaii are always betting than the star ranking given to them. I would expect to Liufau to come to Notre Dame with much to learn and weight to add. I also expect Liufau to be an impactful player on the field during his time in South Bend. I think of Robby Toma and Manti Te\u2019o and see them as leaders. I\u2019m guessing Marist Liufau will bring a great work ethic and outstanding leadership to Notre Dame.\nWell, there are my best guesses for the 2019 class. I think the Notre Dame coaching staff did a solid job. The class lacks the \u201cstar power\u201d at the top but there are a bunch of good football players coming to Notre Dame.",

In a recent interview with Rajeev Masand, Neena revealed that she had met Shah Rukh Khan and Karan Johar on a plane around that time and had asked the two to convince her daughter to let go of her aspirations to become an actress in Bollywood films.\nAnd while they had promised to help out, none of them picked the call, when she did call them. Neena replied saying, \"So mean and cheap kind of people they are. They gave me their number and phir phone he nahi uthate thay.\" However, she was pleasantly surprised when Rajeev told her than one of them had told him about her request to convince Masaba not to become an actor. Neena then went on to explain the reason behind her not wanting Masaba to act.\nShe said, \"I told her if you want to be an actor then you go abroad.

    "https://www.sbnation.com/2019/4/25/18514465/dawson-knox-buffalo-bills-ole-miss-nfl-draft": "Ole Miss had arguably the most talented group of pass-catchers in college football in 2018. D.K. Metcalf and A.J. Brown are clear early-round picks, and Damarkus Lodge also has a chance to get drafted.\nWhile those players are a dynamic trio, Ole Miss produced another talented pass-catcher in tight end Dawson Knox. But Knox didn\u2019t have the production you would expect from such a prospect, with 15 catches on 28 targets in 2018.\nThe Buffalo Bills saw something in Knox, and selected him with the 96th pick in the 2019 NFL Draft.\nEven though Knox didn\u2019t see too many opportunities in college, he was still pretty efficient with his touches. In 2018 he averaged 18.9 yards per catch.\nCollege production is important, but don\u2019t worry too much about Knox\u2019s. Just watch the tape.\nKnox may not have seen the ball all that often in college, but he\u2019s still a pretty talented receiving tight end. Knox can do just about everything when it comes to catching the football. He can make plays in traffic deep down the field, secure tough catches over the middle, and run after the catch.\nThis play against Vanderbilt \u2014 his only catch of the day \u2014 shows off his ability to high point the ball deep down the field. Vanderbilt has two defenders in the vicinity, but he\u2019s still able to come down with the ball.\nKnox also has the athleticism to create plays after the catch, with solid speed and agility showings at the NFL Combine. This play against Arkansas is a great example:\nOle Miss runs him into the flat, and he gets a great block from Lodge to spring him free for more yards. Knox isn\u2019t a speed demon, but he still has enough juice to make defenses pay when he has a crease.\nIn the few opportunities Knox did get, he showed off the ability to be a legitimate threat as a passing target.\nWhich begs the following question:\nSo ... why didn\u2019t Knox get the ball more often?\nSB Nation caught up with Knox at the 2019 NFL Combine to try and figure out why a player who is clearly talented wasn\u2019t a bigger piece of the offense.\nKnox\u2019s answer was pretty simple: Brown, Metcalf, and Lodge are really, really good.\n\u201cGoing into the season, I was hoping that it would help me a little more than it did,\u201d Knox said. \u201cI was like, \u2018I got three potential first-round guys \u2014 definitely two or three top-two-round guys around me \u2014 they\u2019re gonna be doubling those guys, so surely I\u2019ll get the ball more.\u2019 But it was still fun playing with guys of that talent.\u201d\nOne thing working in Knox\u2019s favor as he projects himself to the next level is the fact that NFL offenses feature tight ends more than the offense he played in during college. He\u2019ll get to run more a more diverse set of routes on Sundays than he did for Rebels QB Jordan Ta\u2019amu.\n\u201cFive or six of my 15 catches were on the same route. It would just be a little 12- to 15-yard over route over the middle of the field.\u201d Knox said. \u201cI would be the first read on that, Jordan would find a window and fit it in to me. That was probably my favorite because we ran it the most and I had the most production on those plays.\u201d\nKnox\u2019s ability to catch the ball over the middle was on display in the 2018 Egg Bowl against Mississippi State. This pass was a little high, but that didn\u2019t stop Knox from bringing down with two defenders in the vicinity. He wasn\u2019t afraid to get hit by Mississippi State\u2019s safeties, showing the fearlessness you\u2019d hope to see out of a tight end:\nOf course, NFL teams had similar concerns about his lack of production in college. Knox said he was asked about that during his interviews with teams at the combine.\n\u201cYeah, as you can probably imagine, but honestly I\u2019m not even worried about it because I also have enough film to show that if the ball went to me every time I was open, I\u2019d have as high \u2014 or higher \u2014 stats than anyone here,\u201d Knox said.\n\u201cAlso I know that offensive systems in the NFL are going to be a lot different. Which is something that people might think is going to be a concern for me because I\u2019m only running five or six routes a year at Ole Miss,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the thing I\u2019m most excited about, getting into a system that utilizes matchups more. Just an extended route tree that\u2019s going to open up a lot more things for me.\u201d\nDespite the concerns about his production in college, Knox still looks like a solid NFL prospect. Ole Miss had a lot of mouths to feed in its offense, and he just ended up being an afterthought at times.\nKnox\u2019s ability as a receiver should get him on the field early as a rookie. In a class filled with a few stud tight end prospects, Knox could end up being the best of the bunch.",

That would be Missouri quarterback Drew Lock. He\u2019s a player with first-round talent, but he dropped out of the top 32. With a few teams in the top half of the second round needing a quarterback, Lock may not need to wait long to get picked.\nThe second round could feature some runs on certain positions. In the mock below, for instance, three of the first four picks are cornerbacks. That includes players like Greedy Williams of LSU, Byron Murphy of Washington, and Rock Ya-Sin of Temple. Murphy comes in as the best available player remaining.\nRelated The best available players after the 1st round of the NFL Draft\nWe should see offensive tackles like Cody Ford of Oklahoma and Jawaan Taylor of Florida come off the board pretty early.\nThe other position of intrigue is wide receiver. Except for Baltimore taking Marquise Brown at No. 25 and New England taking N\u2019Keal Harry at No. 32, there was no action at wide receiver Thursday night. Starting with the Ole Miss pair of D.K. Metcalf and A.J. Brown, don\u2019t be surprised if five or more wide receivers get taken in the second round.\nHere\u2019s where they could land:\n33. Arizona Cardinals: Greedy Williams, CB, LSU\n34. Indianapolis Colts: Dre\u2019Mont Jones, DT. Ohio State\n35. Oakland Raiders: Byron Murphy, CB, Washington\n36. San Francisco 49ers: Rock Ya-Sin, CB, Temple\n37.

    "https://www.sbnation.com/wrestling/2018/7/15/17574398/wwe-extreme-rules-2018-results-live-winners-highlights": "Extreme Rules is over, and it brought us new champions, a few matches that were real good for different reasons, and then other matches that also happened during the event.\nWhile there was no Brock Lesnar, Ronda Rousey showed up despite her suspension as promised, and RAW commissioner Kurt Angle made sure to tell us that Brock has to show up on Monday or else be stripped of the Universal Championship.\nWe\u2019ve got all of Extreme Rules 2018 live blogged for you below: consider it your play-by-play, in-depth recap of the event. If you want to start from the beginning of the show, scroll down and work your way back up.\nSeth Rollins vs. Dolph Ziggler (c) in a 30-minute Iron Man match for the Intercontinental Championship\nAnd your main event: an Iron Man match between Intercontinental Champion Dolph Ziggler and the man who he took that title from, Seth Rollins. Rollins has been the best wrestler on RAW (and WWE\u2019s main roster) throughout 2018: the work he did, and Miz before him, is why the Intercontinental Championship can even credibly main event a pay-per-view right now.\nIn case you don\u2019t remember, Iron Man matches have a specific time frame: for this one in particular, it\u2019s 30 minutes. There can be as many falls \u2014 pins, submissions, count outs, disqualifications, whatever \u2014 in those 30 minutes as you can fit in. Whoever has the most wins when the clock runs out is the winner of the whole thing.\nDisqualifications are a fall here, so if Drew McIntyre, who came to the ring with Ziggler, interferes on Dolph\u2019s behalf, he has to do so without getting caught by the ref, or else Ziggler\u2019s record will take a hit.\nSeth is doing jumping jacks in the ring, and why shouldn\u2019t he brag about his energy? He did set a record for time spent wrestling on a single episode of RAW/in a gauntlet match earlier this year, and it was more than twice the time for this Iron Man match, even.\nRollins gets a rollup pin on a surprised Ziggler, and he\u2019s up 1-0 with around 25 minutes to go. Ziggler seems to have woken up thanks to that pin, but it\u2019s not enough \u2014 Rollins ends up getting in a stomp, and goes up 2-0.\nNow Drew McIntyre is beating Rollins down, which gives Seth a third fall and a commanding 3-0 lead, but McIntyre keeps beating on Seth, and Rollins might be ahead, but he\u2019s also unconscious with 20 minutes to go.\nZiggler picks up a pin to make it 3-1 while Rollins is still laying on the ground, which means McIntyre\u2019s attack was worth it: Rollins is still wobbly, and Ziggler had time to reset. There\u2019s a superkick and another pin, and now it\u2019s 3-2, Ziggler. McIntyre was banned from ringside, but the damage is already done.\nNow it\u2019s 3-3, which is good for two reasons: Seth now gets to wrestle from underneath like a face should for the remaining 17 minutes, while Dolph, who is a heel who for some reason still wrestles like a face too often, does not.\n4-3 Ziggler! McIntyre\u2019s beatdown of Rollins continues to pay off for Dolph. There\u2019s an extended rest hold now, but that\u2019s pretty acceptable 18 minutes into a match with 12 more to go, and the timing is right, too, since Rollins is trying to break the streak of Ziggler\u2019s four unanswered falls.\nWe\u2019ve got 10 minutes to go, and Rollins just hit a Blockbuster. The clock is back on the screen, and Seth is staring at it with a sense of urgency. He just misses getting counted out, which would have put Ziggler up 5-3. Rollins hits one of his old finishers \u2014 not the Pedigree, the knee strike \u2014 but it\u2019s not enough to even the score here. It\u2019s still 4-3, Dolph, with 7:30 to go on the clock.\nFrog Splash! Ziggler kicks out again. Seth is going to have to figure something out, because none of his usual tricks are working despite the fact we\u2019re approaching just six minutes left in the Iron Man match.\nA superplex into a Falcon Arrow, but Ziggler kicks out of this, too! Four minutes to go, and Rollins is still down 4-3.\nAnd it\u2019s tied! Rollins rolls up Ziggler to get things to 4-4, and the clock is ticking right past three minutes left. How many more falls are we going to be able to squeeze in here?\nYooo, Seth put Ziggler in a half crab, and then switched to a crossface, and he\u2019s just trying to get Ziggler to slowly leak all his HP while refusing to tap. Seth ends up missing a stomp, and Ziggler rolls out of the ring \u2014 there\u2019s one minute left, and things are all tied up, but Ziggler is feeling a little less well than he was a minute ago.\n30 seconds to go! Rollins counters a superkick with a kick to the head of his own, but he runs out of time on the clock before he can get the pin. Ziggler retains because of the draw, but don\u2019t worry, RAW commissioner Kurt Angle is here to say that shit ain\u2019t ending like this, and orders Ziggler back into the ring for sudden death overtime.\nAnd here\u2019s Drew McIntyre again! He attacks Rollins, giving Ziggler the chance to strike, pin, and retain.\nRusev vs. AJ Styles (c) for the WWE Championship\nIt\u2019s Rusev Day, but a victory here by Rusev could mean that it\u2019s truly Rusev Day. Styles is great and all, but this is Rusev: give Rusev the belt, and then every day will be even more of a Rusev Day than it was before.\nI want it, the crowd wants it, GIVE IT TO US, WWE, GIVE IT TO US NOW\nRusev is in control early, and he\u2019s targeting Styles\u2019 lower back, which will help with Rusev\u2019s finisher, the submission move the Accolade \u2014 it\u2019s a camel clutch, and if your back is already hurting, you don\u2019t stand a chance of escaping.\nStyles finally begins to take control, knocking Rusev outside the ring to the barricade, and then following it up with a Phenomenal Forearm. Rusev is back in the ring, avoiding a count out, and while Styles isn\u2019t in the danger he very recently was, his back is still a problem thanks to Rusev\u2019s earlier attacks. And hey, now we\u2019ve got dueling Rusev/Styles chants going!\nStyles went for a springboard 450, but Rusev avoided it, and nearly locked in the Accolade. Styles gets the Calf Crusher on Rusev on his third try \u2014 he\u2019s been working Rusev\u2019s leg like Rusev has been working Styles\u2019 back \u2014 but Rusev finally gets to the bottom rope and breaks up the submission before he has to tap.\nStyles is not thrilled about Rusev getting to the ropes, and is now going after Aiden English or helping Rusev reach them. The distraction by English works \u2014 it\u2019s one Styles definitely did not have to walk into, either \u2014 and Rusev ends up suplexing him on the outside.\nOohhhh man they got me there. That pin was like a 2.999999 count, but Styles kicked out. AND ANOTHER SUPER CLOSE COUNT, GOD\nRusev can\u2019t fully get the Accolade in, thanks to the damage done to his leg by Styles. He still caused pain to Styles, though, and now Aiden English ripped the top pad off the turnbuckle oh noooo Rusev is the one who went face-first into it.\nOH MAN Rusev kicked out after a springboard 450! MAYBE IT REALLY IS RUSEV DAY\nUgh, it is not. Styles lands a Phenomenal Forearm, and Rusev goes down for the 1-2-3. Styles retains, and today is just a regular Rusev Day.\nNia Jax vs. Alexa Bliss (c) for the RAW Women\u2019s Championship\nAlexa Bliss won the women\u2019s Money in the Bank briefcase last month, used it to end Ronda Rousey\u2019s bid at Nia Jax\u2019s RAW Women\u2019s Championship with a few swings that same night, and then cashed it in on Jax to become champ. Now, she\u2019s facing Jax in a rematch for that belt.\nBliss also pissed off Rousey in the process, both through hitting her with the briefcase and by taunting her the next night on RAW: Rousey then beat Alexa down so hard that she got suspended for 30 days.\nThat suspension is up Wednesday, but Ronda bought a ticket to Extreme Rules, and Alexa is defending against Nia in an Extreme Rules match... which means it\u2019s also legal for Rousey to interfere. This is going to be violent!\nNia Jax is beating the shit out of Alexa Bliss, and it is Good. Bliss might have Mickie James in her corner, but Nia has Natalya, who recently turned face and is pals with Rousey, so might be staying that way for a bit. Or, is going to turn on Rousey tonight in service of Bliss, one or the other.\nSPEAKING OF RONDA\nShe\u2019s beating Mickie James up, because Mickie was hitting Natalya, and Ronda was not about to let that continue. And now she starts chasing Bliss, but James recovers in time to hit Rousey with a kendo stick from behind a few times. And now Mickie is going after Nia with a steel chair! Ronda get up wyd start delivering justice with weapons.\nUgh, Bliss retains following the chair attacks, as Rousey couldn\u2019t get up fast enough \u2014 looks like we\u2019re moving full-speed into Rousey vs. Bliss as a feud, with poor Nia being left behind.\nBobby Lashley vs. Roman Reigns for the right to be booed harder by the audience\nListen, I like Roman Reigns, and hate the way WWE books him, and his whole thing is a poisoned well at this point \u2014 Ian Williams can tell you more. Putting him against Bobby Lashley is... interesting. It\u2019s like a different take on the Jinder Mahal match, where WWE is trying to see if they can make Roman\u2019s opponent so unlikable that he\u2019ll definitely get cheers. Except with Lashley, WWE probably also thinks he\u2019s potentially likable, as they\u2019re writing his awful segments and promos, anyway, so... maybe this one is about seeing if they can get Lashley cheered by facing Roman, who will not be cheered? What a puzzler.\nAnyway this is basically a pissing contest happening inside a ring because Brock Lesnar isn\u2019t around to defend the Universal Championship. The good news is that it\u2019s not happening as the main event, so it\u2019s good that those rumors didn\u2019t come to fruition.\nThe crowd is chanting, and it is not for the match. It would help a lot if Bobby Lashley had a personality since his return other than, \u201cno, I did serve in the military\u201d and \u201cactually, I do love my sisters.\u201d\nThis match isn\u2019t bad, by the way: it just kind of is. It\u2019s very WWE-style power guy vs. power guy, moving slow, utilizing rest holds and big forearms in equal measure. You only want me typing that so many times, I\u2019m guessing, so.\nThe good news is that they\u2019re starting to up the ante, power-wise, so bigger moves are being hit. And hey, the crowd is split about 50/50 for Roman, which isn\u2019t necessarily support for Lashley, but at least it sounds like it is through the broadcast.\nThe crowd remember that Lashley\u2019s finisher, in 2018, is a stalling vertical suplex, and suddenly, the Reigns cheers are louder.\nWell then! Reigns went for a spear, and Lashley countered with one of his own, and then pinned Reigns. It looks like my prediction from early April is real close to coming true:\nBrock is going to break Punk's modern-day WWE world title record for reign length, lose to Lashley at SummerSlam, then go back to UFC when his suspension is up. \u2014 Marc Normandin (@Marc_Normandin) April 9, 2018\nListen, I didn\u2019t want to bring it into the world, but not tweeting it wasn\u2019t going to stop it, either.\nTeam Hell No (Daniel Bryan and Kane) vs. the Bludgeon Brothers (c) for the SmackDown Tag Team Championship\nDaniel Bryan and Kane took a beating from the Bludgeon Brothers backstage earlier during this event, so it\u2019s unclear if Team Hell No is going to be prepared for this championship fight. We\u2019ll have to wait and see after the entrances and this promo video.\nDaniel Bryan is here, clutching his ribs but yessing away all the same. The Bludgies are coming out next, which means no Kane, maybe? Does this mean Bryan has to try to fight them alone, or that Kane is going to enter late and make the save for Bryan? Or enter late and turn on Bryan? So many possibilities!\nBryan\u2019s alone here \u2014 no Kane to start, at least. The good news is that if Daniel Bryan wins this by himself, he can yell \u201cI\u2019m the tag team champions!\u201dand have it be both technically and grammatically accurate.\nDB did a solid job of fending off Harper and Rowan, but the damned numbers game eventually got to him, and now he\u2019s taking a beating from the two as they tag in and out, with nowhere for Bryan to escape.\nBryan, as he does, found a way! He moved out of the way of a Harper suicide dive to the outside, so Harper hit his own teammate with it. And here\u2019s Kane! In a walking boot! The Demon\u2019s Walking Boot, probably, but a walking boot.\nAnd Bryan gets to him for a tag! Kane does damage standing in place \u2014 he\u2019s very practiced at that, given he\u2019s had awful knees forever now \u2014 and lays out the Bludgies.\nIt\u2019s not enough, though, as Bryan gets beat down again upon his return to the ring, and the Bludgeon Brothers retain after hitting their finisher. Now we wait and see if Kane and Bryan can still be buds, or if they\u2019re in a difficult emotional place following a loss.\nBraun Strowman vs. Kevin Owens in a steel cage match\nFinally, a match with moderately more extreme rules. Braun Strowman has Kevin Owens where he can\u2019t run away: inside a steel cage. This match will work perfectly for me if Braun never tries to escape the cage, and instead just focuses on keeping Owens from escaping, i.e., attempts to end Kevin Owens.\nilu KO but it\u2019s Braun, I\u2019m not about to tell him to do or not do anything.\nKevin Owens tries to escape, repeatedly, and then realizes he\u2019s probably going to have to fight just a little bit. He laid into Strowman a bit, attempted a pin, aaaaaaand was immediately thrown off. Go back to trying to escape, Kev.\nWell, assuming he still knows he\u2019s even in a place he needs to escape, as Braun is throwing him around the walls again and again, to the crowd\u2019s delight \u2014 they\u2019re chanting \u201cone more time\u201d after each one.\nOwens handcuffed Braun to the top rope! Now he\u2019s trying to escape following a \u201csuck it\u201d crotch chop. oh god strowman broke the handcuffs and caught Owens before he left the cage.\nOh Braun, great visual, but you lost the match now. Not that it matters, because Owens just lost the goddamn war: Braun chokeslammed Owens off of the top of the cage through the announce table far below, and since Owens technically had his feet hit the ground first, he wins. It, uh, was probably not worth it for Kevin.\nCHOKESLAM FROM THE TOP OF THE CAGE! pic.twitter.com/scH8WVl2Hg \u2014 SB Nation (@SBNation) July 16, 2018\nThe thing about this is that normally, the heel would claim they won despite how they won, and rub said victory in their opponent\u2019s face, eventually forcing another match. Owens is probably just going to quietly accept his W and hope Braun forgets he exists for his own safety. Good twist on a classic tale, and hey, Braun never tried to escape the cage: he just wanted Owens to get what Strowman felt he deserved, and he sure did.\nShinsuke Nakamura vs. Jeff Hardy (c) for the United States Championship\nNakamura, fresh off of his dick-punch-filled feud with AJ Styles for the WWE Championship, has downgraded a bit and set his sights on Jeff Hardy and the United States Championship. Jeff Hardy is back to wearing creepy face paint, so this feud is good, actually.\nahahaha Shinsuke uppercutted Hardy right in the willows before the bell rang, and then once the match began, hit him in the face with the Kinshasa: Nakamura gets the pin, and he\u2019s the new United States champ!\nThere have been all kinds of reports of Jeff Hardy being hurt and wrestling through it, so if you were looking for confirmation of just how hurt, the low-blow-plus-finisher match is probably what you were looking for.\nAnd here comes Randy Orton, fresh off a haircut, staring down Nak. And apparently he\u2019s returned as heel Randy Orton, as he kicked Hardy in the dick for good measure and then sauntered off.\nAsuka vs. Carmella for the SmackDown Women\u2019s Championship\nIt\u2019s the rematch we\u2019ve all been waiting for, and hopefully the one where Asuka destroys James Ellsworth\u2019s corporeal form. He\u2019ll be suspended above the ring in a shark cage, so it won\u2019t happen immediately, but maybe after he tries to interfere somehow, his time on this plane will come to an end.\nIt took like, five seconds for James Ellsworth to drop a weapon down from the cage \u2014 he\u2019s wearing a bulky outfit, and it\u2019s definitely full of weapons. Asuka saw it before any damage could be done, though: it\u2019s important to note that this match is not under extreme rules, either, so Carmella can\u2019t legally use any of these weapons.\nWeapon number two dropped the cage also did not work out for Carmella.\nEllsworth got free from the cage, and is now inadvertently acting as a distraction, as he got caught on the cage and Asuka is kicking the shit out of him while Carmella lays outside the ring.\nEveryone is trying to stop Asuka from kicking Ellsworth into oblivion, but they\u2019re failing. The problem is that Carmella is awake again, and just threw Asuka face-first into the cage. A pin already? Jesus, guys, I know you need to find ways to get Carmella to top the most frightening wrestler in the women\u2019s division/possibly your entire company, but come on.\nAlso:\nWe're three matches in to Extreme Rules and none of the match stipulations have been extreme, to the point that using a weapon in the current match will cause a DQ. \u2014 Marc Normandin (@Marc_Normandin) July 15, 2018\nWe\u2019re saving up all of the extremeitude for later, I guess.\nOne more Asuka thing: I\u2019m all for Asuka losing matches where the goal is we want to see Carmella get her comeuppance at the hands of Asuka. But this is more like WWE making Asuka look like an ineffectual dork, and that\u2019s not helpful for Asuka nor Carmella!\nFinn Balor vs. The Constable, Baron Corbin\nWe\u2019re getting Balor vs. literal cop Baron Corbin, who has shaved his head and looks significantly better, but also is now more cop-like.\nCorbin is controlling this match, because even though Balor is super fast and agile, Corbin is stupid-fast and agile for someone who is 6-foot-8, and also, he\u2019s 6-foot-8 and strong. Balor is starting to fight back from underneath, but building momentum has been tough against Stephanie McMahon\u2019s personal cop.\nBalor tried to go for a top rope move while Corbin was on the ground, but Corbin got up, grabbed Balor by the throat, and chokeslammed him into a backbreaker. Things are not going well for Finn.\nEverything Balor tries is countered or responded to with extreme prejudice, but he finally snuck in a counter pin when Corbin went for his finisher. Balor gets the 1-2-3 and the surprise victory over Corbin.\nKurt Angle gave Brock Lesnar an ultimatum\nRAW commissioner Kurt Angle just said absentee champion Brock Lesnar needs to show up on Monday\u2019s episode of RAW to talk conditions for defending his title, or else he\u2019ll be stripped of it. My first thought is that this gives Braun Strowman a chance to cash Money in the Bank on him. My second thought is Lesnar refuses to show up and continues to hold the title and call himself the champ whether he\u2019s stripped of it or not.\nWoken Matt Hardy and Bray Wyatt (c) vs. The B Team for the RAW Tag Team Championships\nHuh, this is a surprising opener for Extreme Rules, especially considering WWE has been trying to kick off pay-per-views with some intense matches whose energy will (in theory) carry through the show. Maybe we\u2019re about to see Bo Dallas and Curtis Axel surprise everyone in the arena by getting a lengthy, energetic championship bout against Hardy and Bray.\nIt\u2019s not that this foursome is incapable: it would just be surprising! But a welcome surprise, for sure.\nOh look, there\u2019s Ronda Rousey at ringside, waving the ticket she had to buy around, I wonder if she\u2019ll interfere later on ha ha probably not that never happens. ...Okay I promise I\u2019m not making fun I want Ronda to snap Alexa\u2019s arm off at the elbow later on, this is just a thing you knew was going to happen given her suspension by RAW commissioner Kurt Angle.\nHere we go!\nI\u2019m really excited for Bo Dallas vs. Bray Wyatt, not gonna lie. The real-life brothers are not storyline brothers, but you can definitely tell they\u2019re related when you look at them next to each other. Aw, Bo tagged out after Bray was tagged in so they wouldn\u2019t give the crowd the brother-on-brother violence we all crave.\nWhile this match is slowly getting going, let me just take a second to say fuck Hulk Hogan being reinstated by WWE earlier today. I\u2019m also disappointed in everyone who wrestles for WWE tweeting support for him, but also it\u2019s hard to know if they\u2019re being forced to by their boss.\nAlright, we have a pin attempt by Bo Dallas on Hardy, and Curtis Axel follows up with one of his own on Hardy after being tagged in. This match isn\u2019t very extreme so far, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s only at Extreme Rules, not under extreme rules.\nBo Dallas threw Matt Hardy into Bray Wyatt while they were about to use their tandem finisher, and Wyatt flew out of the ring! Bo pinned Hardy, and The B Team are now the RAW Tag Team champs!\nThat match was about as long as it needed to be, and given the ending, we\u2019ll probably see a rematch that splits Hardy and Bray a little further apart.\nAlright this match was worth it for Curtis Axel to explain how winning the titles made him feel: \u201cHow does it feel? How does a rainbow feel?!\u201d",
    "https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2019/2/19/18231921/manny-machado-contract-padres-prospects": "Half of our long national nightmare is over. Manny Machado, one of the two top prizes on baseball\u2019s free agent market, has signed, and with a somewhat surprising team. Machado landed with the San Diego Padres for an eye-popping $300 million over 10 years. The contract, which was finalized on Thursday, includes an opt-out clause after 2023.\nTerms of the deal were first reported by per Jeff Passan of ESPN and Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic.\nSure, it took until after spring training camps opened throughout baseball for Machado to sign a deal, but the wait it appears was worth it. At $300 million, Machado has the largest free agent deal in baseball history, surpassing the $275 million over 10 years that Alex Rodriguez got from the Yankees after 2007, when MLB\u2019s annual revenue was reported at $6 billion.\nIn 2018, MLB had reported revenues of $10.3 billion, per Forbes.\nThe only contract larger than Machado\u2019s in baseball is the $325 million deal signed by Giancarlo Stanton with the Marlins, though that was a 13-year pact, and one signed before Stanton reached free agency.\nBryce Harper is the other top prize on the market and may or may not surpass $300 million, but for now Machado owns the top free agent contract ever in the sport, which surprisingly puts the Padres in rarefied air.\nEric Hosmer last winter signed an eight-year deal with San Diego for $144 million, giving the Padres for the moment the highest total free agent contracts for two years running. It didn\u2019t work out in 2018 for the Padres, who lost 96 games. San Diego hasn\u2019t had a winning season since 2010, and has averaged a shade under 90 losses in the eight years since.\nBefore Machado the Padres had a payroll of just $80 million for 2019 per Cot\u2019s Contracts, meaning they had plenty of room to add, and frankly still do even after Machado. Maybe if they add some pitching \u2014 Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel are still free agents, after all \u2014 San Diego might accelerate their success even faster.\nBut Hosmer, like Machado, is a long-term play for the Padres, who have one of the most impressive arrays of young talent in the game.\nFernando Tatis Jr. is either the best, second-best or third-best prospect in all of baseball, depending on your national list of choice, a shortstop who figures to reach the big leagues as soon as 2019. Tatis hit .286/.355/.507 with 42 extra-base hits in 88 games in Double-A last year, and he turned just 20 in January. Tatis is one of a whopping eight consensus top-100 prospects in baseball for the Padres, who have three other players who also show up on various national lists.\nPadres top 100 prospects Player Pos 2019 age Baseball America Baseball Prospectus ESPN FanGraphs MLB Pipeline Player Pos 2019 age Baseball America Baseball Prospectus ESPN FanGraphs MLB Pipeline Fernando Tatis Jr. SS 20 2 3 1 3 2 MacKenzie Gore LHP 20 28 28 7 22 15 Luis Urias 2B 22 31 17 56 24 23 Francisco Mejia C 23 32 20 29 59 26 Chris Paddack RHP 23 66 37 44 34 34 Adrian Morejon LHP 20 52 72 46 86 49 Luis Patino RHP 19 67 74 50 42 48 Logan Allen LHP 22 92 84 80 93 74 Michel Baez RHP 23 85 72 Ryan Weathers LHP 19 93 Josh Naylor 1B 22 99\nSan Diego\u2019s prospect capital is so robust, agent Scott Boras last winter called it \u201ca volcano of hot-talent lava.\u201d\n\u201cManny is one of the truly elite players in baseball and impacts the game on both sides of the ball,\u201d Padres general manager A.J. Preller said. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent the last several years building a foundation of talent throughout our system that allows us to make a landmark signing such as this.\u201d\nPretty soon several of these players will be in the majors, and the Padres\u2019 fortunes will turn. Now they get to join a team with a superstar in his prime in Machado.\nMachado gives the Padres a true impact bat in the middle of their lineup, and one who is still just 26 years old. Machado hit .297/.367/.538 with the Orioles and Dodgers in 2018, and his 37 home runs gave him four straight years with at least 33 home runs.\nWhether he plays shortstop or third base in San Diego, Machado will be a huge upgrade. Padres shortstops hit .241/.293/.375, an 82 wRC+ in 2018, ranking 24th in MLB. San Diego third baseman hit .231/.299/.409, a 94 wRC+ that ranked 19th. Machado had a 141 wRC+ last year, and is at 120 for his career.\nMachado will still be in his prime when San Diego starts getting good again, which makes this a perfect fit. Adding great players is never a bad strategy.",
    "https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/french-bank-robber-escapes-prison-via-helicopter": "A successful jailbreak typically requires some sort of highly sophisticated plan to outwit the authorities and get around whatever high-security systems may be in your way. Or, alternately, all it takes is to get a few friends to fly a helicopter into the prison yard and then high-tail it out of there in broad daylight. That's the approach one notorious bank robber took this past weekend when he literally choppered his way out of a French prison, and amazingly enough, it wasn't even the first time he's managed to escape the big house by employing especially clever means.\nRedoine Faid, an infamous French gangster who was serving a 25-year sentence for a botched armed bank robbery that killed a police officer, made the daring escape on Sunday morning after a trio of armed accomplices hijacked a helicopter, landed it in the yard of the Sud-Francilien prison outside Paris, and burst into the building to grab him. The whole operation went down in a matter of minutes, and all while Faid was in a special visitor's area of the jail chatting with his brother who'd come to see him. As of this writing, they're all still on the lam, and there's a massive manhunt underway to catch everyone involved.\nTo pull the whole thing off, the heavily armed accomplices reportedly hijacked a helicopter from an airfield near the prison and forced a flying instructor waiting for a student to assist them. They then landed it in one of the jail's courtyard's, grabbed Faid at gunpoint, and fled to an area nearby where they torched the chopper and hopped into a getaway car. Eventually, they hopped into a different getaway vehicle (torching the first one), and have since evaded authorities. The helicopter pilot was released unharmed, though he did have to go to the hospital to be treated for shock.\nIn the wake of the incident, French Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet traveled to the prison, and described the escape as \"spectacular.\" Interestingly, the courtyards and open-air areas of French prisons are almost all protected with netting to prevent this exact sort of thing from happening after a spate of similar helicopter escapes in the late 2000s. However, there wasn't one installed in this particular one because it was reportedly only used by inmates when they were being admitted or released from the facility.",

Head coach Justin Silverstein doesn\u2019t put much stock in the idea of momentum.\nHis message to the team heading into this week\u2019s NCAA Championship: \u201cWe\u2019ve done great things, but we haven\u2019t been perfect.\u201d\nThe last thing Silverstein wanted was for his players to buy into the notion that these landslide victories meant they\u2019d been playing perfect golf. Mistakes were made, and they\u2019ll continue to be made this week at the Blessings. Expect it. Move on it from it.\nSCORES: NCAA Div. I women\u2019s golf\nPHOTOS: Images from the championship\nThat pre-tournament speech never rang truer than when No. 1 player Jennifer Chang posted a nine on her third hole of the championship. She played the rest of the round in even par on a day when only four players finished in red numbers.\n\u201cThat was a monster effort for us,\u201d said Silverstein.\nThe Trojans have won seven times this season and finished the day at 14-over 306, four shots behind host Arkansas and Texas. The Razorbacks, led by the fiery Maria Fassi, posted six birdies on the final four holes. Fassi played her last 11 holes in 4 under to shoot 72.\nThe Blessings thus far has proven to be a beast of a course with its small landing areas off the tee, big undulating greens and a taxing wind. With players coming into greens that are firm on the first bounce with longer irons, it\u2019s tough to shoot a low number. On the par-73 layout, 66 players failed to break 80 and three couldn\u2019t break 90.\nArizona seniors Bianca Pagdanganan (69) and Haley Moore (72) joined Texas\u2019 Emilee Hoffman and Fassi as the only players to break par.\nPagdanganan finished runner-up at last year\u2019s NCAA championship, where the Wildcats won the team title.\nTexas and Arkansas lead the team race. Both shot 10-over on Friday. Arizona and Stanford at T-3 at 12-over. Duke is fifth at +13 and USC is next at +14.\nSilverstein\u2019s message on Friday night will be one of patience.\nPerhaps one of the most impressive things about USC this season is how deep the lineup is 1-6. USC trounced the field in its last two events and Silverstein still held a 36-hole, match-play qualifier for NCAAs between Allisen Corpuz and Amelia Garvey.\nCorpuz was in the lineup for both conference and regionals, but a share of 55th at the latter made her vulnerable.\nGarvey won the qualifier with a birdie on the second playoff hole at Trump National Los Angeles, hitting driver, pitching wedging on a 490-yard hole.\n\u201cI think you have to expect that kind of competition on the No. 1 team in the country,\u201d said Garvey of fighting her way back in.\nLeaving Corpuz out of the lineup wasn\u2019t easy.\n\u201cHer resume is like a CVS receipt,\u201d joked Silverstein of the player who made national headlines at age 10 when she became the youngest to compete in a USGA championship.\nHow did Garvey respond at the Blessings? She only notched two eagles in an opening 1-over 74, the low round of the day for USC.\n\u201cShe has improved more than anyone this year,\u201d Silverstein said.\nThe field will be cut to 15 teams after the third round, and the top eight advance to match play after 72 holes.",

The lawsuit filed in Palm Beach County on Monday alleges Immesberger was over-served for about three hours after his shift at The Woods concluded, before the fatal crash.\nImmesberger had a history of alcohol abuse, and the lawsuit alleges \u201cTiger knew, or reasonably should have known, that Immesberger was habitually addicted to the use of any or all alcoholic beverages, and/or was a habitual drunkard.\u201d\nTuesday, Woods was asked about the case during his pre-PGA Championship news conference.

Woods, under state alcohol laws, potentially could be held liable as an owner of the establishment even if he wasn\u2019t physically at the venue if a foreseeable risk of injury or death occurs due to over-serving.\n\u201cThe employees and management at The Woods had direct knowledge that Immesberger had a habitual problem with alcohol,\u201d the lawsuit read. \u201cIn fact, employees and managers knew that Immesberger had attended Alcoholic Anonymous meetings prior to the night of his crash and was attempting to treat his disease. Despite this, the employees and management at The Woods continued to serve Immesberger alcohol while he was working as well as after work, while he sat at the bar.\u201d\nA news conference is scheduled for Tuesday morning.",
    "https://golfweek.usatoday.com/2018/09/23/19th-hole-fedex-cup-changes-could-drain-the-drama-out-of-playoffs/": "The FedEx Cup will be better going forward. And the season-long PGA Tour \u201cplayoffs\u201d will still live under expectations compared to all other sports.\nYes, Steve Sands will go back to interviewing players instead of explaining mind-numbing projections. A hard-working algorithm can finally take a long-awaited vacation, likely never to visit East Lake again. With the scoring relegated to one leaderboard featuring a built-in 10-under-par advantage for the Cup leader, fans and players will have a competition they can easily follow.\nIf all goes well and the new format survives, the conclusion to the PGA Tour season should be compelling enough to watch most years. But the Tour Championship, now just a FedEx Cup concluding tournament adding a season-long excellence bias, will be missing the core component of any great playoff: rejection.\nThe new FedEx Cup borrows a guiding and fatal flaw of its predecessor in resisting rejection by trying to influence on-the-field play. Yet America loves winners but secretly adores watching how others handle losing. The PGA Tour says it\u2019s all about fan engagement these days, but the millions who tune into reality shows or playoffs in other sports also enjoy the process of elimination.\n\u201cJay [Monahan] referenced how involved our players and the membership has been throughout the process,\u201d said the PGA Tour\u2019s Andy Pazdur. \u201cTo have the overwhelming support for this new system that we have received from the players has been just fantastic.\u201d\nActually, player support is not always fantastic.\nHad this been up to fans, some players or media, the playoffs would eventually let go of protecting season-long play and turned the players loose to decide the FedEx Cup. Gasp! Upsets might occur. Rejections in the form of a Tour Championship cut could have created shocking twists. Fans would have been more engaged by the possibility of an upset.\nImagine a simple scenario in which the PGA Tour retained four days of Tour Championship play by keeping the hard-working algorithm in business a few days longer while also deciding a legitimate tournament. Then send the final six FedEx Cup leaders to a fifth day with an 18- or 36-hole shootout for the new first prize of $15 million that anyone can follow.\n\u201cI would say that internally, we had a lot of discussion about a format like that, coming down to 18 holes or coming down to 36 holes, whether you were four or six players, and we brought that forward,\u201d Monahan said.\nYou know where this is going: Over-coddled players said no to losing even though everyone at East Lake goes home with a big bonus check.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t get a whole lot of traction on those concepts just because players felt like \u2013 you look at the FedEx Cup and the fact that I\u2019m battling from the Safeway Open to the Wyndham Championship, I make my way into the playoffs, and it\u2019s going to come down to an 18-hole shootout?\u201d\nYes, actually. Or 36 holes with a cut after the first 18? We could watch a couple of players head to the parking lot, salute them for a valiant effort and know they are still a few million dollars richer thanks to $70 million in the new bonus pool from FedEx and Wyndham.\nFans criticized the new format on social media by making clear more money does not pique their interest. They want memorable and compelling playoffs in which the winner is decided on the field. Sometimes, regular-season form does not translate to Game 7 success. Upstarts and upsets make great theater. Then the money becomes compelling.\n\u201cThe proper way to do this is ultimately where we ended up,\u201d said Monahan, \u201cwhich is let\u2019s make it opaque, everybody understands where they are coming in.\u201d\nSo while the FedEx Cup is much easier to follow, the overriding principle plaguing the playoffs in the previous iteration lives on by rewarding season-long excellence until the very end, even at the risk of a runaway snoozefest.\nTo engage fans, the final outcome has to be decided on the course free of algorithms and strokes-based systems. The PGA Tour\u2019s executive ranks delivered huge bonus increases and in return should have told top players that with such riches comes a possibility of being voted off the island, fired and sent home a whopping one day early.\nBecause if someone is playing the golf of their life over the course of three weeks and sneaks in to win the big prize, life will go on. There is nothing opaque about the excitement such a playoff could produce. Gwk",

    "https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-the-long-process-to-get-led-zeppelins-music-in-hbo-sharp-objects-2018-8": "HBO's limited series \"Sharp Objects\" uniquely features four songs from legendary 1970s rock and roll band, Led Zeppelin.\nThe show's music supervisor, Susan Jacobs, tells Business Insider about the months-long process to gain the rights to the music.\nFor decades, countless filmmakers have abandoned the hope of featuring the music of rock gods Led Zeppelin in their work because the legend is true: It\u2019s really, really hard to get the band to grant permission.\nBut Zeppelin continues to get requests because when the band does say \"yes,\" the scenes can become iconic. Amy Heckerling\u2019s 1982 classic \u201cFast Times at Ridgemont High\u201d famously got the band\u2019s okay to use \u201cKashmir\u201d in one scene (it might have helped that the movie\u2019s screenwriter, Cameron Crowe, used to cover the band for Rolling Stone). Recently, Adam McKay\u2019s \u201cThe Big Short\u201d was able to get \u201cWhen the Levee Breaks\u201d in its trailer and the movie\u2019s end credits.\nBecause Zeppelin needle drops are so hard to come by, it makes the incredible use of the band\u2019s music on the HBO limited series \u201cSharp Objects\u201d so special. And you can thank the show's veteran music supervisor Susan Jacobs for pulling it off.\nJacobs is no stranger to clearing Zeppelin. She did it for two David O. Russell movies (\u201cThe Fighter\u201d and \u201cSilver Linings Playbook\u201d) before her latest collaboration with \u201cSharp Objects\u201d director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e (\u201cBig Little Lies\u201d). But just because she did it before didn\u2019t mean getting the songs for the show was easy.\nLed Zeppelin. Warner Bros.\nSimply put: \u201cYou never go into Led Zeppelin assuming you\u2019re getting Led Zeppelin,\u201d Jacobs said.\nBased on Gillian Flynn\u2019s debut novel, \u201cSharp Objects\u201d follows newspaper journalist Camille Preaker (played by Amy Adams) who returns to her hometown to report on a series of murders. However, the assignment brings memories of her troubled past, and matched with her dependency to alcohol, it leads her into a tailspin.\nVall\u00e9e uses moody Zeppelin songs \u201cIn the Evening,\u201d \u201cWhat Is And What Should Never Be,\u201d \u201cThank You,\u201d and \u201cI Can\u2019t Quit You, Baby\u201d as a way to delve into Camille\u2019s psyche, but the songs are also her escape hatch when things are getting too out of hand, as she plays the music constantly through a beat-up iPhone.\nThe use of Zeppelin is one of the biggest additions Vall\u00e9e made to his adaptation of Flynn\u2019s novel, as the band is not mentioned at all in the book. However, the unique guitar sounds of Jimmy Page and howls of Robert Plant feel essential to the story.\nJacobs said that was the intention Vall\u00e9e had when he asked her to try to clear Zeppelin long before production began on \u201cSharp Objects\u201d (typically music supervisors begin working on movies and TV shows toward the end of production or the start of post production). He wanted the band specifically because Camille\u2019s story needed an epic sound.\n\u201cIt had to be a band very substantial to be felt across generations,\u201d Jacobs told Business Insider. \u201cIt had to have that depth and honesty.\u201d\nNo begging and pleading allowed\nJacobs has been working with Vall\u00e9e since his 2014 movie \u201cWild,\u201d and his love for meaty soundtracks in his work has only become more refined since, as evident in his previous HBO project, the 8-time Emmy-winning \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d (Jacobs won an Emmy for music supervision on the show). So she knew that Vall\u00e9e\u2019s Zeppelin ask clearly wasn\u2019t just to play a song or two in the background of scenes. And that led to the first hurdle for Jacobs: how to start the conversation with Warner/Chappel, the publisher of the band\u2019s songs.\n\u201cCrafting the pitch for me can be three weeks of solid trying to write the right letter,\u201d she said.\nA music supervisor\u2019s role in trying to get music rights is partly keeping the filmmaker happy, but also the music publishers and artists. Jacobs called herself a \u201cmarriage broker\u201d in the experience.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s about putting in a lot of time and making really clear what you are asking for and why you\u2019re asking for it, why is that song important?\u201d she said.\nSusan Jacobs. Getty\nAnd with Zeppelin it took months to pull off.\nJacobs said there were numerous pitches, which stated some specifics of what \u201cSharp Objects\u201d was about and listing the key cast and director involved, as well as the songs they wanted (which were the ones that ended up in the show). And it wasn\u2019t just one, she had to send pitches for each level of approvals she got through. After that, it became a waiting game.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t begging and pleading and banging on the doors, it took a long time,\u201d said Jacobs, who declined to divulge how much it cost to clear the songs.\nJacobs said one of the big keys was that she was dealing with someone on the publishing side who knew Vall\u00e9e\u2019s work. Wendy Christiansen, the senior VP of film and TV music at Warner/Chappel, had direct contact with the band and made them understand that the music would be in good hands. Vall\u00e9e and Jacobs needed a voice like that because there was nothing to show the band of how the music would be used.\nJacobs had started the talks so early on that much of the negotiations were going on during preproduction and the shooting of the show. It wasn\u2019t until the editing of the episodes began that Zeppelin finally agreed to clear the songs.\nUsing Zeppelin to guide someone in pain\nJacobs said there are 23 uses of the four Led Zeppelin songs in \u201cSharp Objects,\u201d but you\u2019d have to have a good ear to catch them all.\nIn some episodes there may be a faint three-second sampling of a single song, in others there may be a few verses of multiple songs throughout. Vall\u00e9e made Zeppelin almost another character in the story.\nAccording to Jacobs, Vall\u00e9e wanted Zeppelin in the show because the band\u2019s music got him through the tough times of his youth. He felt many watching the show would relate.\n\u201cI can think of hundreds of others who I can put in a room and say the same thing,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cFor many of us, our teen years, without Led Zeppelin those years would have been a whole lot rougher.\u201d\nAnd as we learned in the \u201cFix\u201d episode, the band\u2019s music became an important part of Camille\u2019s life in one of her low points. In flashback scenes, we learn that Camille went to rehab before going back to her hometown at the start of the series. There she became friends with her roommate Alice, who constantly played Zeppelin songs on her phone. Like Alice, Zeppelin became Camille\u2019s escape from the world. At the end of the episode, Camille discovers Alice\u2019s body after she has committed suicide. Camille moves forward with her life with the help of the Zeppelin songs Alice introduced to her. The songs would become as prevalent to her as the scars we see all over her body as the show evolves.\n(L-R) Alice (Sydney Sweeney) and Camille (Amy Adams) in the \"Fix\" episode of \"Sharp Objects.\" Anne Maris Fox/HBO\nJacobs said she never explained in her pitches to Zeppelin the way Vall\u00e9e would use their music, though she did hint that the music would play a big part in the life of a character who is dealing with a lot of pain.\n\u201cThey were on board with that,\u201d she said. \u201cThey really understood the role music has in the guiding of someone who is in trouble.\u201d\nBut what would have happened if Zeppelin didn\u2019t give permission for the music to be used?\nJacobs said they would have had to move on to another substantial band, perhaps The Rolling Stones, she said. But she admits she and Vall\u00e9e never had to have a serious talk about a plan B.\nThough Jacobs has once again been successful in getting Zeppelin for a project, she admitted there\u2019s still so much mystery every time she attempts it. She said she has no relationship with the band, in fact, she has no idea if the band members have seen \u201cSharp Objects,\u201d or any of the movies where she\u2019s used their music.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t really asked and they aren\u2019t ones to say,\u201d Jacobs said with a laugh. \u201cJimmy [Page] lives off the grid, whether he\u2019s got a TV set or whether he cares I don\u2019t know. But I do think they care about young people being exposed to their music, and this did that.\u201d\n\u201cSharp Objects\u201d airs Sundays on HBO.",

The 50-over tournament features six teams. Here\u2019s all you need to know about the tournament:\nWho are the participating teams and what is the format?\nThe six participating teams are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Hong Kong. The teams are split into two groups. Group A consists of India, Pakistan and Hong Kong while Group B has Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Each team plays the other in the same group once. The top two teams from each group will qualify for the second stage, called the Super Four.\nThe four teams in this stage will play each other once. The top two will qualify for the final in Dubai on September 28.\nThe tournament reverts to the 50-over format. The previous edition, in 2016, was played as a Twenty20 tournament, in order to prepare the teams for the ICC World T20 that followed after the tournament. This time though the change in the format should help the teams (save for Hong Kong) prepare for the 50-over World Cup in England next year.\nWhat happened at the qualifying tournament?\nWith India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan having sealed their spots, for the sixth spot, the 2018 Asia Cup Qualifier tournament was held in Malaysia from August 29 to September 6, 2018. The participating teams were Hong Kong, UAE, Malaysia, Oman, Nepal, Malaysia and Singapore. UAE topped the group with 8 points while Hong Kong came second. The two teams qualified for the final.\nRain reduced the final to 24 overs a side. UAE managed 176 for 9 batting first. Hong Kong sneaked through by two wickets in the final over to seal their qualification for the main tournament.\nWhat is the status of Hong Kong\u2019s matches?\nHong Kong doesn\u2019t have official one-day international status. The team had earlier lost its ODI status after finishing poorly in the (50-over) World Cup Qualifiers earlier this year. However, the ICC has confirmed that all of Hong Kong\u2019s matches in the 2018 Asia Cup will be recognised as official one-day internationals.\nWhat is India and Pakistan\u2019s head-to-head record in the Asia Cup?\nSince the tournament\u2019s inception in 1984, India and Pakistan have played each other 12 times, with India winning 6 (5 ODIs plus 1 T20) and losing 5. In the 2018 edition, there is the prospect of the two sides meeting up to three times, first in the group stage, at the Super Four and the final, should they finish in the top two.\nSchedule\nGroup Stage\nSeptember 15: Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka\nSeptember 16: Pakistan vs Hong Kong\nSeptember 17: Sri Lanka vs Afghanistan\nSeptember 18: India vs Hong Kong\nSeptember 19: India vs Pakistan\nSeptember 20: Bangladesh vs Afghanistan\nSuper Four\nSeptember 21: Group A winner vs Group B runner-up\nSeptember 21: Group B winner vs Group A runner-up\nSeptember 23: Group A winner vs Group A runner-up\nSeptember 23: Group B Winner vs Group B runner-up\nSeptember 25: Group A winner vs Group B winner\nSeptember 26: Group A runner-up vs Group B runner-up\nSeptember 28: Final",

The combination has a lot going for it \u2013 Rajesh\u2019s liking for light-hearted sequences, the ones that we still diligently watch on television, was always going to be a good match with Sivakarthikeyan\u2019s sensibilities.\nMr Local, the recent offering to come out of this happy marriage, is filled with things that we expect . The issue is that it does only that.\nManohar (Sivakarthikeyan) is not very different from Rajesh\u2019s earlier protagonists Siva ( Siva Manasula Sakthi ), and Baskaran ( Boss Engira Baskaran ), except for the fact that he has a job. He works in what looks to be a posh car company, but his environs are still very middle-class. Back home, he still wears a lungi and jovially fights with his sister.\nBut that is not the brawl that Mr Local wants to focus on. Its intention is to zoom in on the Tom-and-Jerry-like relationship between Manohar and Keerthana (Nayanthara) \u2013 one that kickstarts in the most likeliest of places: the traffic signal. It\u2019s a sign, I suppose, of things to come \u2013 Mr Local is as predictable as we thought it would be.\nMr Local Genre: Comedy\nCast: Sivakarthikeyan, Nayanthara, Radhikaa, Yogi Babu\nStoryline: What happens when a middle-class man clashes with a rich CEO?\nBut that is not such a bad thing, especially when we have Yogi Babu and Satish holding fort in the first half and dishing out some admittedly-funny hero\u2019s-best-friend comedy lines. Robo Shankar is wasted, but the other two ensure that we don\u2019t miss Santhanam, one of the highlights in most of Rajesh\u2019s films.\nThe director might have done well to focus on the comedy, because when he gets into serious zone \u2013 the tiff-off between the lead pair, and the subsequent romance \u2013 it starts trailing off. Mr Local tries to keep the stars as equals, but it never comes off that way...Sivakarthikeyan, thanks to his goofy expressions, always scores a tad more than Nayanthara, who ends up looking stiff and uptight. Radhikaa, however, scores as a very-relatable mother to Sivakarthikeyan \u2013 watching her play a character obsessed with TV soaps does bring a smile to your face.\nSivakarthikeyan\u2019s presence just about manages to hold Mr Local together. It\u2019s a near-perfect film for him \u2013 one that rides more on his dialogue delivery rather than emotion and action (when will filmmakers ditch the two mandatory fight sequences that just exists for the heck of it?). He seems to have worked on his dancing skills as well \u2013 there are some neat steps in the Hip Hop Adhi-composed \u2018Kalakkal\u2019 and \u2018Takkunu Takkunu\u2019 numbers \u2013 but the songs are all just fillers and contribute little to carry the story forward, which was anyway wafer-thin in the first place.",

Each decision was unanimous and the deliberations took just one hour. The manner of death will now be entered by the county onto each one of their official death certificates.\nThe four options presented to the jury were: natural, suicide, accident, and \"at the hands of another, other than by accident,\" which the sheriff clarified is homicide.\nIn some of the final testimony of the day, California Highway Patrol Officer Jake Slates said, \"Ultimately, I feel that based on Sarah and Jen's history, the pattern of alleged abuse, that this was just another case where they ran.\"\nSlates believes the women had not yet totally decided on the suicide plan while Googling about methods on Saturday or while they were buying groceries at Safeway or toiletries at Dollar Tree on Sunday morning. At some point, Slates says, while driving along the coast in their final day, they decided to commit to the plan. That \"if they couldn't have those kids, then nobody was going to have those kids.\"\nMendocino County Sheriff Lt. Shannon Barney echoed Slates' conclusion on the stand: \"It is my belief that both Jennifer and Sarah succumbed to a lot of pressure ... to the point they made a conscious decision to end their lives and to take the children with them.\"\nORIGINAL STORY:\nLast September Glamour reported on the tragic story of the Harts\u2014mothers Jennifer and Sarah Hart and their six adopted children. On social media Jen Hart portrayed the image of a happy, postracial American family, but what was going on inside their Woodland, Washington, home turned out to be something very different.\nJen, Sarah, and their children Markis, 19, Hannah, 16, Devonte, 15, Abigail, 14, Jeremiah, 14, and Sierra, 12 (two sets of black biological siblings) were often referred to as the Hart Tribe. But on March 26, 2018, their car was found at the bottom of a cliff off California's Highway 1.\nIn the coroner\u2019s inquest today at the Willitts Justice Center in Willitts, California, investigators have revealed the timeline of what happened in the family\u2019s final hours. Among the new details revealed in testimony today was exactly what was in the system of each family member when the Yukon plummeted off the cliff. Evidence presented showed that many members of the family were most likely heavily sedated, with Sarah, who investigators say was in the passenger seat, having the equivalent of 42 single doses of diphenhydramine, a Benadryl-like drug, in her system.\nJennifer was driving\u2014and was legally drunk\u2014but didn\u2019t show signs of having taken diphenhydramine. Investigators revealed that the family had purchased an Equate-branded version at a Walmart in Washington State shortly after leaving their house on March 23, 2018, before continuing down the Pacific coast. Both liquid and pill versions of the drug were found in the family\u2019s car.",

Less than a day after a U.K. tabloid claimed that Johnny Depp, 55, allegedly accused his ex Amber Heard of leaving doo-doo in their bed, the actress is reeling from the gossip. The 32-year-old is said to be \u201cdisgusted\u201d by the story, which ran in the Daily Mirror on Aug. 15. According to the claims, Johnny allegedly accused his then wife Amber of deliberately leaving human poop in their bed to spite him for being late to her 30th birthday party in April 2016. Slamming the report, her rep told the newspaper that the blonde\u2019s dog, Boo, who has \u201cserious bowel control issues,\u201d was the culprit. Now we\u2019re learning exactly what the actress feels about the whole mess.\n\u201cAmber is just disgusted that Johnny would leak this stupid story to the press,\u201d a source close to the star EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife, while alleging that the actor was the source of the gossip. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that he\u2019s incapable of moving on even though they\u2019ve settled their divorce and she wants nothing more to do with him. Johnny is clearly still trying to humiliate and embarrass Amber, but she\u2019s over playing his games. Their marriage turned really toxic, and it\u2019s a time of her life that Amber wants to just put behind her for good. She wishes that Johnny would have the good grace to do the same.\u201d\nThe person adds, \u201cAmber vehemently denies pooping in their bed, even the idea of her doing that is utterly insane. It\u2019s just not something she would ever do. Johnny has been obsessed with the fact that it was Amber, ever since the incident happened, and he would never listen to reason, or believe Amber when she swore it wasn\u2019t her.\u201d\nAs fans of the Pirates Of the Caribbean star know, Amber and Johnny married in 2015, but divorced two years later after she publicly accused him of physically assaulting her \u2013 an allegation he denied. He clearly still has many loyal supporters out there, because \u2013 soon after the Mirror\u2019s poo-gate story was published \u2013 Amber\u2019s Instagram page was embarrassingly flooded with poop emojis. But will the reaction prompt her to delete her account?\nAnother insider tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY, \u201cAmber is so upset over the claims she pooped in Johnny\u2019s bed that she even considered quitting social media over it. She\u2019s seen the comments and emojis and they are very hurtful and since she is a very emotional person she is taking these attacks very hard.\u201d The person adds, \u201cIt really is throwing her emotions in a tailspin.

Amazon acquired Twitch for $970 million in 2014, for instance, while Viacom just purchased AwesomenessTV for a bargain price of roughly $50 million.\nAT&T finalized in June its much-ballyhooed $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner \u2014 which owns HBO, Turner, and Warner Bros. (which in turn owns digital gaming network Machinima). Chernin Group founder Peter Chernin (pictured above) tells the Times that AT&T will likely fold Otter into this growing entertainment portfolio.

A court ruled that AT&T could move forward with the acquisition in June, although the federal government has since appealed that ruling. Many have speculated that President Donald Trump is personally seeking to subvert the deal due to his hatred of Time Warner property CNN.\nTony Goncalves, an AT&T veteran who was named CEO of Otter Media in February \u2014 and who will report to Stankey \u2014 declined to comment on Otter\u2019s profitability. \u201cYou\u2019ll see a good amount of cross-pollination, where some of that really wonderful Warner intellectual property and content will find its way into the businesses that are part of the Otter portfolio today,\u201d Goncalves told the Times of Otter\u2019s integration into WarnerMedia.\nAs for Chernin\u2019s next steps, the Times reports that the noted media executive is currently looking to raise $500 million to invest in next-gen media companies. \u201cI think we will continue to do a version of what we do, which is make movies and television shows, and we will look to continue to invest in consumer technology brands,\u201d he told the paper.",

    "https://www.slashgear.com/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-foldable-teases-future-of-ultraportable-laptops-13576458/": "Lenovo ThinkPad X1 foldable teases future of ultraportable laptops\nLenovo has just unveiled one of its most incredible devices to date: a foldable Windows-based PC designed for business executives, on-the-go professionals, and anyone who wants to be on the cutting edge of technology. The foldable will be part of the company's popular ThinkPad X1 family when it arrives on the market next year, offering buyers a device with a flexible display that can function as their primary PC.\nLenovo has kicked off its presence in the foldables market in a big way with its new ThinkPad foldable PC prototype. The Windows-based device will feature a foldable OLED screen from LG Display; it has a 2K resolution and 4:3 aspect ratio, measures 9.6-inches in half-screen, and 13.3-inches for the full screen.\nThe device utilizes Intel technology and includes a number of notable features, the incredible display aside, including stereo speakers, a pair of USB-C ports, and an infrared camera. In addition to a Bluetooth keyboard, the device will also provide users with a Wacom pen for times when a stylus is ideal. Buyers can expect all-day battery life on a single charge.\nThe foldable ThinkPad X1 device will be able to replace your laptop to serve as your primary PC, according to Lenovo. The device sports a torque hinge that enables the screen to be positioned at various angles in the same way a traditional laptop screen can be positioned at the ideal angle. Lenovo avoided any potential issues related to top-heaviness by using the battery to add weight to the bottom part of the device.\nBuyers can expect the same level of quality they get from other ThinkPad devices; in fact, Lenovo anticipates users frequently folding and unfolding the device, which is why it doubled the hinge cycles it uses to test its laptop products. The new foldable is the result of three years of development, giving us our first look at the future of highly portable laptops.\nLenovo will offer more details on the device, including availability, in the future.",

Scientists discovered the six-foot-wide asteroid just hours before it reached Earth.\nNASA tracks 90 percent of near-Earth objects that are larger than 150 meters (~460 feet) in diameter, which means it misses lots of the smaller ones until they\u2019re close by. This most recent rock, called 2018 LA, was spotted on June 2 by the Catalina Sky Survey in Arizona. At that point, the asteroid was almost as near as the moon, according to a release. Researchers realized it was on a collision course with Earth, and were able to predict a few locations over a large swath of the planet\u2019s surface. Followup observations allowed astronomers to pinpoint a probable collision with southern Africa.\nA rock entered the atmosphere traveling around 38,000 miles per hour at 6:44 pm Botswana time, creating a fireball, lining up with the predictions.\nAdvertisement\nHere\u2019s a video:\nThis rock, like every small asteroid that hits or flies close by the Earth only a short time after its detection, confirms what we always say about asteroids. When scientists talk about \u201cpotentially hazardous\u201d asteroids, they\u2019re referring to bigger ones that have a chance to hit Earth eventually, but not in the foreseeable future. The asteroids that do hit Earth, such as 2018 LA, typically occur with little to no warning.\nG/O Media may get a commission 10% off 10% off Wish A gift for literally everybody.\nGifts under $20, $10, and even $5.

    "https://gizmodo.com/asus-rog-phone-looks-like-the-wildest-gaming-phone-yet-1826533982": "What started as an experiment to bring gaming features to the mobile world has now become a full-on trend. Last year, Razer introduced a phone with flagship specs and a high refresh rate display. Then, Nubia upped the ante by adding RGB lighting to its Red Magic handset. And now Asus has topped them all with the wildly ambitious but simply named ROG Phone.\nSporting a 6-inch 90Hz AMOLED screen and a glowing ROG logo with customizable lighting in the back, this upcoming phone has the highlight features from its predecessors covered, and Asus didn\u2019t stop there. The company crammed in vapor-chamber cooling (a feature normally reserved for gaming laptops), three USB-C ports (more on those later), and special touch-sensitive sides that can function as shoulder buttons while in landscape mode, or used to turn on the phone\u2019s gaming mode by simply squeezing the device.\nOn the inside, Asus blew out the device\u2019s specs with 8GB of RAM, up to 512GB of storage, a big \u2018ole 4,000 mAH battery, and an overclocked Snapdragon 845 chip that can hit 2.96Ghz instead of Qualcomm\u2019s usual 2.8Ghz max. The ROG Phone even supports 802.11 WiGig connectivity, so you can stream gameplay wirelessly to a nearby TV or monitor using Asus\u2019 companion WiGig Dock. In short, the ROG Phone might just be the most powerful Android phone on the planet.\nAdvertisement\nNow back to those extra USB-C ports. When looking at the phone in portrait mode, there\u2019s one USB-C port (and a handy headphone jack) down at the bottom for typical stuff like charging and data transfer. But then on the sides of the device, there are two more USB-C ports so that when you\u2019re gaming, you can hold the phone in landscape mode and still have somewhere to plug in a power cable without messing up your grip.\nG/O Media may get a commission 10% off 10% off Wish A gift for literally everybody.\nGifts under $20, $10, and even $5. It\u2019s Wish, the catch-all shop for all of the above. Buy at Wish Advertisement\nI\u2019m a big fan of the idea, because in a world where a lot of mainstream phone makers are ditching the headphone jack, putting two or more USB-C ports on the device is a simple and also utilitarian way of letting people connect multiple accessories so you can do things like recharge your device and use headphones at the same time. And for the ROG Phone, Asus has even more ambitious things in mind for use with USB-C.\nHere\u2019s the back of Asus\u2019 AeroActiveCooler, which has an extra USB-C port and a headphone jack. Image : Asus Another shot of the AeroActive Cooler Image : Asus If you don\u2019t look close, you might think this is a Nintendo Switch, but it\u2019s not.

Image : Asus 1 / 8\nAdvertisement\nIn addition to Asus\u2019 WiGig Dock mentioned above, which features a boatload of ports and lets you turn the phone into a desktop of sorts similar to a Samsung Dex, Asus has created three more gaming add-ons for the ROG Phone.\nThe first is a cooling dock with a built-in fan that attaches to the bottom and back of the phone to help keep your hands dry and temps down even during the most intense mobile gaming sessions. Then there\u2019s a pair of gamepads that slip onto either side of the phone and turn the device into something like a mini Nintendo Switch. But the thing I want to try the most is Asus\u2019 TwinView Dock, which adds extra battery capacity and an entire second screen to the ROG Phone.\nAdvertisement\nI\u2019m not even sure what games or titles are supposed to take advantage of that second screen (and judging by its call to developers, I don\u2019t think Asus knows either), but it seems like Asus took a look at the most popular Nintendo handhelds of the last decade and said, \u201cWe can do that, too.\u201d\nSo despite not having an official price or release date (Asus says it\u2019s hoping for a release sometime in the third quarter of this year), the ROG Phone is exciting, ambitious, and the best example of why I\u2019ve been pumped about how gaming phones could change the mobile world as a whole. Asus, don\u2019t let me down.",
    "https://blogs.fangraphs.com/national-league-draft-recap/": "Click here for American League recap.\nBelow is a collection of notes on each National League team\u2019s draft class. We\u2019ve tried to touch briefly on the players each club selected through the first five rounds or so, with observations on players selected after that at our discretion. Generally, these are the prospects we think both (a) have a chance to appear on a team prospect list sometime in the near future and also (b) are likely to sign. The number in parentheses after each player\u2019s name is the round in which he was drafted.\nFor more details on many of these players, consult THE BOARD, which has tool grades, links to video, and various information about the players.\nArizona Diamondbacks\nLink to Draft Selections\nSoCal prep 2B Matt McLain (1) is a smaller guy with a plus hit tool and the speed/hands to play somewhere up the middle\u2026 Virginia CF Jake McCarthy (CBA) missed most of the spring with a broken wrist but has average raw power, plus speed, and feel to hit, though he\u2019ll need a swing adjustment in pro ball\u2026 Illinois prep CF Alek Thomas (2) has a long track record of hitting and has good feel for the game but slipped because of concerns about a lack of physicality. That won\u2019t matter if he hits like proponents think he will\u2026 Kansas RHP Jackson Goddard (3) is a power arm who flashes electric stuff and likely lands in relief\u2026 Wright State RHP Ryan Weiss (4) shows solid-average stuff, has a back-end-starter profile\u2026 Oregon RHP Matt Mercer (5) is a Driveline guy who throws with high effort up to 97 mph. He has four pitches, but the changeup is way ahead of the breaking balls and he may end up in relief\u2026 Florida prep RHP Levi Kelly (8) is maxed out and is a fringe athlete, but he\u2019s up to 96 mph and flashes a plus slider at times\u2026 Florida State LHP Tyler Holton (9) had Tommy John surgery this spring but flashed solid-average stuff and feel when healthy\u2026 Florida prep SS Blaze Alexander (11) has power, a 70 arm, and a chance to play shortstop but has had swing-and-miss issues against good pitching\u2026 Kentucky RHP Justin Lewis (12) is ultra lanky, sitting 89-93 mph with an above-average changeup and enough breaking ball to stick as a starter.\nAtlanta Braves\nLink to Draft Selections\nFlorida prep RHP Carter Stewart (1) has a chance for two 70 pitches in his fastball and curve, along with the starter traits, projection, and athleticism to project to the front of a rotation\u2026 Wichita State RF/1B Greyson Jenista (2) has sneaky athleticism and 65-grade raw power from the left side that could produce 30 bombs a year. He\u2019ll need a swing adjustment, though, and there\u2019s some risk that changing him hurts his ability to make contact\u2026 Stanford RHP Tristan Beck (4) was a first-round talent in high school but has been injured a lot since his senior year. He now has four pitches, the best of which is his curveball, and inconsistent command. He has third- or fourth-starter upside if things bounce back\u2026 Junior college RHP Trey Riley (5) transferred from Oklahoma State and his stuff ticked up, hitting 97. He\u2019ll flash an above-average slider and has a chance to start\u2026 UNC Greensboro CF Andrew Moritz (6) has fringe physical tools but a great feel to hit\u2026 Stetson closer Brooks Wilson (7) is a senior sign with three solid-average pitches and comes right at hitters\u2026 Washington SS A.J. Graffanino (8) is the son of Tony Graffanino and is super lanky and smooth at short. He has limited power and was injured much of this year but has some feel to hit\u2026 Texas RHP Nolan Kingham (12) looked like a first-round pick as a freshman and has been up to 97 mph but has been very inconsistent\u2026 California prep RHP Victor Vodnik (14) is just 6-foot even and looked like a young Trevor Bauer last fall, up to 97 mph with a 55 breaking ball and a quick, efficient arm action. He sat closer to 90 mph this spring, though\u2026 1B C.J. Alexander (20) is the older brother of D-backs 11th-rounder Blaze Alexander. He has plus raw power and posted big numbers this spring.\nChicago Cubs\nLink to Draft Selections\nStanford 2B Nico Hoerner (1) has plus-plus speed, great bat-to-ball ability, and sneaky power, but it\u2019s unclear what up-the-middle position he plays and he doesn\u2019t lift the ball much\u2026 Arizona prep CF Brennen Davis (2) is a classic power/speed lottery ticket with lots of risk on the contact\u2026 SoCal prep CF Cole Roederer (comp 2) had a late injury that dried up his market a bit, but he has great feel to hit and a shot to stay in center\u2026 San Diego RHP Paul Richan (comp 2) was likely an underslot play to sign the prep outfielders, has solid-average stuff and some moxie as a back-end/up-and-down type\u2026 Duke CF Jimmy Herron (3) has a football background and plus speed but a very flat swing path with little power\u2026 Virginia 2B Andy Weber (5) has an advanced feel to hit and is decent at second base, lacks power\u2026 Liberty CF D.J. Artis (7) has a very patient approach and is a plus runner who can play center but not a whole lot else. The Cubs draft someone like this every year\u2026 Virginia RHP Derek Casey (9) is a favorite senior sign of ours, with a good frame and good delivery. He also throws strikes and has average stuff\u2026 Southern Miss 3B Luke Reynolds (9) put up big numbers this year and could turn into a corner utility type\u2026 Louisville RHP Riley Thompson (11) has a truly electric arm, running his heater up to 99 mph, but the command and consistency have never been there. Mitchell Parker (28) is a prep lefty from New Mexico with upper-80s stuff, which plays better due to deception, and a good curveball.\nCincinnati Reds\nLink to Draft Selections\nFlorida 3B Jonathan India (1) was a third- to fourth-rounder entering the year, but remade his body and dominated the SEC this spring with improved tools\u2026 Florida prep RHP Lyon Richardson (2) is maxed-out physically and some don\u2019t love his arm action, but he\u2019s got a really live arm and has been up to 96 mph this spring with a 55 slider and other starter traits\u2026 Le Moyne RHP Josiah Gray (2) is a D2 conversion guy who pounds the zone with a plus fastball. His secondaries are raw \u2026 Illinois RF Bren Spillane (3) put up monster numbers and has plus, all-fields raw power along with enough athleticism to try the outfield\u2026 Virginia prep CF Mike Siani (4) will sign for well over slot as a fringe first-round talent with four above-average tools\u2026 UC Santa Barbara RHP Noah Davis (11) looked like a second-rounder this fall, hitting 97 mph with his sinker and showing starter traits, but had Tommy John last month\u2026 Florida RHP Michael Byrne (14) will be a tough sign, as there\u2019s talk of him shifting from the Gators closer role into their rotation next year, where his solid-average stuff may play better than it did in one-inning stints. He may make himself some money\u2026 UCF 1B Rylan Thomas (26) is squatty with explosive hands that create 65 or 70 raw power. He has a 60 arm but his feet limits him to first, and his power-based approach gives him some trouble with good breaking stuff.\nColorado Rockies\nLink to Draft Selections\nOle Miss LHP Ryan Rolison (1) looked like a top-10 pick after a few outings this spring, but then he struggled with fastball command (which might be fixable if it\u2019s just a stride-direction issue) and coaches didn\u2019t encourage him to use his changeup\u2026 New Hampshire prep 1B Grant Lavigne (CBA) has easy plus raw power and a really good swing, and they need to bear serious fruit because he\u2019s likely first-base-only\u2026 Texas A&M RHP Mitchell Kilkenny (2) doesn\u2019t have a sexy profile, but he\u2019s an effective back-end-starter type with solid-average stuff who\u2019ll hit 95 mph every now and then\u2026 Minnesota 3B Terrin Vavra (3) performs when healthy and has about average tools across the board\u2026 Ohio State RHP Ryan Feltner (4) has been up to 98 mph this spring but works more 91-94 mph with sink and 55 a changeup. He probably fits in relief\u2026 UCLA RHP Jake Bird (5) has solid-average stuff and some moxie\u2026 Loyola Marymount RF Niko Decolati (6) has been an inconsistent performer and has no clear position, but he has sizable strength-driven power for an infielder\u2026 Fullerton RHP Andrew Quezada is a smallish righty who works in the low 90s with a back-end or swing-guy profile\u2026 Washington C Willie MacIver (9) broke his hamate this spring and didn\u2019t catch, but he hit on the Cape and has a chance to catch once he\u2019s physically able to do it again\u2026 Oklahoma LF Cade Harris (10) was in a loaded OU outfield with Kyler Murray and Steele Walker but has more average tools across the board, a reserve type\u2026 North Carolina 3B Kyle Datres (12) showed some big-league potential in flashes at UNC with average-type tools but nothing loud.\nLos Angeles Dodgers\nLink to Draft Selections\nMississippi prep RHP J.T. Ginn (1) has arguably the best two-pitch combo in the draft with his fastball/curveball, but he\u2019s maxed-out physically and is likely a reliever\u2026 West Virginia RHP Michael Grove (2) missed the year rehabbing TJ but was electric and lightly scouted last spring. There\u2019s shades of Mitchell White here\u2026 Hofstra LHP John Rooney (3) is a tall, pitchability lefty with average stuff and advanced command\u2026 Texas prep RHP Braydon Fisher (4) is very young for the class and runs his heater into the mid-90s along with a slider that flashes 55\u2026 Louisville 2B Devin Mann (5) is just okay defensively but has average hit/power/run tools that are useful anywhere\u2026 Florida 2B Deacon Liput (10) had an up-and-down career with the Gators but can stick in the dirt, has average raw power, and has hit at times\u2026 Junior college RHP Trey Dillard (16) has been up to 99 mph with an average slider, but command/consistency issues\u2026 Morehead State RF Niko Hulsizer (18) broke his hamate bone this year but has been productive and has big raw power.\nMiami Marlins\nLink to Draft Selections\nFlorida prep CF Connor Scott (1) is a 6-foot-4 athlete who\u2019s a 70 runner and has a smooth lefty cut but was hurt a lot this spring\u2026 NorCal prep CF Osiris Johnson (2) is super young for the class and has top-of-the-scale bat speed and athletic actions but didn\u2019t perform last summer when he faced good pitching\u2026 Georgia prep C Will Banfield (2) has a chance to be a plus receiver with a plus arm and 55 raw power, but his swing has changed more times than most scouts can count\u2026 Kentucky LF Tristan Pompey (3) has plus raw power and some speed but poor defensive instincts, so that bat will need to play\u2026 Ole Miss C Nick Fortes (4) has a 45 arm but is a good receiver with a very patient approach and some offensive ability to fit as a modern catcher\u2026 Texas A&M RHP Cason Sherrod (7) is a senior who sits 92-95 with a 55 slider but had a down spring\u2026 Arkansas State RHP Peyton Culbertson (8) is a smaller relief type who\u2019s been into the high 90s this spring\u2026 Purdue righty Tanner Andrews (10) is a senior sign who\u2019s been up to 96 mph this spring and fits best in relief\nMilwaukee Brewers\nLink to Draft Selections\nSoCal prep SS Brice Turang (1) was the top prep bat in the class a year ago but had just an okay spring that dimmed him in the view of many\u2026 Mississippi prep RF Joe Gray (2) has given scouts good and bad looks at dozens of events over the years but finished with a strong spring. At worst, he\u2019s a classic right-field prototype with a volatile bat, but he has a better chance to stay in center than most prospects in that bucket\u2026 Hawaii prep CF Micah Bello (2) grew into a potential everyday center fielder this spring with physical development\u2026 Junior college LHP Aaron Ashby (4) is the nephew of Andy Ashby and has a plus curveball, low 90s heater, and gaudy numbers\u2026 Oregon State RHP Drew Rasmussen (6) is a senior sign who\u2019s rehabbing his second TJ but is up to 97 mph with back-of-the-bullpen stuff at his best\u2026 Auburn righty Davis Daniel(11) didn\u2019t have the durability to start this spring, then remade himself into a mid-90s reliever down the stretch\u2026 Florida prep RF Elijah Cabell (14) has 65 raw power and arm strength in a Clint Frazier-type swing, but he struck out nearly 30% of the time this spring as a nearly 19-year-old high schooler\u2026 Junior college RHP Nick Iverson (15) works in the low-90s and hits 95 mph when he\u2019s on, with solid-average stuff and a back-end-starter profile.\nNew York Mets\nLink to Draft Selections\nWisconsin CF Jarred Kelenic (1) is arguably the best prep hitter in the class and should stick in center while exhibiting about average power\u2026Texas prep RHP Simeon Woods-Richardson (2) is an athlete with a very loose arm who flashes three above-average pitches but is still pretty raw\u2026 South Carolina LF Carlos Cortes (3) has plus lefty raw power and ended the season hot after a terrible start. He\u2019s squatty, has played some second base ,and is ambidextrous\u2026 South Carolina RHP Adam Hill (4) looked like a second-rounder some days and a seventh-rounder on others. His fastball/slider/command trifecta could produce a fourth starter or middle reliever\u2026 Clemson RHP Ryley Gilliam (5) reminds some of Trevor Gott, a smaller reliever who gets into the mid-90s with a sharp curve and is always in attack mode\u2026 Tylor Megill (8) is a big righty from Arizona with a low-90s fastball and average slide\u2026 Cal Poly C Nick Meyer (6) is an above-average defender and thrower who has a little contact ability but no power\u2026 Missouri RHP Bryce Montes de Oca (9) has had injuries, but is a 6-foot-7 behemoth who\u2019s hit 100 mph. The Mets drafted a bunch of big college arms on Day 2.\nPhiladelphia Phillies\nLink to Draft Selections\nWichita State 3B Alec Bohm (1) has 70 raw power and looks like Kris Bryant if you squint, but he needs to make some swing adjustments and improve defensively\u2026 Fullerton RHP Colton Eastman (4) sits 90-92 with an above-average changeup and improving curve that\u2019s above average at times. He threw more strikes this year\u2026 Notre Dame RF Matt Vierling (5) has above-average raw power, arm strength, and athleticism but likely fits on a corner\u2026 Georgia prep SS Kendall Simmons (6) had a rough spring at the plate but looked like a young Addison Russell at times last summer. He\u2019s twitchy and explosive and looks great taking BP but is erratic in games\u2026 Seth Lancaster (8) is a rowdy senior-sign shortstop with low-ball power and a terrible mustache. NorCal prep RHP Dominic Pipkin (9) had a down spring, as well. At his best, he peaks at 96 mph with a super loose arm and starter traits\u2026 SS Matt Kroon (18) bounced all over the place as an amateur but stuck the landing as a junior at Oklahoma State and had great numbers. He has a utility infield profile, enough arm for the left side, and experience at several infield spots.\nPittsburgh Pirates\nLink to Draft Selections\nSouth Alabama CF Travis Swaggerty (1) has plus tools galore and hit last summer with wood for Team USA, then had an uneven spring adjusting to a new power-focused swing\u2026 Florida prep RHP Gunnar Hoglund (CBA) and second-rounder Texas prep RHP Braxton Ashcraft are both classic projection arms with clean deliveries and three pitches around average now, with Hoglund possessing a little more present stuff\u2026 Vanderbilt SS Connor Kaiser (3) is in the mold of Jordy Mercer as a big shortstop with a solid glove, some power, and inconsistent contact/rhythm\u2026 Arkansas C Grant Koch (5) improved as a defender this year, but his offense backed up a bit after having been regarded as a power-over-hit offensive catcher last season\u2026 Arizona RHP Michael Flynn (6) has been up to 95 mph this spring but his offspeed and command are more fringe to average, profiling as a back-end starter or middle reliever\u2026 North Carolina State LF Brett Kinneman (7) is limited to left and has some swing-and-miss concerns, but he tapped into his 55 raw power a lot this year\u2026 UConn C Zach Susi (12) has a line-drive swing and limited offensive upside but can stick behind the plate\u2026 Duke SS Zack Kone (13) is another big shortstop with some power and contact questions like Kaiser\u2026 Cal LF Jonah Davis (15) is a fringey defender with swing-and-miss concerns but has plus raw power that he gets to in games.\nSan Diego Padres\nLink to Draft Selections\nTennessee prep LHP Ryan Weathers (1) is the son of David Weathers. All three pitches and his command are above average despite a very short stride and maxed-out frame\u2026 Florida prep 2B Xavier Edwards (CBA) is an 80 runner who fits somewhere up the middle and has a long track record of hitting from both sides of the plate\u2026 Texas Tech 2B Grant Little (CBB) doesn\u2019t have a clear position and doesn\u2019t have loud tools but is average across the board with monster numbers\u2026 Missouri State RHP Dylan Coleman (4) is 6-foot-6 and has been up to 97 mph while showing a 55 slider, but he may ultimately end up in the pen\u2026 East Carolina RF Dwanya Williams-Sutton (5) is a solid athlete with big raw power and huge exit velos but just okay numbers\u2026 Rutgers CF Jawuan Harris (7) has above-average to plus tools across the board but 30 pitch recognition and limited reps due to football and a pot suspension\u2026 Texas Tech RHP Jose Quezada (10) is a senior sign who works 91-95 with a slider that\u2019s a 55 at times\u2026 Pennsylvania prep 2B Sean Guilbe (12) will stick in the dirt and has above-average power along with some feel to hit\u2026 Georgia 1B Michael Curry (16) has plus raw power and some hitability that gives him a chance to profile after moving full-time from catcher.\nSan Francisco Giants\nLink to Draft Selections\nGeorgia Tech C Joey Bart (1) has plus raw power and arm strength, along with elite makeup and surprising defensive ability for a catcher of his size. Contact is the only question\u2026 Kentucky RHP Sean Hjelle (2) is 6-foot-11 and throws a low-90s sinker with a one-of-a-kind plane and average offspeed stuff. He fits as a No. 4 starter\u2026 Grand Canyon RHP Jake Wong (3) attacks with sinking 94-96 but has fringe to average offspeed stuff. He could work as a back-end starter or seventh-/eighth-inning guy\u2026 Junior college RHP Blake Rivera (4) was up to 97 mph this spring with an above-average slider and is likely a long-term fit in the bullpen\u2026 UCF LHP Bryce Tucker (14) works in the low 90s with a solid-average slider and possibly the most intense mound presence in the draft\u2026 Ole Miss CF Ryan Olenek (17) is an under-the-radar favorite of ours: a lanky 6-foot-4 plus runner with plus bat control and sneaky power who rarely struck out this year.

    "https://www.masslive.com/news/2018/06/pope_francis_accepts_resignati.html": "VATICAN - Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Chilean Bishop Juan Barros Madrid from his post in the diocese of Osorno.\nThe acceptance is part of the Church's ongoing narrative in how it has handled its global clergy sex abuse crisis that in this case brought a popular pontiff face-to-face with involved bishops, protesters, victims as well as destroyed documents on his home continent.\nFrancis had named the 61-year-old Barros bishop of Osorno in 2015 and defended the appointment despite widespread protests that followed in Chile. Barros had long been accused of witnessing and covering up the sexual abuse of minors by a priest who had once mentored him.\nAll of Chile's 34 Roman Catholic bishops resigned last month following a meeting in Rome during which Francis said the bishops were all collectively responsible for covering up clerical sexual abuse in their dioceses.\nA Vatican investigation earlier this year was said to show that documents related to such crimes were destroyed and actions not taken to protect vulnerable children.\nFrancis, who twice previously had not accepted Barros' offered resignation, then acknowledged that he made \"serious mistakes\" in judging the case due to \"a lack of truthful and balanced information.\"\nHe has also met with survivors, including Juan Carlos Cruz who reportedly tweeted that \"Today begins a new day for the Catholic Church in Chile and hopefully the world. We hope this is the beginning of the end of this culture of abuse and cover up in the Church. Emotional but great day.\"\nJuan Carlos Claret, spokesman for a group of lay Catholics in Osorno who fought for Barros' removal from office, said it was a \"minimum condition\" that they had sought from the pope.\n\"The resignation of these bishops should not dilute their criminal responsibility,\" he told the news agency Reuters.\n\"They shouldn't leave their posts to go home; some of them should go to prison. The pope has statements in his possession (from his investigators) that contain allegations of crimes we don't even know about.\"\nBarros has denied the allegations that he covered up the actions of Fernando Karadima, once one of Chile's most popular priests who prepared boys for the priesthood.\nKaradima was found guilty in 2011 by the Vatican of sexually abusing several minors during the 1980s and 1990s. The priest who has maintained his innocence was sentenced to a life of prayer and solitude.\nThe June 11 communique from the Vatican said that Bishop Jorge Enrique Conchua Cayuqueo, a Franciscan and auxiliary bishop of Santiago, will now also serve as apostolic administrator for the Osorno diocese.\nIn addition to Barros, the communique said Francis accepted the resignation of Archbishop Cristian Caro Cordero of Puerto Montt, naming Fr. Ricardo Basilio Morales Galindo, provincial for the Order of Mercy in Chile as apostolic administrator.\nHe also accepted the resignation of Bishop Gonzalo Duarte Garcia de Cortazar of Valparaiso, naming Bishop Pedro Mario Ossandon Buljevic, auxiliary bishop of Santiago, as apostolic administrator.\nBoth men are 75, the age when such resignations are required to be submitted to the pope.",

These are the dispensaries where owners got their initial applications in by Feb. 15, got approval from the communities where they are operating and submitted the second step of the application process by June 15.\nAnother 98 dispensaries that submitted initial applications by Feb. 15, but didn\u2019t submit the second step of the application in a timely manner or at all, will get cease and desist orders next week and must shut down. If they continue operating, the owners risk not being able to get a license at all.\nA list of the 98 dispensaries will be released by the state later this month. In March, the state sent cease and desist letters to more than 200 dispensaries that were operating, but didn't submit applications for licenses, ordering them to shut down.\nMore:Board sets final language for proposal to legalize recreational pot\nMore:Why these marijuana edibles are prohibited by Michigan regulators\nAnd yet another emergency rule will require marijuana business owners who have been approved for a license to pay the $48,000 regulatory assessment within 10 days or be forced to shut down until they come up with the money. Currently, 37 marijuana business owners have been approved for licenses, but only 10 have paid their regulatory assessments and are up and running. Of those, 16 were approved last month and 21 were approved on Monday.\nThe move is meant to separate out the dispensaries who are serious about getting a license and those who just want to operate with little state oversight.\nThe rules come as the state is trying to transition from the medical marijuana market devised after voters legalized weed for medical use in 2008 to an industry that is regulated and taxed by the state. The old market was made up of caregivers who could grow up to 12 plants for each of five patients as well as themselves. There was little, if any, state oversight of the caregiver-model of medical marijuana.\nThe new regulated market is much more expensive for business owners and creates five classes of licenses for growers, processors, testing facilities, transporters and dispensaries. Once licensed, the owners have to come up with the regulatory assessment, pay city fees, get their products tested under a more stringent set of state guidelines, and pay a 3 percent tax on the gross receipts of the dispensary as well as the 6 percent sales tax.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to move the process along,\u201d said Andrew Brisbo, executive director of the Bureau of Medical Marijuana Regulation.\nThe new Dec. 15 deadline is the third time the department has extended the deadline for dispensaries to get a license or shut down. While Brisbo was adamant last month that a Sept. 15 deadline wasn\u2019t going to be pushed again, the department relented after hearing from a group of lawmakers, officials in Ann Arbor and Lansing, and several organizations that were worried about losing access to medical marijuana if many of the dispensaries around the state had to close.\n\u201cThis extension focuses on ensuring access,\u201d Brisbo said.\nThe state has received 702 license applications since Dec. 15, including 401 applicants who have submitted full applications, and the review and licensing process has been slow and tedious. Preliminary approval has been given to 72 applicants, while 53 have been denied. And 37 full licenses have been awarded while eight have been denied. The state\u2019s regulatory assessment, which covers the cost to administer and enforce the medical marijuana market, will increase from $48,000 to $66,000 on Oct. 1. Those costs are spread over the state departments of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs, Attorney General, Michigan State Police, Treasury and Health and Human Services.\nMichigan voters approved legalizing medical marijuana in 2008 and will consider legalizing weed for recreational use on Nov. 6. If it gets approved by voters, the licensing of recreational marijuana businesses will be the responsibility of LARA, not the politically-appointed board that hands out licenses for medical marijuana businesses.\nKathleen Gray covers the marijuana industry for the Detroit Free Press.

Here came T.J. Oshie with his wife and two young daughters, kneeling for photos with it. Jay Beagle\u2019s family stepped in next, his toddler son too short to see inside the Cup\u2019s bowl but desperately curious to look inside.\nAfter 13 years, Ovechkin gazed like a proud father at the team he led to a championship that found so many painful ways to elude him over his career. After a few minutes, a group of friends implored Ovechkin to join them. He dove in headlong, let out a yell and celebrated the first title in the 43-year history of the Washington Capitals.\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain how I feel,\u201d Ovechkin said on the ice after the game. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\nThe Capitals erased a third-period deficit in a furious three-minute stretch of the third period to win 4-3 over the expansion Vegas Golden Knights in Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Final at T-Mobile Arena. Lars Eller netted the game-winning goal with just less than eight minutes remaining to give Washington its fourth consecutive win.\nOvechkin scored a power-play goal to give Washington a brief lead in the second period. Nicklas Backstrom, his longtime running mate in Washington, flipped a saucer pass across the ice that Ovechkin buried for his franchise-record 15th goal of the playoffs.\nHe high-stepped directly to the boards after scoring, pumping his arms and showing the fire that marked his stellar postseason.\n\u201cOvi had a different step tonight,\u201d Oshie said. \u201cYou saw that a lot in these playoffs. You watch his shifts, you watch what he did tonight \u2014 he changed the momentum of the game at some points. That\u2019s your leader. That\u2019s what you want him to do.\u201d\nWith or without a Stanley Cup, Ovechkin\u2019s spot in the Hall of Fame would likely have been secured.\nNow, the Russian winger joins the greats of the game with his name etched in silver. A marvelous career with 607 goals receives the ultimate validation after many years of his Capitals teams flaming out under heavier expectations than they carried in 2018.\n\u201cWe did this together, but Alex has been through a lot,\u201d Capitals defenseman Matt Niskanen said. \u201cHe\u2019s taken some heat in the past so man, that feels good to see him go out there and reach the pinnacle. Really happy for him. He was a stud this spring. He led the charge, he produced \u2014 played hard, blocked shots, ran people over. He did it all for us.\u201d\nFor that effort, Ovechkin also earned the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player throughout the playoffs.\n\"It's just like a dream,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cIt was a hard, long season. We fight through it. We worked so hard through all the years and we were together.\u201d\nOvechkin received more help from his team than in past seasons. Braden Holtby\u2019s diving stick save in Game 2 bailed out Washington on the cusp of falling behind two games to Vegas. The return of Evgeny Kuznetsov in Game 3 sparked the Washington offense as it had through the first three rounds. Kuznetsov led all scorers in the playoffs with 32 points, including an assist on Washington\u2019s first goal of the night.\nWashington\u2019s second line harassed Vegas throughout the series, and Oshie and Backstrom were exceptional. They teamed up for 44 points during the Stanley Cup Playoffs and created chance after chance in the finals.\nWithout their captain, though, the Capitals are not lifting the Cup.\n\u201cHe was very comfortable and he was very confident, I think,\u201d Backstrom said of Ovechkin. \u201cHe was really calm. Everything was really good. It\u2019s impressive the way he scores (goals) and the way he worked out there. He was just a machine there in the playoffs.\u201d\nWhen he arrived in 2004 as the first overall pick in the draft, Ovechkin felt like the cornerstone to a Capitals revival. The team reached the final in 1998 but did not win a game against the Detroit Red Wings.\nOvechkin understood and embraced the expectations from the start \u2014 they came straight from the top, from owner Ted Leonsis.\n\u201cFunny story, I was at [Ted's] house and we kind of met up with his family,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cWe were swimming in the pool and he told me one day we're going to win it. It was the first year. I didn\u2019t even know the team.\n\u201cI knew he wants it so bad and this organization wants it so bad. It's nice to be part of it. it's nice to be in this organization all 13 years or 14, whatever. It was a tough time, but we fight through it and we get results. I'm going home to our families, our fans and it's just something special, you know.\"",

When there\u2019s a big game, he\u2019s going to play. Of course, he\u2019s only human, and occasionally he will need a rest. A home game against Cardiff seemed the ideal opportunity. Enter Moreno.\nOf course, Moreno seemed to get beaten very easily by two Cardiff players on their way to scoring the Welsh side\u2019s only goal of the game. The knives were out for a player who frequently frustrates the Anfield faithful.\nNot in the eyes of Sadio Mane, though, who blames himself.\n\u201cA team like this are never easy to play\u201d, the Liverpool Echo report Mane as saying. \u201cSometimes you have to be patient, try not to lose the ball. At the end we scored four goals and deserved to win\n\u201cI think we conceded because we lacked communication. Normally I am with Alberto [Moreno] on the left but I was in midfield and [one on one] it is not easy for Moreno.\n\u201cThat is part of football, we will try to learn from that.\u201d\nHumility aside, Mane does raise a significant point in assigning blame for conceding goals. Defending is a collective exercise, much more than attacking, and a mistake by a defender is usually the result of a mistake by someone higher up the pitch. Leicester City\u2019s distinctly average centre backs looked superhuman with N\u2019Golo Kante in front of them, and have since returned to looking mediocre. Dejan Lovren struggled horribly before he was playing in a better structured pressing system with Virgil van Dijk alongside him. When Mane says he was out of position, he was correct. While Moreno did do poorly on the goal, in another reality he would have never been called into action.\nExcellent understanding of collective responsibility, Sadio.",

European football\u2019s governing body has been collecting information on this matter for several months, and it is believed a verdict could be reached this week.\nThe information gathered includes a series of articles published by Der Spiegel in November 2018.

Moreover, they competed in the 2014/15 Champions League with a reduced squad.\nFIFA, the EPL and the English Football Association are conducting their own investigations into this matter.\nAs expected, the Sky Blues have adamantly denied breaching regulations surrounding FFP.

Tony Stark\u2019s plane is ambushed by unknown forces. With the help of his digital assistant, FRIDAY, he leaps from the crippled vessel, dons the Iron Man suit, and goes into action. Players can clearly be seen using their hands to attack enemies with the Iron Man suit\u2019s iconic hand blasters.

    "https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/4/17935982/new-nintendo-switch-hardware-2019": "The Wall Street Journal is reporting that a new version of the popular Nintendo Switch hardware will be arriving next year, \u201caccording to suppliers and others with direct knowledge of the plan.\u201d\nThere are few other details about what the new hardware revision would improve over the current model.\n\u201cThe current Switch uses a lower-end liquid-crystal display without some technologies that are standard in more recent smartphone LCDs,\u201d The Wall Street Journal reported. \u201cUpdating the display with these technologies would make it brighter, thinner and more energy-efficient. The updated Switch isn\u2019t expected to adopt the organic light-emitting diode or OLED panels used in Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhone X series.\u201d\nRelated Nintendo Switch review\nNintendo has already sold almost 20 million units of the hardware worldwide between its launch in 2017 and June 30 of this year, and an updated version of the system could help maintain that high level of player enthusiasm. The new hardware is reported to be on the way for the second half of 2019, giving the current version of the system another big holiday season in its current configuration.\nNintendo executives have stated in the past that not only does the company want every family to own a Nintendo Switch, it would like for every member of the family to have their own system.\n\u201cThe biggest attraction of Nintendo Switch is that the console can be carried around and used easily for competitive gameplay via local wireless connection,\u201d Nintendo creative fellow Shigeru Miyamoto stated during a financial briefing earlier this year. \u201cIf consumers come to take it for granted that everybody has a Nintendo Switch, then we can create new and very Nintendo genres of play, and Nintendo Switch can have a life apart from smart devices and other video game systems.

    "https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch/2018/10/4/17936984/new-nintendo-switch-hardware-what-we-want-to-see": "The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Nintendo will release a new version of the Nintendo Switch console in the second half of 2019, but there are few details about what might be improved outside of vague wording about an upgraded screen.\nBut what would make the Switch better?\nThe screen/power problem\nNintendo Switch comes with a weird design issue where it has to work as a portable and as a console, and resolution shifts depending on where you\u2019re playing and how much power the system is drawing. So you can say you want a larger screen, or a screen with a higher resolution, but doing so means you\u2019ll need to increase the overall power of the system while also dealing with battery life when the console is in portable mode.\nAnd the screen\u2019s resolution doesn\u2019t really matter when you\u2019re playing it attached to a television where it can draw wall current. I also doubt Nintendo is going to create a system that isn\u2019t 100 percent backward compatible with the previous version of the Switch; we\u2019re not going to see a system revamp that has games the older systems can\u2019t play. So we\u2019re not going to see a huge jump in any of these areas. A nice speed bump that would make it easier for developers to release games that don\u2019t struggle with the framerate would of course be awesome, but I\u2019m not holding my breath.\nMight we see a screen that\u2019s brighter and clearer, that looks more like a modern smart phone screen? Absolutely. But a jump in resolution or size is less likely.\nSo what\u2019s left?\nMy realistic wishlist for a new Switch includes a lot of small quality of life improvements. A slightly larger battery would be worth the weight, and Joy-Cons that are better suited for larger hands or longer sessions would be amazing. There are so many of us whose hands cramp when they play a demanding game in portable mode for more than a few minutes.\nMore internal storage so the mini SD card doesn\u2019t feel like such a mandatory immediate purchase with the system would also be great, and storage is cheap these games. The 32 GB that comes standard with Nintendo Switch now is just paltry when you look at the size of many games.\nOne of Nintendo\u2019s most valuable assets is the data it has collected about how people are playing their Switches, and that will likely lead to improvements in some of the most standard use cases. The kickstand, for instance, gets much more use than I would have expected and just isn\u2019t up to the task. Making something a bit beefier that could support the Switch while it\u2019s being played on the road seems like it would be a simple, but welcome, addition to the hardware.\nA boost to the system\u2019s Wi-Fi range would also be a major improvement over the existing system.\nThis is probably my own niche tastes coming through, but a built-in way to play the system in tate mode for vertically oriented games would be incredible. There are third-party add-ons that help with this issue, and games that support the feature, but so far there\u2019s no easy way to get everything aligned so it\u2019s easy to use. Imagine a kickstand that can hold the system in other landscape or portrait mode when you set it down. Check out the Flip Grip gallery below to see how Nintendo might tackle this issue.\nGrid View Fangamer\nFangamer\nFangamer\nFangamer\nFangamer\nFangamer\nSo is that all?\nProbably! Getting a hardware refresh two years after launch doesn\u2019t seem that strange these days, but Nintendo won\u2019t want to mess with a good thing and fragment the market. So expect a slightly better screen, maybe some more storage and a few other basic quality of life changes that will make the new Switch better, without making it feel like all-new hardware.\nBut who knows? Nintendo never does the expected thing \u2014 it\u2019s not like any of us saw Labo coming before it was announced \u2014 which means the reported new hardware might veer off into some new direction. But I bet Nintendo is going to play it safe and release a system that\u2019s better than the original, but not radically so.\nAlso, if they could make the Joy-Cons a little quieter when they rumble? That would be fine.",

You\u2019ll find General Naomori Kawarada just past the Ashina Outskirts > Outskirts Wall \u2013 Gate Path Sculptor\u2019s Idol. It\u2019s a tough fight when you\u2019re less than an hour into the game, but it\u2019ll teach you several tactics that you\u2019ll be using throughout the rest of Wolf\u2019s journey.\nApproaching General Naomori Kawarada\nFrom the Outskirts Wall Sculptor\u2019s Idol, grapple to the roof of the gatehouse. If you haven\u2019t yet, make sure you grab the Shuriken Wheel from inside the hallway. Cross the roof heading to the left (away from the Sculptor\u2019s Idol) to the clearing on the far side. Pick up the Pellets, then head along the left side of the arena \u2014 you\u2019ll see General Naomori Kawarada below you.\nKeep moving forward to the gate at the far end of the arena. To avoid getting spotted, stick close the the rock wall and don\u2019t stop moving.\nUse the gatehouse to cut to the right. You\u2019ll end up standing above and behind the general. Lock on to him, then jump off the roof toward him. Hit R1/RB when you see the red glow to execute a Stealth Deathblow. This will cut his health in half before the fight even starts.\nGeneral Naomori Kawarada boss fight\nYou\u2019ve been introduced to the fundamentals of Sekiro, and this fight will cement them in your mind. This is where you\u2019ll put blocking, attacking, and even some new moves into practice, all in the same fight.\nAfter you land your first Deathblow, back away a little and start blocking. Don\u2019t worry too much about Deflects in this fight \u2014 it\u2019s not worth opening yourself up to the chance of missing a block.\nThis fight \u2014 like most fights you\u2019ll have in Sekiro \u2014 starts with your enemy rushing toward you with an attack. What you\u2019re waiting for is his Perilous Attack \u2014 an unblockable, horizontal sweeping swing of his sword. He\u2019ll take a distinctive stance when he\u2019s about to do this and a bright red kanji will appear over Wolf.\nAs soon as you see the symbol, jump and then jump again. This move is called a Jump Kick. It gets you out of the way of the unblockable attack and \u2014 just as importantly \u2014 it deals substantial Posture Damage to the general.\nAfter his sweeping attack, block any other attacks he throws at you. Keep blocking his regular attacks and Jump Kick whenever he sweeps. Again, don\u2019t worry so much about Deflects. The penalty for missing is enormous, and it\u2019s so early in the game that you won\u2019t be great at them. It\u2019s just as easy to beat him without using tons of Deflects.\nHis other Perilous Attack is a grab. You cannot block grabs. If you see him reach back with his left (non-sword) hand and the red kanji appears, dodge or jump away. If you can, follow your dodge with a Dodge Counterattack by hitting the attack button right after (we didn\u2019t pull this off above).\nJust keep blocking, dodging, Jump Kicking, and sneaking in a hit whenever you can. Don\u2019t rush the fight or press the attack if you\u2019re not comfortable. Your goal isn\u2019t necessarily to deal Vitality damage (his health at the top left of the screen). If you can fill his Posture damage bar (the yellow one at the top center of the screen), you\u2019ll get a Deathblow no matter where his Vitality is.\nWhen you fill his Posture Damage about halfway, he\u2019ll back away and strike a pose with a gray mist around him. This completely resets his Posture Damage. If you can rush in close and land a hit or toss a shuriken, you can interrupt him. If you can\u2019t, don\u2019t worry about it and just keep up with the same tactics.\nLand hits whenever you can \u2014 even if he blocks them, you\u2019ll still deal Posture damage. Watch for his Perilous Attacks and Jump Kick to deal even more Posture damage. With some patience, you\u2019ll break his Posture and land your second Deathblow.\nGeneral Naomori Kawarada rewards\nAfter defeating General Naomori Kawarada, you\u2019ll get a Prayer Bead and a Gourd Seed.\nTake the Gourd Seed to Emma at the Dilapidated Temple to increase the number of times you can use your Healing Gourd. (While you\u2019re there, make sure you install the Shuriken Wheel in your Shinobi Prosthetic, if you haven\u2019t already.)\nYou\u2019ll need to collect three more Prayer Beads before you can cash those in at a Sculptor\u2019s Idol to increase your Vitality and Posture.",

Specifically, Ant-Man plunging into Thanos\u2019 butthole and expanding his size in order to defeat the villain ... from the inside.\nThat\u2019s basically the extent of the \u201cThanus\u201d theory, which is a less a theory than the internet\u2019s new favorite Avengers meme. Even though it probably ... OK, most likely ... OK, most definitely won\u2019t happen in the actual film, a live-action version of what only existed in Photoshops and one-liners has now emerged on the internet for all of our viewing pleasure.\nThough the Ant-Man-jumps-up-Thanos\u2019-butt ending has reached new levels of buzz over the past few weeks, the theory first popped up before Infinity War even came out. According to KnowYourMeme, the joke started on Reddit, as loads of off-beat, shitpost tier theories oft do.\nOn a post suggesting various ways to defeat Thanos, users speculated about Ant-Man shrinking down in size, crawling up Thanos\u2019 various orifices (Thorfices) and expanding (from mouth to urethra specifically, or just entering inside of Thanos someplace else) until the purple villain exploded. It was a post about Ant-Man crawling into Thanos\u2019 ear that the realization that Ant-Man would have to crawl into a more intimate part of Thanos\u2019 anatomy sprung forth.\nReddit user Rayhann specified \u201cthe one where you crawl up his ass and deeply violate his being.\u201d\nFor the record, Squirrel Girl didn\u2019t explicitly crawl up Thanos\u2019 ass, but the panel showcasing her victory has Thanos in a particularly compromising position.\nThe concept of Ant-Man crawling up Thanos\u2019 ass was out there, floating around far corners of the internet. But the theory made it to Twitter \u2014 the equivalent of emerging into the mainstream \u2014 just a few days after Infinity War.\nScott Lang\u2019s jarring absence from the movie prompted Twitter user @filmgloss to theorize just why Ant-Man didn\u2019t make it into the movie.\nmarvel saw the post about how ant man could defeat thanos by crawling into his ass and instantly growing in size and that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t put him in the movie, send tweet \u2014 c a t (@filmgloss) April 30, 2018\nWhile this tweet did quite well, the screenshot of it on Tumblr did even better. Soon, other fandoms took notice and the meme proliferated throughout the internet. The theory culminated last summer when a reporter point-blank asked Paul Rudd about it.\nBut renewed hype in the weeks before Avengers: Endgame have stirred up this theory turned meme. Subreddit r/dankmemes began to share memes about Ant-Man crawling up Thanos\u2019s butt, some with fake screenshots of the Russo Brothers weighing in. Like Powerful Shaggy before it, the meme exploded when it went off Reddit and Tumblr and to Twitter, bringing awareness and merit to this quite shitpost-y shitpost. A Brazilian petition dedicated to making this moment happen in Avengers: Endgame has amassed over 35,000 signatures at the time of writing.\nWith all the footage done, however, it isn\u2019t super likely that the Russo brothers incorporate this outlandish theory, even in a post-credits scene.\nCorrection (April 1): A previous version of this story credited the wrong creator of the video. YouTube user HELLO THERE created the Thanos video. We\u2019ve edited the article to reflect this.\nThat\u2019s alright, though, as heroic internet denizen HELLO THERE created an incredibly accurate rendering of Ant-Man diving right into Thanos\u2019 butt and expanding.

However, there\u2019s one GoT leak out there that could actually reveal what happens in the show\u2019s final episode before it even airs.\nWarning: HUGE Game of Thrones finale spoilers below.\nThis leak comes to us from redditor u/afraidpart, who shared several posts full of Game of Thrones spoilers roughly nine months ago. At the time, they were ignored, but midway through Season 8, those claims started to come true.\nSubscribe for free to Multiverse and get Game of Thrones coverage delivered to your inbox the night the episode airs.\nHere\u2019s a list of Game of Thrones Season 8 leaks from u/afraidpart that already happened:\nThe Mountain kills Missandei.\nThe Night King dies in Episode 3.\nThe Hound and the Mountain both die in Cleganebowl.\nJaime and Cersei Lannister die together in a somewhat unsatisfying way.\nSo what\u2019s next? Redditor u/afraidpart\u2019s intel on Game of Thrones Season 8, Episode 6 was a little bit less clear, but we do have a few juicy details.\nAlso read: Who lived and who died in Game of Thrones Season 8, Episode 5.\nHere\u2019s my personal favorite:\n\u201cThe Iron Throne gets melted by the dragon.\u201d\nActually, it\u2019s possible that already happened. Daenerys and Drogon basically leveled King\u2019s Landing in Episode 5, and that may have included the Iron Throne. We never got a look into the throne room during last night\u2019s episode. Could the Game of Thrones finale open on an image of the throne melted or destroyed? We wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that\u2019s exactly what happens.\nOn a similar note, the Season 8 leak claims that \u201cJon Snow finally sees Arya after they get to the throne.\u201d We\u2019re guessing this means Jon will see his sister using her Faceless Man training, possibly right after she assassinates someone else (Dany?).\nAs for Tyrion, it looks like he\u2019ll do exactly what we expect and turn on Daenerys in the Game of Thrones finale:\nWhen Daenerys is making her speech everyone is mad at her. Tyrion makes some comment (he doesn\u2019t get sound) and throws his pin (?) on the ground and she sends him to the prison? Idk what was going on here.\nFinally, when it comes to Jon and Dany, it\u2019s unclear exactly how Game of Thrones Season 8 will end. Based on this leak, it seems HBO might have actually filmed multiple different versions of the finale. However, we do get one pretty awesome description of how Daenerys could die:\nDanaerys actually DOES die, she\u2019s killed (stabbed I think) by Jon Snow. She goes back to the throne room and touches the throne. Has no idea WHY he kills her, there\u2019s a missing chunk. But it happens in the throne room. I asked him why and he said he doesn\u2019t know and I don\u2019t even think they saw the actual death scene, just the fact that she\u2019s dead. So he\u2019s only assuming she gets murdered, otherwise she commits suicide but that doesn\u2019t make much sense. Then the dragon flies away with her body but doesn\u2019t kill Snow. Either way, she dies.\nThat\u2019s a lot to pack into a single episode of television, but with an 80-minute runtime, it\u2019s possible that Game of Thrones Season 8, Episode 6 will be able to get the job done.\nThe Game of Thrones finale airs Sunday, May 19 at 9 p.m. Eastern on HBO.",

That screen always holds some kind of clue, be it map coordinates or a specific landmark. Once a player discovers a certain location, they can find a Battle Star in a fashion similar to the \u201csearch between a\u201d Weekly Challenge format.\nHere\u2019s Omen, a Legendary skin that might be available later this week when Week 7 starts, which means you\u2019ll have to complete all of the Week 7 Challenges if you want any chance at getting this skin:\nOmen looks similar to Raven but if he were a crisply-costumed supervillain instead. Epic Games\nSo what does it all mean?\nSeason 4 brought with it a series of meteors and a superhero theme to Fortnite, but what\u2019s \u201creal\u201d and what\u2019s \u201cfake\u201d?\nBased on all of the cameras and film sets, it seems like some production company was filming a movie when real meteors crashed into the map. Consider this loading screen, which depicts an active production as a meteor strikes:\nThis 'Fortnite' loading screen helps fill in some backstory. Epic Games\nBecause Hop Rocks exist and cause gravity distortions, it seems perfectly plausible that the many superheroes and supervillains that also pop up in various loading screens are totally real. Keep in mind that there\u2019s also the superhero mansion and supervillain lair in the map now as well. And yet, there are also loading screens depicting superheroes and villains hanging out on a film set, so who knows?\nIt\u2019s impossible to know for sure, but it seems likely that the Visitor and Omen skins might be available as part of the Blockbuster Challenge when Week 7 starts on Thursday at 4 a.m. Eastern.",

Royals have had a sequence of poor results in recent times, losing three of their last four games and six of eight overall so far.\nSmith will, however, leave for Australia on May 1 for their World Cup camp, and Royals will still have a league game to go, on May 4 against Delhi Capitals in Delhi.\nESPNcricinfo understands the Royals team management and owners decided to replace Rahane with Smith, who had been shortlisted as the leader after the 2018 IPL auction, following a sequence of poor results in the ongoing competition.\nRahane will continue to be a key voice in the side, therefore the Royals see this as a small restructuring process to secure the results required to move up the table\n\"Ajinkya Rahane did a fantastic job in leading the team to the playoffs last year, however, the franchise now thinks a fresh approach is needed to bring their 2019 campaign back on track,\" a Royals statement said. \"Steve has always been part of the leadership team within RR and Rahane will continue to be a key voice in the side, therefore the Royals see this as a small restructuring process to secure the results required to move up the table.\"\nSpeaking at the toss ahead of the game against Mumbai Indians in Jaipur on Saturday afternoon, Smith said, \"Ajinkya has done a terrific job over the last year and a half. The owners thought there should be a change in the leadership, and he'll be part of the leadership group as well.\"\nSmith was expected to lead Royals last season, but they were forced to make a change when Smith stepped down as the Royals captain, following the ball-tampering ban imposed on him by Cricket Australia. Rahane was named captain as a result. The ban, which didn't prevent Smith from playing T20 leagues around the world, ended on March 29 this year and he has featured so far in seven of the eight matches Royals have played so far.\nBCCI\nThis will be the second time Smith will take up leadership duties following the ban, having led Comilla Victorians in the Bangladesh Premier League earlier this year. Royals are currently seventh on the points table with just two wins and just six matches left.\nIncidentally, Smith was one of two senior players left out by Royals in their last match, against Kings XI Punjab. The former Australia captain has so far managed just 186 runs in seven innings, at a strike rate of 107.51 this season. Part of this has also been down to him batting largely out of position, at No. 4, instead of one spot higher, where he has made a bulk of his IPL runs for Royals in the past.\nRahane, who is India's Test vice-captain, led Royals in 23 matches between 2018 and 2019, winning nine of them. In contrast, Smith had led Royals to six wins in eight games when he was the interim captain in 2014 and 2015.\nRahane's success as top-order batsmen between 2012 and 2015 had prompted the franchise to promote him to the helm. During his captaincy phase in the last two seasons, as an opener, Rahane scored 455 runs in 16 innings at an average of 30.33 with two half-centuries. Rahane the opener, without the burden of captaincy weighing him down, has better numbers: 1923 runs in 58 innings at an average of 38.46, with 15 50-plus scores including a century.",

The jury found for Pierre and the award was filed on Tuesday with the U.S. District Court in Miami.\nPierre, a 60-year-old mother of six children, is a member of the Soldiers of Christ Church, a Catholic missionary group that helps the poor.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t discriminate when someone has a religious belief,\u201d said Pierre\u2019s Miami-based lawyer, Marc Brumer, citing the federal law. \u201cYou have to accommodate them.\u201d\nBrumer said Hilton argued in court that it never knew Pierre was a missionary, or why she always wanted Sundays off. \u201cThere were letters in file and her pastor went down there,\u201d Brumer said.\nHilton issued a statement about the verdict.\n\u201cWe are very disappointed by the jury\u2019s verdict, and don\u2019t believe that it is supported by the facts of this case or the law,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cWe intend to appeal, and demonstrate that the Conrad Miami was and remains a welcoming place for all guests and employees.\u201d\nBrumer said while there\u2019s a $300,000 cap on punitive damage awards in federal court, he expects Pierre to receive between $300,000 to $500,000.\nThe jury also awarded $35,000 in back wages and $500,000 for emotional pain and mental anguish.\nPierre said she notified her employer from the beginning that she couldn\u2019t work on Sundays due to her religious beliefs, according to the lawsuit. But in 2009, the hotel began scheduling her on Sundays. Pierre told her employer she would have to leave her job. The hotel then accommodated her request until 2015.\nBut then late that year, Pierre\u2019s schedule was changed again to include Sundays, and she sought a letter from her pastor.\nIn 2016, Jean Pierre was fired for alleged misconduct, negligence and \u201cunexcused absences,\u201d according to the lawsuit.",

Cherry called the squad \u201ca scary team.\u201d\n\u201cThey hit the ball and run and keep running until you force them to stop,\u201d Cherry said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing our homework. I think they\u2019re beatable, but it\u2019s going to be a matter of execution of our pitches and being able to put the bat on the ball and put some pressure on them.\u201d\nChristopher Reynolds is the team\u2019s \u201cace,\u201d and one of the pitchers who could start against Michigan.\nHe threw a one-hitter with 11 strikeouts in a complete-game win over Wyoming in a region semifinal and tossed five shutout innings with 10 Ks in the championship game.\n\u201cHis control was precise against Wyoming,\u201d Cherry said. \u201cHe had a little less control \u2013 I think that was based on some nerves \u2013 in the championship game.\n\u201cI talked briefly to the Montana coach after the game and he said \u2018We just couldn\u2019t get anything going against the kid.\u2019 They just couldn\u2019t get the bat on the ball.\u201d\nCherry relies on first base Cooper Smith in the field and at the plate.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a super-steady, a solid glove,\u201d Cherry said \u201cHe\u2019s been our first baseman for three years going now. With his bat, he stays consistently on plane and he\u2019s a see-ball, hit-ball type of hitter. He can drive the ball at times and he can slap the ball the other way to help the team out.\u201d\nAnd if things are close late, Cherry won\u2019t hesitate to bring in A.J.

And that\u2019s on top of traveling to San Bernardino, California last week for the regionals and Boise earlier in the month for the state finals.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t use league general funds to fund the postseason,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be fair to the other 360 of kids and families in the program to pay for the 13 in the tourney.\u201d\nFriends of Coeur d\u2019Alene Little League have set up a Gofundme.com page (CDAAllStarsWorldSeries) to help defray the costs for parents.

About 100 wooden transport cases were sent to the DMZ in recent weeks to prepare for receiving US troop remains.\nBut Thursday\u2019s no-show comes after Kim scuttled a rendezvous with Pompeo during his trip to Pyongyang.\nPompeo last week failed to demonstrate any progress on denuclearization talks, leading one source with knowledge of the discussions to say the White House felt it went \u201cas badly as it could have gone.\u201d\n\u201cThe North Koreans were just messing around, not serious about moving forward,\u201d the source told CNN\u2019s Michelle Kosinski, adding that Pompeo had been promised a meeting with Kim, and the fact that it failed to materialize sent a big message.\nThe Defense Department estimates there are up to 5,300 sets of US service member remains still somewhere in North Korea. A total of 7,697 personnel remain unaccounted for from the Korean War. Some are pilots who were shot down, some are ground troops, others may be those who died in prisoner-of-war camps.\nWhile in Brussels for the annual NATO summit on Thursday, both Trump and Pompeo expressed confidence in the diplomatic process with North Korea despite lacking of tangible signs of progress.\nPompeo said his counterpart Kim Yong Chol in North Korea \u201cmade a commitment\u201d that North Korea intends \u201cto denuclearize.\u201d\nTrump also again touted his meeting with the Kim Jong Un, calling it \u201can amazing meeting\u201d and saying the two \u201cestablished very good relations.\u201d",
