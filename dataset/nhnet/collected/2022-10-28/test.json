            "Read Story Transcript\nAlabama's virtual ban on abortion \u2014 including in cases of rape or incest \u2014 shows no understanding of what victims of sexual assault go through, a survior says.\n\"It's short-sighted, it's idealistic, and their imagination of what we should experience does not reflect our reality,\" Dina Zirlott told The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti.\nZirlott was raped in Alabama when she was 17, and discovered she was pregnant at the eight-month mark. The fetus had a brain condition \"incompatible with life,\" but Zirlott was unable to obtain a late-term abortion because her own life was not directly in danger.\nHer daughter Zoe was born severely disabled, and died one year later after \"constant\" suffering. Zirlott says she would have had an abortion to prevent that suffering.\n\"I would have sacrificed myself if it meant she could have suffered one less day.\"\nOn Wednesday, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed a bill to ban virtually all abortions in the state, unless the mother's life is in danger. As passed, the law would take effect in six months.\nWhen pressed during the bill's debate on what would happen to a victim of incest, Republican State Sen. Clyde Chambliss said his hope is \"that all young ladies would be educated by their parents, their guardians that should a situation like this occur, you need to go get help \u2014 you need to do it immediately.\"\nProtesters against the anti-abortion bill, dressed as handmaids, at the Alabama State House in Montgomery, Ala, last month. (Mickey Welsh/Montgomery Advertiser/AP)\nZirlott said his comments show \"an abysmal lack of knowledge about the nature of trauma for so many victims of assault.\"\n\"It effectively takes away your voice,\" she said. \"The silence inserts itself into you and you can't always reach out and ask for help.\"\n\"It's just complete wilful ignorance on their behalf, to imagine that this bill helps those victims at all,\" she said.\nRoe vs. Wade was 'an abomination'\nThe legislation that came from Roe vs. Wade is 'an abomination,' said Rick Renshaw, the political director for the The Alliance for a Pro-Life Alabama. (Submitted by Rick Renshaw)\nSupporters of the legislation say it is intentionally designed to conflict with the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationally, because they hope to spark a court case that might prompt the justices to revisit abortion rights.\n\"It was a terrible law when it was passed, it's a terrible law now. It's an abomination,\" said Rick Renshaw, the political director for the Alliance for a Pro-Life Alabama, a coalition of groups opposed to abortion in the state.\nThe new legislation \"protects the sanctity of unborn life,\" he said.\nHe argued that many people in Alabama were \"elated\" that the bill had been signed, and that years of work had \"finally come to fruition.\"\n\"This is in a sense righting something that's been wrong for a long, long time.\"\nZirlott said that politicians and pro-life activists like Renshaw don't understand the grief and trauma that can come with pregnancy resulting from assault.\n\"[Renshaw] was not there for those nights I spent watching Zoe slowly suffer and die for a year in front of me,\" she said.\n\"The politicians who have passed this law can't even begin to comprehend the circumstances that we're coming to seek care under.\"\nAnti-abortion marchers rally at the Supreme Court during the 46th annual March for Life in Washington in January. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\nWave of state bills\nLauren Rankin, a writer and pro-choice activist, said that several other states are also pursuing abortion restrictions, with bills \"designed to challenge Roe vs. Wade, and have the Supreme Court eventually overturn it.\"\nShe explained that \"with Brett Kavanaugh's appointment in the fall \u2026 the balance of power really shifted, and so now we have a 5-4 split in favour of conservative anti-abortion policies.\"\nShe told Tremonti that pro-choice activists are fighting the bills in court, but are worried that the Supreme Court \"will use Alabama's total law, as sort of a straw man to say, 'This is too severe, we won't support that but we would support a six-week ban.'\"\n\"Even if they don't actually overturn Roe vs. Wade, it is undeniable that this Supreme Court will allow seemingly more benign but more pernicious restrictions on abortion ... that will render legal abortion meaningless for millions of people.\"\nClick 'listen' near the top of this page to hear the full conversation.\nWritten by Padraig Moran, with files from the Associated Press.

            "LONDON, ENGLAND - JANUARY 29: Ryan Sessegnon of Fulham celebrates during the Premier League match between Fulham and Brighton & Hove Albion at Craven Cottage on January 29, 2019 in London, United Kingdom. (Photo by Clive Rose/Getty Images)\nAfter an inconsistent season with Fulham, the young fullback/winger is looking to move on, with Tottenham the front-runners to land Ryan Sessegnon.\nHe made 35 appearances in the Premier League this season, operating all over the park for the eventually doomed London side. Sessegnon was not at fault for Fulham\u2019s demise, contributing six goals and two assists, equating to 23 percent of his club\u2019s league goals. That, though, shows just how anemic Fulham\u2019s offensive output was.\nMainly a left winger, Sessegnon also deputized heavily at left back, two positions where Spurs need reinforcement. Still 18 years old until tomorrow, May 18th, he is a highly rated, dynamic prospect, regardless of the difficulties he faced in his first Premier League campaign. With rumors of Danny Rose\u2019s possible departure rampant, Tottenham are in the market for another left back, and Sessegnon fits the bill.\nHowever, with his contract set to expire next summer, Fulham will not want to lose out on a transfer fee and will probably look to sell to a top PL club for top dollar. Transfermarkt puts his value at around $39.9m, but Spurs and Daniel Levy will look for a discounted rate. Fulham, however, have reportedly set an initial asking price of \u00a340 million.\nSpurs have had a longstanding interest in Sessegnon, with him previously turning down a move to North London. He preferred to stay with Fulham and was a key reason the west Londoners achieved promotion in 2018.\nWhile interest from Manchester United, PSG and Juventus is heating up, Tottenham are still the frontrunners.\nAccording to BBC\u2019s David Ornstein, Spurs want to complete the signing soon, and prefer him in a left back role. Ornstein reports, however, that Tottenham have not made a formal bid yet.\nSessegnon\u2019s versatility bolsters highly his market value. His best current position is farther forward, but he can easily drop deeper, much like Rose did when he first arrived from Leeds.\nHe also offers more in attack than Rose and Ben Davies, a crucial facet to the club\u2019s playing style. This season the fullbacks weren\u2019t always positive in the final third and a change is needed for improvement. Whether on the wing or in defense, Sessegnon can be a difference maker, as he was in the Championship two seasons ago.\nRyan\u2019s twin, Steven, is also plays for Fulham and there are quiet rumors he could be part of a deal to bring them both to Spurs.\nTottenham must match their accomplishments this season with an ambitious and active transfer market. Having not signed anyone since Lucas in January 2018, new players are needed to keep the squad fresh and competitive.\nCompleting this signing could push the club on this summer, bringing even more success next season."

            "The Kenya Cup season comes to a close this afternoon with 2016 champions Kabras seeking to dethrone holders KCB at the Kakamega showground.\nThis will be the first ever that the final is being contested from the traditional venue in Nairobi after hosts Kabras topped the standings after the regular rounds.\nThe two sides will be meeting in the final for the fourth time with the bankers having won all the three previous encounters. In 2015 KCB won 27-3 at the RFUEA ground and the bankers winning on home turf 36-8 in 2017 and last year 29-24.\nThe sugarmillers are yet to beat the bankers in nine meetings with the best result for the hosts being a 15-15 draw in December 2016. The two sides met in the group phase in February at the Impala Club in arguably the game of the season, with KCB winning 44-20.\nKabras, who were formed in 2014 bagged the Kenya Cup crown in 2016, beating Impala 22-5 in the final and have played in every Kenya Cup competition since promotion to the top tier in 2015.\nKabras coach Hennley Du Plessis has urged his charges to seize the moment and create history by winning the crown.\n\"Our first objective was to top the group phase and have the final played at home and we have done that. Now we must complete the job on home soil,\u201d said Du Plessis.\nHe has urged his charges to attack space and not be involved in arm wrestles with the big KCB forwards.\n\"We learnt our lessons from the last time we played KCB. We want to stick to our game plan and structure and hopefully carry the day,\u201d he added.\nThe South African tactician has made three changes with Uganda Cranes skipper Asman Mugerwa starting in the front row, replacing Hilary Mwanjilwa while Charlton Mokua is at second row in place of Brian Juma. Internationals Dan Sikuta and George Nyambua will be in the back row.\nUgandan import Phillip Wokorach, Nick Barasa and Fijian Jone Kubu will be the star men in the backs.\nOn their part, KCB have named an unchanged side for the final. Skipper Curtis Lilako, Oliver Mang'eni, Andrew Amonde and Peter Waitere are the forwards with Samuel Asati, Ken Moseti Peter Kilonzo and Tony Onyango the key men in the backs.\nKCB coach Curtis Olago said defence will be key in what is expected to be an explosive encounter.\n\"Our defence has been superb this season and I expect to be the difference in the final,\u201d added Olago.\nLilako noted the pressure is on the hosts. \"The pressure is on Kabras. They will be at home and the expectation to win will be high on them. We simply need to play our game,\" said Lilako.\nThe match will be preceded by the Championship final pitting Western Bulls and Kisumu RFC at 2 pm."

            "Days after openly breaking from many of her conservative colleagues and publicly criticizing Alabama's new, heavily restrictive anti-abortion law, conservative commentator Tomi Lahren has published a new op-ed expanding on why she is going against the GOP grain in this matter.\nAlabama Governor Kay Ivey signed the bill, which effectively bans the procedure in the state and contains no exceptions for rape or incest, into law Wednesday, setting off a nationwide uproar over what is widely considered to be the strictest anti-abortion law in the country.\nLahren, one of the most prominent voices in conservative media, first expressed her departure from many other anti-abortion Republicans on Twitter, declaring that the \"Alabama abortion ban is too restrictive. It doesn't save life, it simply forces women into more dangerous methods, other states or countries.\"\nAmid backlash from her conservative peers for that Tweet, Lahren on Saturday delivered an op-ed for Fox News explaining stance on abortion rights.\n\"I don't believe the government does many things well, including regulating health care,\" the 26-year-old wrote. \"If the pro-life movement really wants to support women to ultimately choose life when making the most difficult decision they've ever had to make, do you really think a government mandate is the way to do it?\"\nIn a nod to her conservative supporters, Lahren advocated for reducing the incidence of abortion through referrals to \"crisis pregnancy centers\" and \"churches\" rather than through outright prohibition.\nCrisis pregnancy centers are typically religiously-affiliated institutions that counsel women who may be considering an abortion away from the procedure and into going through with their pregnancy. These centers have been accused of marketing their services deceptively by initially leading potential clients to believe that they are an abortion provider.\nCalifornia passed a law in 2015 that required crisis centers in the state to more fully disclose their services, but that regulation was enjoined by the Supreme Court last year, and litigation over the disclosures remains ongoing in the lower courts.\nIn her new column, Lahren cited statistics showing that outlawing abortion \"does not prevent it\" and added that restrictions generally serve to make the procedure \"unsafe and usually unsupervised.\"\n\"Does that seem like the answer?\" she asked her supporters.\nLahren apparently has a different view of the politics of abortion than many of her conservative peers, who see abortion restrictions as a galvanizing issue for the evangelical right. According to her, an attempt to use these statewide bans as a vehicle for the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade would \"be the nail in the coffin of Trump 2020.\"\n\"And to the pro-choice conservatives out there who feel they can't speak up on this for fear of being called a 'fake conservative,' a 'baby killer' or anything else, I encourage you to find your voice and use it,\" Lahren said. \"The great thing about the conservative movement is that we welcome differences of opinion, or at least we should.\""

            "Bill Shorten\u2019s lost in WA, failing to deliver the five seats he so desperately wanted and needed to win.\nWith many votes still to be counted, the Labor Party was at risk of not adding to the five seats Labor already held here.\nBefore yesterday, Labor held five out of 16 Federal seats in WA.\nLabor had boasted it had a good chance of winning Pearce, Hasluck, Swan, Stirling and even Canning.\nBut in sync with much of the country, Mr Shorten hadn\u2019t done enough to convince voters on this side of the country to give him the keys to the Lodge.\nOnly Swan appeared to be in play for Labor last night, with Hannah Beazley still in with a chance of beating Liberal incumbent Steve Irons.\nMs Beazley was not expected to concede defeat last night. There had been a swing of just under one per cent against Mr Irons at 8.30pm, with 45 per cent of the votes counted.\nShe would wait for pre-polling results.\nAnd Anne Aly, in Cowan, was fighting for survival.\nA senior Liberal source last night confided the party\u2019s internal polling had shown a narrow victory to the Coalition.\nThe source said the Liberals would hold Swan, Stirling and Hasluck and they had not given up on winning Cowan.\nThe insider said Pearce and Canning had never been in doubt.\nIn perhaps the story of the election in WA, Pearce MP and Liberal heavyweight Christian Porter saved his northern suburbs seat and his career.\nThere had been a swing of about 3 per cent towards him.\nGiven no chance of retaining the seat six months ago, Mr Porter was on course to defeat his Labor opponent, former police superintendent Kim Travers.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there was a single political commentator six months ago who gave us a chance,\u201d he said as he cast his vote in Ellenbrook.\nLast night he said the past three or four years had become particularly challenging as his seat went from 70 per cent country towns down to 30 per cent in recent years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very different seat to when it was created,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt is a different seat from six years ago when I was elected.\u201d\nLabor\u2019s planned changes to the housing market were big drivers behind the Pearce vote, with large numbers of young mortgage holders across the sprawling northern suburbs and more house building in the Swan Valley.\n\u201cLabor\u2019s housing tax was critical to my electorate,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s been very soft house prices post the boom, so the idea that someone would deliberately come and tax owning another property which would drive buyers out of the market was something I was at pains to explain to all of my constituents, and its likely to have had an impact in my seat and others in WA as well.\u201d\nA senior Labor source told The Sunday Times yesterday the arrival of Scott Morrison as Liberal leader and Prime Minister last August had \u201cbeen a game changer in WA\u201d.\n\u201cThe Coalition ship was about to go down, heading towards and iceberg when Malcolm Turnbull was prime minister,\u201d the Labor source said.\n\u201cThen they changed captains and while the ship still hit an iceberg they managed to save some lives.\u201d\nWA Treasurer Ben Wyatt, who joined Labor supporters at Ms Beazley\u2019s campaign function in Belmont, last night said: \u201cWe can\u2019t hide away from it, it is an extremely disappointing result (nationally).\n\u201cThere is no doubt the entire Labor community will be incredibly disappointed with what we\u2019ve seen tonight.\n\u201cIn WA we have done better than we have in some time in certain seats, certainly I don\u2019t think we will have a result in Swan or Stirling tonight.\n\u201cWe may win both of those seats but it will likely come down to pre-poll votes.\u201d\nSWAN\nCamera Icon Steve Irons. Credit: Justin Benson-Cooper\nIron-man sees off another challenger\nHannah Beazley\u2019s bid to launch a third chapter in her famous family\u2019s political dynasty appeared destined for the scrap heap last night.\nAs results from the Eastern States indicated a shock swing towards Scott Morrison and the Coalition, Ms Beazley\u2019s supporters gathered at her campaign HQ in Belmont were deflated.\nTony Abbott\u2019s concession speech drew hearty cheers, but they were quickly replaced by downcast faces as early counting in the seat of Swan had Liberal incumbent Steve Irons on track to win a fifth term.\nHowever, in an electorate heavily divided on political lines between suburbs such as South Perth and Como on one hand and Belmont and High Wycombe on the other, results from different booths swung the contest wildly first one way and then the next. At time of print Mr Irons had suffered a swing of 1.4 per cent against him but was on track to retain the seat.\n\u201cWhat is this rubbish,\u201d one elderly gentleman in a Beazley T-shirt said, shaking his head as national results appeared to depict an unlikely victory for Mr Morrison. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it again. The last time we had an election all we had to do was win three seats here (in WA) and we couldn\u2019t do it then either,\u201d he said.\nMs Beazley arrived at her function just after 8.30pm to rapturous applause, declining to concede defeat but admitting the count was not what she had hoped for.\n\u201cIt looks like we have a bit of a swing to us, we don\u2019t know if it is enough and I have been told there are too many votes still to count for us to know for sure,\u201d she said. \u201cSo unfortunately I come here to you with no result.\n\u201cI have grown up with a belief that if you see a hole you fill it. If you see something that can be done better you put your hand up and you try and do it. That is what we did here in Swan.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a politician, yet, so I can keep it short and sweet. I\u2019m really sorry I couldn\u2019t do this for Bob (Hawke) but I hope we can next time.\u201d\nPERTH\nCamera Icon Patrick Gorman celebrates. Credit: Daniel Wilkins\nGorman ahead in Perth\nPerth Labor MP Patrick Gorman was set to retain his seat last night, holding off Liberal challenger Jim Grayden during early counting.\nThe incumbent won the seat with a 3.3 per cent margin in a by-election after Tim Hammond resigned last year.\nGorman led the inner-city electorate on 55 per cent of the vote with 54.9 per cent of the ballots counted at time of printing.\nThe former WA Labor secretary, who is sharing his election night party with incumbent MP for Cowan Anne Aly, was hesitant to express confidence at his chances of re-election.\n\u201cMy advice to everyone is do not have too many celebration drinks too early. Pace yourself. It\u2019s going to be a long night,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis is my first time for re-election since a strange by-election last year.\u201d\nBRAND\nKing ahead despite swing\nLABOR member for Brand Madeleine King, pictured, looked likely to retain the Federal seat for her party last night, leading with 57.8 per cent of the vote at time of printing with 49.1 per cent of all votes counted. Widely viewed as one of the ALP\u2019s safest seats, the party has held Brand since its creation in 1984. Labor experienced a swing of 3.7 per cent against it, but still maintained a healthy buffer.\nMs King replaced former member Gary Gray, who made the decision not to re-contest in 2016.\nMOORE\nA bit Moore of the same\nThe Liberal Party was once again good enough for Moore\u2019s voters, who were set to return incumbent Ian Goodenough as their representative for a third term last night.\nMr Goodenough held his two-party preferred vote at about 61.64 per cent.\nThis was despite losing primary votes to One Nation.\nLabor candidate Tony O\u2019Gorman failed make any substantial ground for Labor, gaining 38.36 per cent of the vote once preferences were counted.\nThe outcome was a flashback of 2016, where almost identical results of about 61 per cent to 39 cent in Mr Goodenough\u2019s favour were recorded.\nCANNING\nCamera Icon Federal Member for Canning Andrew Hastie. Credit: Daniel Wilkins\nLabor\u2019s Hastie retreat\nAndrew Hastie said he was in shock at the Liberals\u2019 stunning results across Australia as the former SAS soldier retained his seat in Canning.\nThe returning Liberal MP paid credit to Prime Minister Scott Morrison for getting the Coalition over the line.\n\u201cWho would have thought we would be here tonight, I\u2019m still shocked,\u201d he said.\n\u201c(Mr Morrison) is a man who deeply cares about Australian people, he is an excellent leader he has great instincts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an overwhelming result, a result we can all be proud of.\u201d\nCanning was initially billed as one of Labor\u2019s five target seats on its WA hit-list.\nHeld on a margin of 6.8 per cent, Canning had the longest odds of the five Labor hoped would fall its way.\nWith 52 per cent of the vote counted last night, Mr Hastie was ahead of Labor candidate Mellisa Teede 62-38 per cent.\n\u201cWe have a lot of resources here, people are concerned about our long-term security and sovereignty, so when I go to Canberra I make sure the Commonwealth Government has its back,\u201d Mr Hastie said.\nEarlier in the day, the ex-serviceman said he had been \u201cquietly confident\u201d he would be returned.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a peri-urban seat and it\u2019s a very mixed demographic \u2014 we have a lot of workers down here, FIFO workers, seniors, pensioners, working families, so it made sense for Labor to make a play early on but we did the work,\u201d he said.\nThere was a jovial mood among Liberal volunteers at their Mandurah Country Club function last night as the reality they were likely to hold on to Government became apparent.\n\u201cThings have really come together under Scott Morrison, he has been a great leader, and exceptional campaigner,\u201d Mr Hastie said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s really balanced the party and signalled to a lot of working families he is a leader they can trust to look after them and their welfare.\u201d\nMs Teede started her election day by voting in Byford before travelling to Mandurah at the close of polls. Cheers subsided among the Labor faithful as the results came in.\nHASLUCK\nCamera Icon Ken Wyatt. Credit: Danella Bevis\nKen a winner four sure\nKen Wyatt declared victory in Hasluck last night.\nPredictions of a tight contest did not come to pass, with early counting showing the Minister for Aged Care on track to comfortably retain his seat with a swing of 2.7 per cent as at 10.30pm last night.\nMr Wyatt said he was surprised at the Coalition\u2019s strong showing because pre-election polling predicted a Labor win, but said the franking credits issue was a problem for Bill Shorten.\n\u201cPeople were starting to worry about the impact the franking credits and the loss of that income which was important,\u201d Mr Wyatt said.\n\u201cPeople want certainty, and I don\u2019t think the Leader of the Opposition explained his costings as well as he could.\u201d\nMr Wyatt made history in 2013 by becoming the first Member for Hasluck to be re-elected for a second term, and he did it again by winning\nHasluck for a third term three years later.\nMr Wyatt held Hasluck with a 2.1 per cent margin after the last election, but the latest polling ahead of yesterday\u2019s poll suggested the seat was 50-50 on a two-party preferred basis between Wyatt and Labor candidate James Martin.\nMr Wyatt said earlier in the week that cost-of-living pressures and protecting the Hills environment were key issues that Hasluck voters had raised with him during this campaign.\n\u201cPeople were talking about things that were important to them, I\u2019ve always operated on the basis I don\u2019t care whether it\u2019s State government, local government or Federal political issues, I will fight for the people of Hasluck on any of those matters,\u201d he said.\nHasluck covers Perth suburbs including Midland, Glen Forrest, Mount Helena, Mundaring, Kalamunda, Maida Vale, Forrestfield and Kenwick.\nMany voters said cost of living and managing the economy were key factors in who they voted for. And the battle for one of WA\u2019s most marginal seats has been high on drama.\nMr Wyatt had former prime minister John Howard by his side to add some star power in the lead-up to the election, but his campaign was marred by reports of a toxic work environment including claims of bullying and intimidation within his office, and questions over a $750,000 staff travel bill in 18 months.\nMeanwhile, Labor\u2019s original candidate Lauren Palmer quit just months out from the election, leaving the party scrambling for a new nominee before settling on Mr Martin, a Shire of Mundaring councillor and software company director.\nWhen he first won Hasluck at the 2010 election, Mr Wyatt became the first indigenous Australian to be elected to the House of\nRepresentatives, and he now runs the aged care, seniors and indigenous health portfolios.\nBURT\nCamera Icon Matt Keogh.

It was Wanneroo. I don\u2019t know who did it but the attitude I take is that there will be people who don\u2019t like you \u2014 and you don\u2019t need to focus on that.\n\u201cYou need to focus on the love and support you have and surround yourself with that.\u201d\nLikewise yesterday, Liberal supporters in Cowan were saying their confidence was growing that Mr Steward, a first-time candidate, could claim back the seat.\nA YouGov Galaxy poll conducted for The West Australian last week showed Dr Aly would increase her margin in the seat by 2.3 per cent.\nBut former Liberal State government minister Paul Miles, who was volunteering at the Wanneroo pre-polling station, said Cowan was now too close to call.\n\u201cI think the change of prime minister has really invigorated our party and I think people have seen that,\u201d Mr Miles said. \u201cScott Morrison is able to connect with people while some politicians are disconnected.\n\u201cFrom my point of view, it\u2019s too close to call in Cowan. A few months ago I would have thought it was over. Now, nobody can tell you.\u201d\nMr Stewart is employed by the West Australian Football Commission as a community development manager working with local football clubs.\nPEARCE\nCamera Icon Pearce candidate Christian Porter. Credit: Will Russell\nNegative gearing plan decisive: Porter\nAttorney-General Christian Porter has easily held his northern suburbs seat of Pearce, with the frontbencher pointing to Bill Shorten\u2019s planned changes to negative gearing rules as the issue that hit home with locals.\nSpeaking before a room of jubilant supporters at a campaign party in Mindarie, Mr Porter revealed that he had made a secret promise to his campaign team he would get a tattoo if he increased his margin.\n\u201cI will be getting ink,\u201d he told the cheering crowd.\nMr Porter claimed a strong win against Labor\u2019s candidate Kim Travers, despite predictions his seat might have been one of a number in WA that could fall to Labor.\nAt the point of declaring victory, Mr Porter had attracted a swing of almost 3 per cent \u2014 holding 56 per cent of the vote on a two-party preferred basis. Joined on stage by his wife Jennifer, Mr Porter said his team had run a tight, grass roots campaign.\n\u201cThis has been the sort of campaign they said they would bring against us,\u201d he said.\nMr Porter also paid tribute to his father Charles \u201cChilla\u201d Porter, who he said was watching from home and undergoing cancer treatment.\nMr Porter mused about polling which had consistently pointed to a Labor win nationally, with the Attorney-General suggesting surveys had missed issues happening at a micro level.\n\u201cWhat polls in Australia at least don\u2019t seem very good at doing is predicting things at a more granular level,\u201d Mr Porter said.\n\u201cAnd States in Australia are very different from one another.\u201d\nMr Porter cited what he called Labor\u2019s \u201chousing tax\u201d as the main factor in the battle for Pearce \u2014 a reference to the Opposition\u2019s plan to restrict negative gearing to newly build properties. \u201cMy observation is that Australians who have a mortgage don\u2019t like being taxed more,\u201d Mr Porter said.\nAsked about the apparent poor showing of Clive Palmer\u2019s United Australia Party, despite all the millions the businessman had spent on advertising, Mr Porter said:\n\u201cThat would have to be something you ask him (Mr Palmer) and his shareholders.\u201d\nEarlier yesterday, the minister took aim at his Labor opponent, former police\nsuperintendent Kim Travers, over her election posters that showed images of her in uniform. Mr Porter revealed he raised the issue with Police Commissioner Chris Dawson on Friday night, as the politicisation of the police force was not allowed.\nHe said Mr Dawson had taken action on this matter.\n\u201cIt is a well-known requirement that where WA Police officers are candidates for political election, they may not use images or vision of themselves in WA Police uniform in any campaign material or context,\u201d Mr Porter said in a statement yesterday.\n\u201cIt is totally inappropriate to politicise the WA Police Force. Bill Shorten\u2019s candidate should know this.\u201d\nMr Dawson revealed he had received two complaints on Friday and had contacted Ms Travers \u2014 a recipient of the Australian Police Medal in 2015 \u2014 to relay his concern and disappointment.\n\u201cMs Travers is no longer a police officer,\u201d Mr Dawson said. \u201cShe was required to resign from WA Police Force in order to stand as a candidate in the election. I expressed my view to Ms Travers that the posters adversely politicised WA Police and that the force should always be regarded as apolitical.\u201d\nIt\u2019s understood Labor began to remove the posters at the Commissioner\u2019s request, but claims they complied with AEC requirements.\nA Labor spokesperson defended Ms Travers\u2019 record as a police officer and a proud candidate.\nMr Porter, who held the seat with a 3.6 per cent margin and came to the contest reportedly armed with a large war chest of campaign funding, said he believed he would win the seat as the Liberals were selling a \u201csuperior product\u201d to local voters.\nSeats like Pearce were said to be central to the Government\u2019s preference deal with Mr Palmer. The battle has attracted national interest, with Mr Shorten citing the seat early in the contest as one of the WA seats that Labor should be aiming to win as part of his path to The Lodge.\nFREMANTLE\nCamera Icon Member for Fremantle Josh Wilson.

Credit: Notre Dame University\nCurtin held by Liberals\nLiberal Celia Hammond last night cruised to victory in WA\u2019s safest Liberal seat, claiming the seat of Curtin from departing former foreign minister Julie Bishop.\nHowever, the Liberals, who previously held the blue-ribbon seat with a 20 per cent margin, had suffered a 6.8 per cent swing against it as at 8pm.\nMs Hammond said she was \u201cincredibly grateful\u201d for her entire campaign team.\n\u201cEveryone, all the volunteers, have done an incredible job and I\u2019m so thankful for all the encouragement and support,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been exhilarating.\u201d\nAt 8pm, the 50-year-old lawyer and former vice-chancellor of Notre Dame University was leading with 63.9 per cent of the vote, with 20.8 per cent of votes counted.\nProfessor Hammond arrived at the Cottesloe Beach Hotel about 6.30pm, where a crowd of more than 100 supporters, family and friends had gathered at the end of a successful campaign.\nVictory cries could be heard from outside the pub.\nIn between warm embraces, congratulatory hugs, selfies with eager supporters and sips of champagne, Professor Hammond said she had tried to maintain a \u201cpositive campaign that represented this positive country\u201d.\n\u201cI want to follow on from Julie, who was just magnificent,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI want to follow in her footsteps. (She) just was such a passionate advocate for her constituents.\u201d\nDespite the backing by prominent conservatives, including Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, Professor Hammond has previously been criticised as being too conservative for the affluent electorate, which had one of the highest votes in favour of same-sex marriage in the country during the plebiscite in 2017.\nBut Professor Hammond last night brushed those concerns aside, saying she was there to represent the people who did vote for her and the people who didn\u2019t.\n\u201cI\u2019m here to represent everybody,\u201d she said.\nIndependent Louise Stewart last night said her campaign had been \u201cvery challenging\u201d.\nThe 43-year-old said during the six weeks, \u201csome dirty tricks were played\u201d, referring to several media reports that undoubtedly put a damper on her campaign.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be addressing it after the election,\u201d Ms Stewart said, adding she had already been in talks with lawyers regarding \u201cunbalanced reporting\u201d.\nTHE REGIONS\nCamera Icon Member for Forest Nola Marino. Credit: Harvey Reporter\nCountry comfort for Libs\nThe WA Liberals have strengthened their grip on our State\u2019s outback electorates, with incumbent members already on 10 per cent-plus margins tipped to boost their primary votes last night.\nCriticism of going missing during the campaign appears to have done Durack MHR Melissa Price no harm.\nLast night Ms Price was sitting on about 63 per cent of the two-party preferred vote with more than 48 per cent of votes counted. Her primary vote was up more than one per cent.\n\u201cFrankly I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve been looking very hard,\u201d Ms Price said of those spearheading the \u2018missing minister\u2019 claims.\n\u201cAll you need to do is look on my Facebook and you\u2019ll be able to see exactly where I am.\n\u201cI think the people of Durack deserve me to be in the electorate because that is my number one priority.\u201d\nThe O\u2019Connor electorate \u2014 covering the Great Southern and Goldfields \u2014 was retained comfortably by Liberal Rick Wilson, who could enjoy a margin of about 15 per cent once votes are counted.\nForrest in the South West was also comfortably retained by the chief government whip Nola Marino for a fifth term.\nMs Marino\u2019s personal vote was up more than two per cent.\nBroome-based Yawuru man Patrick Dodson \u2014 hyped up as Australia\u2019s indigenous affairs minister in waiting before election day \u2014 appeared likely to retain his spot for Labor in the Senate. Senator Dodson said suicide rates, education, jobs and health were key concerns in need of addressing.\nOne Nation picked up about nine per cent of the vote in Durack and O\u2019Connor, and six per cent in Forrest.\n- With Peter De Kruijff, Nick Butterly, Tony Barrass, Lisa Thomas, Angela Pownall, Trevor Paddenburg, Toby Hussey, Tom Zaunmayr, Josh Zimmerman, Joanna Delalande and John Flint."

            "Johanna Konta defeated the sixth seed Kiki Bertens 5-7, 7-5, 6-2 in nearly three hours to reach the Italian Open final for the biggest clay-court result of her career.\nKonta\u2019s only previous final on clay came at the start of this month in Rabat, Morocco, where she was beaten by Greece\u2019s Maria Sakkari. This result in Rome against the player who last week won the Madrid Open title will give the British player even more confidence entering the French Open, which starts next weekend.\nIn Sunday\u2019s final, Konta will face fourth-seeded Karolina Pliskova after her 6-4, 6-4 win over Sakkari in the second semi-final.\nMidway through the first set, Konta surprised Bertens with a drop-shot winner during a baseline rally, causing Bertens to fall on her stomach to the clay as she rapidly changed directions. In the next game, Konta ran down a drop shot and produced an angled winner that drew a roar from the crowd.\nThe 42nd-ranked Konta served for the first set at 5-4 but was broken to love. However Bertens later double faulted to let Konta serve for the second set and Konta got an early break in the third.\n\u201cI knew going into the match against Kiki that she\u2019s playing some of the best tennis right now in her career. She came off of winning Madrid. She\u2019s definitely in amazing form. She\u2019s No 4 in the world. She\u2019s one of the best players right now,\u201d Konta said. \u201cI knew going out there that there wasn\u2019t going to be one solution. It wasn\u2019t going to be one answer or one specific game plan that was going to be, yeah, like: Wow, that\u2019s OK, I\u2019ve cracked it.\n\u201cIt was going to be a continuous adjustment, a continuous openness to figure it out within the match. I thought I did that well. I stayed very open in trying to find a solution in each point, in each ball. I just trusted that. I kind of accepted both ways. I mean, after I lost the first set, I didn\u2019t do much wrong. It was a very good set of tennis. Equally the second set. There wasn\u2019t anybody putting a bad foot out of line.\n\u201cIn the third, I definitely felt that I was able to maintain my level a bit better than her. I think that gave me the upper hand in stringing some more points together. I\u2019m just very happy to have come through.\u201d\nIn the men\u2019s event, Rafael Nadal looked more like his old, dominant self when he beat Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3, 6-4 to reach the final. It was a measure of revenge for Nadal after losing to Tsitsipas in three sets at this stage in Madrid last week, the last of three consecutive defeats for the Spaniard in the semi-finals clay-court tournaments.\nThis victory should also restore Nadal\u2019s confidence as he prepares to seek a record\u2011extending 12th title at the French Open.\nNadal, aiming for a ninth title at the Foro Italico, will now face Novak Djokovic who beat Diego Schwartzman 6-3, 6-7 (2), 6-3."

            "Insight\nRuling coalition made up of centre-right OVP and far-right FPO banned hijabs in schools, leading to an outcry by Muslims and civil rights campaigners.\nAustrian MPs on Wednesday approved a law aimed at banning the headscarf in primary schools, a measure proposed by the ruling right-wing government.\nSo as to avoid charges that the law discriminates against Muslims, the law refers to any \"ideologically or religiously influenced clothing which is associated with the covering of the head\".\nHowever, representatives of both parties of the governing coalition, the centre-right People's Party (OVP) and the far-right Freedom Party (FPO), have made it clear that the law targets headscarves worn by Muslim women.\nHere are some reactions from locals from Austria and Germany.\nTarek Bae, an independent journalist from Germany shared the following on Facebook:\n\u201cCritics of the law make comparisons with the Nazi era and in this case one should probably discuss this soberly. Without painting the devil on the wall, it is fair to say that prohibition policy is more reminiscent of the darker chapter of the last century in Europe.\nIn purely constitutional terms, therefore, prohibitions are more than just controversial among lawyers. Another explosive aspect is that it does not affect all types of headgear, which can have many political or religious reasons, but explicitly the headscarf.\u201d\nThe Syrian-born Austrian Muslim activist and writer, Tarafa Baghajati said: \"One thing remains 100 percent certain: This bill really has 0.0 percent to do with the well-being of the children.\"\nSabrina Dorn, a lecturer in Economic at the Swiss ETH Zurich, showed her solidarity with Muslim women wearing the hijab. She wrote: \"Dear [Austrian] government! Well, bite this! Banning the headscarf while allowing other religious symbols is incomprehensible and we should not tolerate the discrimination of the Muslim community in this country!\"\nShe was not the only one. Stefani Paulsen, a local Social Democrat Party member and a lecturer at the AStA University of Applied Sciences in Northern Germany Flensburg shared the following:\n\"The constant discussions about the headscarves are really unnecessary. I like to wear a headscarf and woe betide it becomes forbidden here (Germany). I'll probably emigrate.\"\nThe independent Austrian MP Martha Bissmann protested by wearing a hijab during her speech in the Austrian Parliament.\nShe later said: \"Let's not allow a wedge to be driven between us.\n\"I am decidedly against headscarf compulsion - whether in Iran or in Austrian elementary schools. Under no circumstances should a girl be forced to wear a headscarf.\"\nEmel Erdem, a linguist from Germany responded to Bissman's post:\n\"What a courageous gesture, what a courageous statement! They strengthen my belief in a peaceful coexistence - many thanks for that, all the best for their future and warm greetings from Germany!\"\nEmel Erdem, a Linguist and cultural scientist from Germany comments on the video post of the Independent Member of Austrian Parliament Martha Bissmann. (Facebook)\nAK Party MP, Mustafa Yeneroglu, who lives between Germany and Turkey expressed his disapproval:\n\"Allegedly, the headscarf ban is intended to prevent discrimination and exclusion; in fact, that is exactly what it aims to achieve. Muslims in Austria are increasingly being pushed out of society and Muslim religiosity is being criminalised. The law is aimed exclusively at Muslims. A liberal legal system does not show its qualities with ideologically motivated prohibitions, especially in dealing with minorities.\"\nMr Yeneroglu further thanked Mr Bissmann for supporting the Muslim community.\nSource: TRT World"

By extracting DNA from Ochoa-Lopez\u2019s toothbrush and hairbrush, detectives were able to confirm a match with the infant who was rushed to the hospital in April, her family told the Chicago Tribune. The baby, given the name Yadiel Yovany Lopez by the family, is on life support and has no brain function, family members said. Speaking to reporters outside the medical examiner\u2019s office on Wednesday night, Ochoa-Lopez\u2019s husband, Yovany Lopez, wept. \u201cWhy did these bad people do this?\u201d he asked. \u201cShe did nothing to them. She was a good person.\u201d\nShare this article in your social network\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below."

            "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\nHerman Wouk, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of the Navy drama \u201cThe Caine Mutiny,\u201d whose sweeping novels about World War II, the Holocaust and the creation of Israel made him one of the most popular writers of his generation and helped revitalize the genre of historical fiction, died May 17 at his home in Palm Springs, Calif. He was 103.\nHis literary agent, Amy Rennert, confirmed the death but did not provide a cause.\nMr. Wouk (his last name is pronounced \u201cWoke\u201d) penned a dozen novels, a handful of plays and several nonfiction books over the course of his nearly 60-year career. A meticulous researcher, he specialized in stories of personal conflict set against the backdrop of compelling historical events, including \u201cThe Caine Mutiny\u201d (1951), \u201cThe Winds of War\u201d (1971) and \u201cWar and Remembrance\u201d (1978). The latter two became ABC miniseries in the 1980s starring Robert Mitchum that averaged tens of millions of viewers over the course of their broadcast and were the highest-rated miniseries after Alex Haley\u2019s \u201cRoots.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nIn a form that the author would echo in other novels, \u201cThe Winds of War\u201d and its sequel, \u201cWar and Remembrance,\u201d trace World War II through the experiences of one family. \u201cThe Winds of War\u201d follows Navy officer Victor \u201cPug\u201d Henry and his relatives from the German invasion of Poland to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, where its sequel begins and then proceeds to the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan.\nThe pair of books established Mr. Wouk\u2019s legacy as a master of historical fiction, in which he blended the narrative power of fiction with great understanding and empathy for the human motivations behind wars and other historical events. The Economist magazine said \u201cThe Winds of War\u201d was \u201cas serious a contribution to the literature of our time as \u2018War and Peace\u2019 was to that of the nineteenth century.\u201d\nLibrarian of Congress James H. Billington said Mr. Wouk helped enliven history in ways that many academic tomes never could and prompted readers to examine the past through engaging fictional characters. \u201cI think he\u2019s been a seminal figure because he\u2019s recrafted the historical novel for a modern audience and not for some niche market,\u201d Billington, who died last year, told The Washington Post in an interview for this obituary.\nAdvertisement\nMr. Wouk, who said he was never a \u201chigh stylist,\u201d attracted a mass audience with books that espoused such values as gallantry and leadership under pressure. Leading critics sniffed at his books, which they often said broke no ground in writing style or character development.\nThe literary essayist Leslie Fiedler once explained Mr. Wouk\u2019s critical reputation by comparing him with Nobel laureate Saul Bellow. \u201cBellow, like most writers critics take seriously, attacked the basic values of middle-class Americans: easy piety, marriage, life in the suburbs,\u201d Fiedler said. \u201cWouk challenges nothing.\u201d\nMr. Wouk said he found nonconformity for its own sake an all-too predictable theme in modern literature and had no interest in experimental or temporarily trendy prose styles. \u201cI write a traditional novel, which is rather unfashionable, and I\u2019ve taken a lot of kicking for it,\u201d he once told The Post. \u201cBut the strength of my work comes from this intense grounding in the 18th- and 19th-century novelists.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHis very significance, wrote Time magazine in a 1955 cover story, was that \u201che spearheads a mutiny against the literary stereotypes of rebellion \u2014 against three decades of U.S. fiction dominated by skeptical criticism, sexual emancipation, social protest and psychoanalytic sermonizing.\u201d\nMr. Wouk began his professional career as a gag writer in the 1930s before moving to the staff of the popular radio comedian Fred Allen. He got that job in part for his notoriety at Columbia University, where his Class of 1934 yearbook named him the wittiest student. He later joked, \u201cIt was not a very sparkling class.\u201d\nEnlisting in the Navy during World War II proved a transformative experience in his development as a writer.\n\u201cMy life was broken at the time, as it was for all of our generation, by the coming of the war, and the winds of war swept a Bronx boy halfway around the world, below the equator, and he landed on an old destroyer minesweeper called the USS Zane,\u201d Mr. Wouk told a National Press Club audience. \u201cAnd that, I think, is where my adult education really began, because there, the hard shell of a New York wise guy cracked and fell off. The shallow conceit of a successful gag man faded away. . . . When I came back, there no longer was a question of a gag writing. I wanted to write novels.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe Caine Mutiny: A Novel of World War II\u201d in 1951 brought Mr. Wouk his first critical and popular success, including the Pulitzer. The book centers on a power struggle aboard the destroyer-minesweeper Caine, culminating in a young lieutenant seizing control of the vessel from the paranoid Capt. Queeg after the crew thinks it faces imminent danger.\nThe action culminates in a court-martial for the lieutenant. Although the novel raised questions of authority and duty versus personal freedom, the naval community embraced it. Queeg also became one of the most memorable characters of the day, a man who relieved his stress by obsessively rolling steel bearings in the palm of his hand.\nTime magazine called \u201cThe Caine Mutiny,\u201d which sold more than 5 million copies worldwide and was translated into 17 languages, the \u201cbiggest U.S. bestseller since \u2018Gone With the Wind.\u2019 \u201d A 1954 film adaptation of the novel, starring Humphrey Bogart as Queeg, became a popular hit, earning Bogart an Academy Award nomination.\nAdvertisement\nThe stage version of the courtroom scenes from \u201cThe Caine Mutiny,\u201d called \u201cThe Caine Mutiny Court-Martial,\u201d proved a Broadway success in the 1950s with Henry Fonda and Lloyd Nolan and remained a staple of community theaters, with productions as far away as China.\nMr. Wouk became further embedded in the cultural firmament with film adaptations of his other books, including \u201cMarjorie Morningstar,\u201d with Gene Kelly and Natalie Wood.\n\u201cMarjorie Morningstar,\u201d published in 1955, underscored another major aspect of Mr. Wouk\u2019s life: books whose themes were central to his Orthodox Jewish faith. \u201cMarjorie Morningstar,\u201d about a young Jewish woman who dreams of being an actress and eventually settles into a life as a suburban housewife, explores how Jews struggled to reconcile their faith with American society. It earned the public\u2019s affection, if not the critics\u2019, and it was credited with helping broaden interest in Jewish American novels later that decade by Philip Roth and others.\nAdvertisement\nHerman Wouk was born May 27, 1915, in the Bronx, which he once called \u201cthat romantic, and much overcriticized borough\u201d of New York. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Russia, and his father worked his way into the presidency of a laundry-chain business.\nAs a child, he told Time, he was the neighborhood fat boy forever being \u201cclobbered\u201d by street toughs. He found comfort in books that his mother bought from a traveling salesman when he was 12. In particular, he grew to love the writing of Mark Twain for his ability to make people laugh, even at matters of faith.\nThe arrival from Russia of his maternal grandfather, an Orthodox Jewish rabbi, would have a decisive influence on Mr. Wouk\u2019s beliefs and many of his later works of fiction and nonfiction.\nMr. Wouk decided at a young age that he wanted to be a writer. He wrote for the college humor magazine and several student musical comedy revues, one of which prompted a student critic to quip, \u201cAll Wouk and no play.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHe graduated in 1934 with majors in philosophy and comparative literature and took a $15-a-week job working for a man he called the \u201cczar of gag writers,\u201d who modernized and cleaned up old jokes and sold them to entertainers such as Eddie Cantor. Within a few years, he joined Fred Allen\u2019s comedy-writing team.\nMr. Wouk returned to comedy later in his career, collaborating with singer Jimmy Buffett on a musical based on Mr. Wouk\u2019s 1965 novel \u201cDon\u2019t Stop the Carnival,\u201d about a harried New York publicist who flees to the fictitious Caribbean island of Amerigo to run a resort hotel. The show became a crowd favorite when it opened in 1997 in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove Playhouse.\nAs war broke out in Europe, Mr. Wouk in 1941 worked on radio shows promoting purchases of war bonds before enlisting in the Navy. The experience, eventually as executive officer of the destroyer-minesweeper Southard, helped inspire \u201cThe Caine Mutiny.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMr. Wouk\u2019s first novel, \u201cAurora Dawn,\u201d was published in 1947. It started as a play he was writing while at sea during the war but evolved into a full-blown story about the life and romances of a radio advertising worker. Though the reviews were mixed, it was selected by the Book of the Month Club.\nHis next novel, \u201cCity Boy\u201d (1948), was about a Jewish youth from the Bronx whom Mr. Wouk based in part on himself. Then, in 1949 came the screenplay for the film \u201cSlattery\u2019s Hurricane,\u201d starring Richard Widmark as a man seeking to redeem himself by flying a reconnaissance mission in a hurricane. The book of the same title was published in 1956.\n\u201cThe Caine Mutiny\u201d proved the sensation that fully established Mr. Wouk's career. His later novels included \u201cYoungblood Hawke\u201d (1962), about an American writer who becomes a victim of his own success, and \u201cThe Hope\u201d (1993) and \u201cThe Glory\u201d (1994), which documented the struggle for Israeli statehood from the perspective of several fictional families. In 2012, Mr. Wouk published his last novel, \u201cThe Lawgiver,\u201d which revolves around the making of a screenplay about Moses and includes Mr. Wouk himself as a character. In 2016, he published a memoir, \u201cSailor and Fiddler: Reflections of a 100-Year-Old Author,\u201d and up until a month ago, he was working on another book.\nThe Library of Congress held events in honor of Mr. Wouk on multiple occasions, including naming him, in 2008, the recipient of its first lifetime achievement award for fiction writing. But he acknowledged that he wasn\u2019t much for being in the public spotlight or at large soirees, instead preferring to throw small dinners with his wife of more than 60 years, the former Betty Brown, who went by her Hebrew name, Sarah. Mrs. Wouk died in 2011, at 90.\nTheir son Abraham drowned as a child in 1951. Survivors include two children, Iolanthe Woulff and Joseph Wouk; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.\nMr. Wouk once joked in a speech that historical fiction is \u201cat best a bastard form and highly suspect.\u201d While his dedication to the genre earned him the respect of such scholars as historian David McCullough and Churchill biographer Martin Gilbert, Mr. Wouk said he recognized that his most important job was as a storyteller.\n\u201cA historical novel, to have any chance of lasting, must meet the highest standards of academic history,\u201d he told an audience in Melbourne, Australia, \u201cand then the novelist has to discard 90 percent of the history in order to tell the story.\u201d\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\nGiftOutline Gift Article"

            "Tonight\u2019s All-Star Open (6 p.m. ET, FS1) and Main Event (8 p.m. ET, FS1) are short-field events, with 24 drivers competing in the open, and 19 in the All-Star feature. That means head-to-head and other prop bets for the race weekend are a bit limited.\nAt the time of writing, no prop bets have been posted for the Open, and only head-to-head matchups are currently being offered for the main event.\nThankfully, there are a few good values among those matchup bets. If any other props get added closer to the drop of the green flag for the Open, I\u2019ll be sure to update this post with any additional bets I\u2019m making.\nKurt Busch +135 over Chase Elliott\nI\u2019m not sure why Busch is such a huge dog against Elliott, but Kurt could actually be the favorite when looking at the statistics. Busch has been a model of consistency, posting finishes of third, fifth, ninth and seventh, while Elliott has finishes of 19th, ninth, 13th and fourth over the same four 1.5-mile races in 2019, with no major incidents.\nBut looking beyond average finish, Kurt Busch is severely underrated this weekend. Here\u2019s a table showing how undervalued Busch is:\nWin Rnk: The ordinal ranking based on the current Westgate odds to win (with ties averaged among the drivers).\nThe ordinal ranking based on the current Westgate odds to win (with ties averaged among the drivers). AvgSpd: The average green flag speed ranking from the four 1.5-mile races this year.\nThe average green flag speed ranking from the four 1.5-mile races this year. SpdRnk: The ordinal ranking of AvgSpd for the drivers locked into the main event.\nThe ordinal ranking of AvgSpd for the drivers locked into the main event. Diff: The different between SpdRnk and WinRnk. A positive number means the driver has run better than the odds suggest.\nWe can see from the table that Kurt Busch is the most undervalued driver in the field, while Elliott is slightly overvalued. The elder Busch brother has a 6.75 average green flag speed rank while Elliott comes in at 9.75, yet somehow Busch is the dog.\nBusch also practiced faster than Elliott over 10-consecutive laps in final practice. I think Busch is the clear favorite and I\u2019d bet him down to -120.\nAric Almirola +105 over Erik Jones\nAlmirola has run 14 races at 1.5-mile tracks during his career at Stewart-Haas Racing (SHR). Twelve of those races have been incident-free, in which he\u2019s averaged a 9.25 finish, with a worst finish of 13th.\nAdditionally, in one of the two races he had an incident, he dominated a large portion of the race before a loose wheel took him out of contention. That\u2019s a model of consistency. Jones has also posted excellent finishes, with an average of 7.6 during the same span.\nBut I\u2019m banking on Almirola for a few reasons. Looking at average green flag speed for 2019 at the 1.5-mile tracks, Almirola checks in at 10.5 while Jones is at 12.0. Neither driver has had a major incident in those races, so this is an appropriate comparison.\nReferencing the table above, Almirola comes in as the second-most undervalued driver based on this metric relative to betting odds, while Jones is the third-most overvalued.\nAlmirola also ran 0.9 mph faster than Jones over 10-consecutive laps in final practice. He should be the favorite, not the dog. I\u2019d bet Almirola down to -110.\nBrad Keselowski -160 over Austin Dillon\nIt\u2019s rare I bet such a huge favorite in NASCAR head-to-head matchups, but this is as much of a lock as it gets if luck wasn\u2019t a factor. Of course, luck is a factor, so we need to determine how much randomness is inherent in the All-Star race.\nThe average incident rate at 1.5-mile tracks since 2013 when the Gen-6 car was introduced hovers just below 18%. During this same time frame, the All-Star race has an average incident rate of 16.8%. Certainly the segments will add a small amount of randomness to the process, but that randomness will be reduced a little bit with the final stage coming in at five laps longer than previous years.\nKeselowski should be an exceptionally strong favorite barring a major incident even with the added randomness. The table above says indicates why \u2014 Keselowski\u2019s 8.5-to-17.25 advantage in green flag speed, plus his average finish of 1.3 in his three incident-free 1.5-mile races in 2019 gives him a massive leg up on Dillon, whose best 1.5-mile finish is 14th.\nI\u2019d bet Keselowski down to -190."

Eintracht Frankfurt can be backed at 9/1 while a draw is available for 11/2.\nClick here to see more offers for the game, including goalscoring markets, correct score predictions and more.\nMatch Preview\nIn the 50th minute of Bayern\u2019s match with RB Leipzig last weekend, Leon Goretzka volleyed past goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi and sprinted off in celebration towards the corner flag.\nVictory would have guaranteed Bayern a seventh successive title with a game to spare and it seemed Goretzka had put them well on their way to three points. However, a VAR check by the officials revealed that Robert Lewandowski was marginally offside and the goal was ruled out.\nThe Bavarians were unable to find a breakthrough and were forced to accept the draw, keeping Borussia Dortmund\u2019s dreams of the title alive.\nDortmund began the day five points adrift in second but Bayern\u2019s draw combined with their win over Fortuna Dusseldorf means the gap is just two points going into the final weekend.\nThe title remains firmly in Bayern\u2019s hands though, with a draw virtually certain of being good enough given there needs to be a 17-goal swing for Dortmund to better their goal difference.\nIt presents Bayern the opportunity to secure the title at the Allianz Arena for the first time since they moved to the stadium 14 years ago, with their previous nine title wins all secured away from home. It would also be a fitting send off for Franck Ribery, Rafinha and Arjen Robben, who will leave the German giants at the end of the season.\nBayern striker Lewandowski admits sealing the title at home would make it that extra bit special.\n\u201cI've dreamed of winning the championship title in front of our own fans,\u201d he told Bayern\u2019s website. \u201cIt would be a great feeling, a nice moment.\n\u201cI know the feeling of winning the championship title on the road, but I think it's completely different at home, when the atmosphere is still hot and you don't celebrate after winning it two, three weeks beforehand. It can be special. I hope we can achieve it on Saturday, then we can celebrate with the fans.\u201d\nEven if Bayern secure the title it seems likely Kovac will leave the club at the end of the season having reportedly lost the confidence of the board and fallen out with a number of key players.\nThe title is not a formality either, as Frankfurt aren't the type of side that will simply lie down and allow Bayern to celebrate.\nAdi Hutter\u2019s outfit, which came within a penalty shootout of the Europa League final, still harbour hopes of qualifying for next season\u2019s Champions League.\nThey are in a four-way battle for the final qualification spot along with Monchengladbach, Bayern Leverkusen and Wolfsburg; though the latter\u2019s vastly inferior goal difference effectively rules them out of contention."

            "Sanchez has struggled to make an impact at United since signing [photo courtesy ]\nJuventus have reportedly begun negotiations with Manchester United for Chile forward Alexis Sanchez, who is one of many players possibly getting shipped out of United this summer.\nThe Chilean has struggled with injuries this year, and has found it hard to find a place in the team, with only two goals to his name all season.\nHe now joins the long list of problems, along with the list of players who might be out of there this summer.\nAlexis has also been linked with fellow Italians Inter Milan.\nSanchez this week apologised to United fans on the back of a poor season and, in a rabble-rousing post on social media, insisted they would return to the sort of glory days enjoyed under Sir Alex Ferguson.\nThe 30 year old was renowned at Arsenal for his incredible work rate, spectacular goals and never-say-die spirit on the pitch. He epitomised the South American style of striker, and the hunger and desire were there for all to see.\nBut he seems to have lost that part of his game amid all the cash.\nThere were warning signs at Arsenal, with talk of him being a diva, hard to manage \u2014 and also losing his motivation after Chile failed to qualify for last summer's World Cup.\nEveryone was convinced a fresh start at United would relight his fire but it did not pan out like that and he looks a pale shadow of his old self."

            "DETROIT (AP) \u2014 The grisly act is rare, yet it's common enough to have a name: fetal abduction.\nThanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors\nThe latest case out of Chicago \u2014 in which 19-year-old Marlen Ochoa-Lopez was strangled and her baby cut from her womb \u2014 has similarities to many of the roughly 30 similar crimes carried out over the last three decades across the U.S., an expert said.\nOf the roughly 30 documented fetal abduction cases between 1987 and 2015, most of the mothers were slain and it\u2019s typical for them to have been stalked or lured somewhere under false pretenses \u2014 including for free supplies, according to Kenna Quinet, an associate criminal justice professor at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. In Ochoa-Lopez's case, police and family members say she was killed after responding to a Facebook offer of free baby clothes. Her infant son is hospitalized in grave condition and is not expected to survive.\nQuinet, who co-authored the homicide textbook \u201cThe Will to Kill: Making Sense of Senseless Murder,\u201d said it\u2019s as illogical as it is horrific: She\u2019s unaware of any case of \u201cmurder by C-section,\u201d as she describes it, in which the baby wasn\u2019t found and the crime wasn\u2019t discovered.\n\u201cClearly, you\u2019re not getting away with this,\u201d she said. \u201cThese women are clearly delusional.\u201d\nAuthorities charged a Chicago woman on Thursday with murder for allegedly strangling 19-year-old Marlen Ochoa-Lopez with a cord and cutting an infant from her womb. Clarisa Figueroa, 46, apparently wanted to raise another child two years after her adult son died of natural causes, investigators said.\nFigueroa\u2019s 24-year-old daughter, Desiree Figueroa, also was charged with murder. Her boyfriend, 40-year-old Piotr Bobak, was charged with concealment of a homicide.\nQuinet said it\u2019s most often a case of a perpetrator making \u201can extremely dysfunctional, controlling, psychotic attempt to keep a man in a relationship,\u201d or they\u2019re suffering from what Quinet calls \u201cmotherhood by proxy.\u201d That\u2019s also the name of a section in her book and a play on Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a form of abuse where the person supposed to care for the individual makes up or causes the condition.\nThe cases come along an average of once a year, with some gaps. It\u2019s even occurred before in Chicago, in 1995. That nearly full-term baby survived, but the mother, Debra Evans, and two of her other children were killed. Three people were convicted.\nQuinet\u2019s research shows that most babies survive, but far fewer of their mothers do. She found eight women who did, including one who escaped and killed the woman trying to kill her and take the baby.\nQuinet said she can\u2019t find a definitive case before 1987. She said that correlates to a time in which hospitals boosted their security, significantly decreasing the number of newborns stolen from maternity wards or neo-natal units.\nWhile fetal abduction endures, she said it\u2019s important to note that it remains infrequent and shows no sign of increasing.\n\u201cIf you consider an extremely rare event of the millions of women a year who are pregnant, there would be no way as individual people that we could take this risk to zero,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s as low as we can hope for it to be.\u201d\nRelated stories:\nPolice: 3 Charged in Murder of Pregnant Teen Marlen Ochoa-Lopez\nPregnant Chicago Woman Slain, Baby Cut From Her Womb\nChicago Police Offer First Look at 2019 Summer Safety Strategies\nThanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors"

            "Less than one month after surgery to remove loose bodies in his right elbow, Nathan Eovaldi is throwing again.\nEovaldi threw from flat ground on Friday afternoon before the Red Sox began their three-game weekend set with the Houston Astros.\nThe series should be a good barometer for success given the Astros\u2019 29-15 record, but without Eovaldi in the rotation the Sox will have a bullpen game on Saturday, when Hector Velazquez will make another abbreviated start.\nBut soon enough their World Series hero could be back on the mound. He said he\u2019s been throwing for three or four days.\n\u201cMy arm feels great,\u201d Eovaldi said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to take it slow with everything and just make sure we build up the right way.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, he\u2019ll throw his first bullpen session since surgery.\nBecause he was able to prepare himself for the season and stretch his arm out to 104 pitches before the surgery, Eovaldi feels like he won\u2019t need much time to get back into game shape.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t really lose much,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were able to keep my arm and mobilities, things like that, weight, exercises. Arm still feels good and strong and I\u2019m coming out to play catch, just making sure we\u2019re not doing too much.\u201d\nTrying to keep him from throwing 100 mph too quickly will be a difficult task for manager Alex Cora. Eovaldi has a tendency to let it rip at full strength whenever he throws.\n\u201cPhysically, he is who he is,\u201d Cora said. \u201cHe went through this process last year. The only difference, he was coming off (Tommy John) surgery, too. So, they had to take care of him in that aspect. Now, it\u2019s just the bone chips, so I think compared to last year, he\u2019ll be back sooner than the previous year.\u201d\nIt took Eovaldi two months until he was back on the field post-surgery in 2018.\nPEDROIA BACK ON THE FIELD\nThe process is speeding up for Dustin Pedroia.\nHe began a rehab assignment with Triple-A Pawtucket on Friday, just five days after stopping his rehab with Double-A Portland due to left knee soreness.\nPedroia played six innings at second base for the PawSox and was 1-for-3. He is set to play three games in a row over this weekend.\nHe never played three in a row during his previous rehab assignment, and played three in a row at the big league level just once this year.\nBrock Holt will also continue rehabbing in Pawtucket. Holt, who has fully recovered from the scratched cornea in his right eye, served as the designated hitter Friday but will begin to play the field soon.\n\u201cWhen he starts playing positions we\u2019ll talk about decisions and all that stuff,\u201d Cora said.\nWith so many injuries in the infield, the Sox have chosen to play with a short bench, going with just three extra position players while they\u2019ve carried 13 pitchers.\n\u201cWe still hit for the people we feel have to hit late in games, matchup-wise,\u201d Cora said. \u201cSometimes Mitch Moreland gets to first, you think about pinch-running but you have to wait for him to get to second. If we\u2019re not going to steal here, ground ball double play and we lose Mitch. So that\u2019s the only thing. Besides that, it\u2019s been comfortable on the other end with the bullpen.\u201d\nCORA CHEERS ON BRUINS\nThe Bruins making the Stanley Cup finals excited the Red Sox manager.\n\u201cI work in probably the greatest sports city in the states right now,\u201d Cora said. \u201cI mean, this is fun. I\u2019m not a hockey fan but I work here and I got caught up watching hockey yesterday.\n\u201cHopefully it happens. Having three trophies in the same city at the same time? Wow, that\u2019s cool\u2026Amazing run. And you see the vibe of the city. They love their teams here. They love it.\u201d\nODDS AND ENDS\nDavid Price (elbow tendinitis) will likely return from the injured list to start Monday against the Blue Jays, Cora said.\nCatcher Sandy Leon was placed on the paternity list before Friday\u2019s game and catcher Oscar Hernandez was added to the active roster from Pawtucket. Right-hander Chandler Shepherd was designated for assignment to make room on the roster.\nStruggling outfielder Jackie Bradley Jr. got a night off against right-hander Gerrit Cole because Cole is so tough on lefties. Bradley is \u201cworking on a few things, too,\u201d Cora said. He\u2019ll play Saturday and Sunday.\nFriday marked the start of 33 games in 33 days for the Red Sox. They were 3-4 against the Astros in the regular season last year before ending Houston\u2019s season in five games in the American League Championship Series.\nSince the start of May, the Astros rank first in the majors and the Red Sox second in runs per game."

            "LOS ANGELES, CA - MARCH 22: The Michigan Wolverines bench celebrates in the games final minutes against the Texas A&M Aggies in the 2018 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament West Regional at Staples Center on March 22, 2018 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)\nMichigan men's basketball is looking for a new head coach after John Beilein stepped down today to take the same job with the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers. It will be tough to replace Beilein, who did a masterful job in 12 seasons with the Maize and Blue.\nMichigan was in a lengthy NCAA Tournament drought before Boeheim took over in 2007, and he snapped it in his second season. Overall, the Wolverines made nine NCAA Tournaments under Beilein, reaching the national championship game twice. He also won two Big Ten regular season titles and two Big Ten Tournament titles.\nWithout question, Michigan AD Warde Manuel will be under pressure to make a big hire. Stadium college basketball insider Jeff Goodman thinks he will do just that.\nThis afternoon, Goodman laid out his predictions for the Michigan coaching search. While he said he'd personally hire Northwestern's Chris Collins for the job, Goodman thinks the Wolverines will ultimately land former Florida head coach and current Oklahoma City Thunder boss Billy Donovan.\nDonovan has been the head coach of the Thunder since 2015, but he's under scrutiny after three-straight first-round exits. Goodman explained why he thinks the two-time NCAA Champion makes sense in Ann Arbor.\nDonovan is still the coach at OKC, but his future is in doubt \u2014 now, and certainly a year from now, if the Thunder don\u2019t make some noise in the postseason. I\u2019m gonna roll the dice here. If Donovan loses his job, this is an ideal one for him to take in college. It\u2019s also a brand where he doesn\u2019t have to deal with recruiting in the SEC again.\nWould Donovan be willing to leave the NBA before it leaves him and return to college? It is absolutely worth Michigan's time to find out.\nAfter all, this is a guy who led Florida to four Final Fours, two national titles and a national runner-up finish during his time there."

            "Carlos Gomez\u2019s second stint with the Mets will begin Friday.\nThe veteran outfielder was informed following Thursday\u2019s game for Triple-A Syracuse that the Mets were selecting his contract. It was unclear whether Gomez will be replacing Michael Conforto, who is headed to the seven-day injured list with a concussion, or if the team has decided to designate for assignment the struggling Keon Broxton. The Mets will have to give up another roster spot when Steven Matz is removed from the IL to pitch on Saturday.\nGomez came up in the Mets organization and was dealt to the Twins following the 2007 season as part of the trade for Johan Santana. The Mets nearly reacquired Gomez at the trade deadline in 2015 for Wilmer Flores and Zack Wheeler, but then-general manager Sandy Alderson killed the deal, citing Gomez\u2019s medicals. The Mets instead traded for Yoenis Cespedes and rolled to the NL pennant.\nGomez, who returned to the Mets during spring training on a minor league deal, was hitting .270 with six homers for Syracuse. Five of those homers came in his past 10 games."

            "In accordance with teasers that went live over the last several days, the OnePlus 7 Pro has just been made available to T-Mobile customers, immediately after its launch event in New York City wrapped up.\nNaturally, there\u2019s a catch, or better said \u2013 a long series of them.\nThe speed you need (but not the variety)\nAdvertisement\nAs was the case with last year\u2019s OnePlus 6T, the first handset from the Chinese brand picked up by T-Mobile (or any other American carrier), the OnePlus 7 line lacks diversity if you\u2019re only looking at what\u2019s available for purchase from the self-proclaimed Un-carrier. The middle of the three configurations is the only one being sold by the wireless juggernaut, which is unsurprising seeing how the $699 configuration using 8GB of RAM and 128GB of flash storage space is already expected to be the most popular choice from the series.\nAt least that\u2019s UFS 3.0 memory we\u2019re talking about seeing how the industry took its sweet time transitioning to the newer and faster (and more expensive) storage specification. Another positive thing of note is that T-Mobile will be offering the \u201cmid-range\u201d OnePlus 7 Pro variant in both Nebula Blue and Mirror Grey, with the latter also being the official spelling of the model\u2019s name in the U.S. The Android phablet is set to be offered for as little as $29.17 per month, with no upfront payment being required.\nUnsurprisingly, T-Mobile is limiting that offer to \u201cwell-qualified\u201d customers, i.e. those who aren\u2019t in any outstanding debt with the carrier or any one of its subsidiaries. The quoted price also assumes you agree to a two-year contract, a standard practice when it comes to mainstream devices in the country.\nAdvertisement\nWhether OnePlus is now a mainstream brand is a different debate altogether, though the company certainly seems to think so; after all, it made a pretty significant gamble by dropping its annual $30 price hikes in favor of a device that\u2019s nearly $100 more expensive than its direct predecessor. Sure, the regular OnePlus 7 was also announced but it\u2019s not happening in North America. It\u2019s also priced identically to the OnePlus 6T \u2013 \u20ac550. As for American consumers who still value the value factor, the OnePlus 6T won\u2019t be discontinued just yet, whereas that\u2019s precisely what\u2019s happening with the device in European and Asian markets set to receive the OnePlus 7 in the coming days.\nNever settle (for online orders)\nAnother unsurprising twist limiting the availability of the OnePlus 7 Pro to T-Mobile customers has to do with the fact that the said demographic can currently only get their hands on that single configuration at the T-Mobile Times Square Signature Store, as well as launch event locations in San Francisco, Miami, Chicago, Las Vegas, and Sancta Monica. Everyone else will have to wait until 6 AM ET on Friday, May 17.\nAdvertisement\nFinally, T-Mobile confirmed the new Android phablet has been optimized to fully leverage the current capabilities of its 600MHz network but don\u2019t expect the telecom giant to eventually pick up the 5G version of the device; that particular model is extremely unlikely to be released in the U.S.\nIn case you\u2019re looking for more choice than what T-Mobile is offering from what appears to be one of the most complete high-end smartphone ranges ever, your only remaining option is the OnePlus webshop."

            "COLUMBUS, OHIO - MARCH 22: Head coach Rick Barnes of the Tennessee Volunteers looks on during the second half against the Colgate Raiders in the first round of the 2019 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament at Nationwide Arena on March 22, 2019 in Columbus, Ohio. (Photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images)\nAs Tennessee basketball looks to replace lost talent, Penny Hardaway got the top recruiting class. That puts pressure on Rick Barnes and the Volunteers.\nThere\u2019s no debate anymore. With the Memphis Tigers securing a commitment from five-star Precious Achiuwa, they have the No. 1 ranked recruiting class across all services. Meanwhile, Tennessee basketball is trying to replace its four most important players from last year.\nBack in December, when the Vols beat the Tigers at the FedEx Forum, Penny Hardaway went out of his way to restore the intensity of the rivalry. He continually took shots at Rick Barnes and UT throughout the year, even as Rocky Top was spending weeks on top of the polls while his team missed out on the NCAA Tournament.\nBut Tennessee basketball was eliminated from the NCAA Tournament in the Sweet 16. Then, knowing that Admiral Schofield and Kyle Alexander would leave, they began to realize that Grant Williams and Jordan Bone would also leave early for the NBA.\nMeanwhile, Hardaway went from being a coach who could only secure local kids and players he had connections with to getting kids from all over the country. His class now includes two five-stars, including the best player in the country, and five four-stars. And it comes one year into the rivalry being restored.\nYour move Rick Barnes. Seriously. The next two games between the schools are in Knoxville in Nashville. Given all the talk Hardaway levied against UT this past season, it would be embarrassing for them to fall behind the Tigers in terms of the state of the programs and even lose to them outside of Memphis when they own the rest of the state.\nAnd they already are falling behind in recruiting. Right now, the Vols have a class that includes two three-stars, a player who is sometimes a three-star and sometimes a four-star depending on the service you use, and one five-star in Josiah James who can be a four-star on some services. The class overall is a top 30 class. But it\u2019s not No. 1.\nAdd in the fact that the Vols lost so much talent, and it\u2019s easy to see the Tigers having a leg up on them. Now, it\u2019s true, Hardaway still has to coach these recruits. And even when the rivalry between the Vols and Tigers was at its peak, when Bruce Pearl and John Calipari were there, Calipari focused more on one and done elite talent while Pearl developed really good players.\nBut while Calipari is doing that on a higher level the Kentucky Wildcats now and the Vols have reinvigorated that basketball rivalry, Hardaway just beat him out for that top class. And his class this year is better than any class Calipari ever secured for the Tigers.\nThere is some good news, however. Barnes is still going the graduate transfer route for some players, and there is still talent on the Vols at this moment. Their new recruits, particularly James, should help with that.\nAlso, as we said, Tennessee basketball has always been a program more about developing talent. Hardaway may be able to develop the talent, but at this stage in their careers, Barnes is clearly more proven at doing that.\nFinally the only comparable class to this one ever secured at Memphis was 2010 under Josh Pastner. That was the No. 2 ranked class overall, and it turned out to be a total bust. Well, part of that was because he is a total bust as a head coach.\nStill, it\u2019s unfair to compare Pastner to Hardaway. After all, Pastner canceled the UT-Memphis rivalry because he thought it hurt the Tigers in recruiting. Hardaway just proved it didn\u2019t. And Hardaway does have some track record of developing talent since he spent years coaching at the high school level. Pastner has been a head coach for 10 years and still has none.\nSimply put, there are lots of unanswered questions about what will happen between Tennessee basketball and Memphis. But for them to assure themselves the top class across all services with a major pickup the same day Grant Williams announced he\u2019s staying in the NBA Draft is a big deal. And the Vols need to hope they can respond next year."

            "Eurovision\u2019s 2019 finals are due to kick off in Israel on Saturday night, the climax to a heated run-up that as well as musical performances has included pro-Palestinian boycott calls and raised fears a war with Gaza might scupper the entire event.\nAn estimated 200 million viewers worldwide are expected to tune in as 26 finalists compete to win the longest-running TV music competition.\nThe Netherlands\u2019 pop piano ballad was the bookies\u2019 firm favourite to win, leading a lineup that includes an Australian operatic act sung from atop a swaying two-storey pole and a shouting-meets-synth Icelandic bondage-style group.\nIsrael had hoped the extravaganza would promote the country as a trendy escape for European tourists on the Mediterranean coast. But Eurovision was unable to live up to its apolitical aspirations this year, with deep domestic and international divisions causing significant contention from day one.\nPoliticians in Israel tried and failed to convince the event\u2019s organisers, the European Broadcasting Union, to allow them to host in Jerusalem as a symbolic move intended to boost their disputed claim to the holy city, part of which is contested by the Palestinians.\nConcerns over the event peaked earlier this month when Israel and militants in Gaza fought one of deadliest clashes in years, killing 23 Palestinians and four Israelis and sparking the rumblings of war. An unofficial truce ended three days of bloodshed and appeared to have held.\nMeanwhile, rights campaigners accuse Israel of exploiting the frivolous pizzazz to distract from its treatment of Palestinians, millions of whom live just an hour\u2019s drive from Tel Aviv under military rule in the West Bank or blockaded in Gaza to the south.\nThe global boycott, divestment and sanctions movement \u2013 which calls for an end to the occupation, to stop discrimination against Arabs in Israel, and to allow Palestinian refugees and their families to return \u2013 has also pressurised singers to pull out. None have agreed, and Madonna, who is headlining the opening of the show, said she would \u201cnever stop playing music to suit someone\u2019s political agenda\u201d.\nOf all the acts, Iceland\u2019s Hatari has been the most outspoken, accusing the Israeli government of running a policy of \u201capartheid\u201d.\nOrganisers are worried that the finals might be hijacked by a protest in front of a global audience, and Israel said it would use legal means to block activists who wanted to \u201cdisturb\u201d the event from entering the country.\nIn Israel, Eurovision has angered some observant Jewish communities who accuse its organisers of desecrating the sabbath, the holy day of rest when work is forbidden, by running rehearsals and allowing public transport to operate on Saturday before sundown."

            "Nurse hints at lineup changes for Game 3 With the Raptors in an 0-2 hole, head coach Nick Nurse hinted at possible lineup changes for Game 3 as the series shifts back to Toronto. TSN's Josh Lewenberg has more.\nJosh Lewenberg TSN Raptors Reporter Follow| Archive\nTORONTO \u2013 With his team trailing the Milwaukee Bucks 2-0 in the Eastern Conference Finals, Toronto Raptors head coach Nick Nurse is contemplating making multiple lineup changes ahead of Sunday\u2019s crucial Game 3.\n\u201cI think there could be more than one lineup change coming at us,\u201d he said on a conference call Saturday afternoon before hedging a bit. \u201cI think your question here is this: Are you gonna dance with the one you brought to the ball? It's not easy.\u201d\n\u201cI kinda trust these guys, know who they are, believe in them, and know they're better than they played [Friday] night and have shown that on bounce-back situations usually.\u201d\nAfter a fourth-quarter collapse cost them a game they felt they could have, and arguably should have won in Wednesday\u2019s series opener, the Raptors were demolished in Game 2, falling 125-103 in Milwaukee on Friday.\nWhile he certainly wasn\u2019t the only Raptors player to underperform, Marc Gasol\u2019s slow start helped fuel the Bucks\u2019 early run. The veteran centre missed his first four shots, getting blocked on two of them, and committed a couple bad turnovers as Milwaukee scored the first nine points of the night and went on to win wire-to-wire.\n\u201cI played really bad and that set the tone,\u201d Gasol admitted afterwards. \u201cThe beginning put us in a real bad spot and we couldn\u2019t get a grip of the game early on, and I take full responsibility for that.\u201d\nAsked specifically if he would consider swapping his two centres and start Serge Ibaka in Game 3, Nurse was non-committal, though he wouldn\u2019t rule it out.\nGasol has had a rough start to this series. Through two games, he\u2019s shooting an abysmal 3-for-20 from the field. Defensively, he struggled to contain Brook Lopez in the opener \u2013 the Bucks centre went off for 29 points and 11 rebounds \u2013 and he didn\u2019t provide much resistance at the rim in Game 2.\nMeanwhile, the more mobile Ibaka would seem to matchup better against this fast-paced, sharpshooting Milwaukee team. He\u2019s had success against the Bucks in the past, averaging 22.3 points in four regular season meetings and 14.8 points over his 10-year career \u2013 more than he\u2019s scored against any other team. He\u2019s also been an X-factor for the Raptors this postseason \u2013 they\u2019re 6-0 when he scores in double figures and 2-6 when he doesn\u2019t.\nEven with all that in mind, it\u2019s hard to fault Nurse for sticking with Gasol early in this series. Despite his modest numbers (7.9 points, 5.9 rebounds and 2.9 assists on 40 per cent shooting), Gasol has had a strong postseason. Like his teammate Kyle Lowry, Gasol\u2019s impact doesn\u2019t always show up on the box score. Without his defence, neutralizing a couple of all-star centres in Nikola Vucevic and Joel Embiid, the Raptors may not have made it to the Conference Finals.\nIt\u2019s a tougher decision than some may realize, but it\u2019s one Nurse has spent all season preparing to make.\nAfter being eliminated by LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in each of the last three seasons, twice in second-round sweeps, the Raptors have had to look back in order to move forward.\nWhat did they do wrong? What should they have done differently? What can they do to ensure that it doesn\u2019t happen again? These are the questions that team president Masai Ujiri has pondered and Nurse \u2013 the former assistant who was hired to replace his old boss \u2013 has been tasked with trying to answer.\nThis is a new year and a different team, but there are lessons to be taken from past failures. One of the first that Nurse spoke about publicly after being promoted in June was the way in which the team had managed its rotation in preparation for the playoffs.\nVery early in the 2017-18 season, Dwane Casey settled on a rigid 10-man rotation, which featured two units that played a lot of minutes together, and why not? The starters were really good and their young second unit, which became known as the \u201cBench Mob\u201d, was the very best in the NBA.\nHowever, when they ran into the Cavs \u2013 a team that played small and shot a ton of threes \u2013 in the playoffs their rotation was exposed and they were forced to adjust on the fly.\nThat series started with a missed opportunity in Game 1 and an embarrassing blowout loss in Game 2. Sound familiar?\nIn Game 3, Casey made a lineup change \u2013 starting Fred VanVleet in place of the struggling Ibaka \u2013 but was it the right one? Jonas Valanciunas was still matched up with Kevin Love, who had been playing centre for Cleveland. It wasn\u2019t until the Raptors were on the brink of elimination in Game 4 that they finally brought JV off the bench and started Ibaka at the five.\nAt that point, it didn\u2019t seem to matter what rotation tweaks they made. The problem was they weren\u2019t prepared to improvise. If it looked like some guys had never played together before, it\u2019s probably because they hadn\u2019t.\nSo, from the moment Nurse got the job his mantra has been experimentation. The Raptors used 22 different starting lineups during the regular season \u2013 10 more than they used the year before \u2013 in part because injuries and Kawhi Leonard\u2019s frequent rest nights forced their hand, but mostly because Nurse felt it was important to tinker and remain flexible. He wanted each of his players to feel comfortable on the floor at all times, regardless of who they were out there with.\nThat was the thinking behind the platoon that saw Ibaka share the starting centre gig with Valanciunas and then with Gasol following the mid-season trade with Memphis.\nAfter starting 550 straight regular season games, Ibaka came off the bench 23 times this year, including 10 of his final 11 contests as Gasol transitioned into the starting role on a more permanent basis.\nAll of the lineup shuffling was a calculated risk on Nurse\u2019s part. It meant that chemistry would be harder to build and maintain between the units and players might find it difficult to stay in rhythm without more defined roles. Perhaps we\u2019re seeing the by-product of that now, as several of those players have struggled in the playoffs, particularly the reserves.\nNow we could find out if it was worth it.\nIbaka has played 583 minutes with the other four starters (regular season and playoffs) and so the transition back to his former role should be seamless. Gasol has also logged plenty of time with VanVleet and the rest of the subs, so a move to the bench wouldn\u2019t be that much of an adjustment, if Nurse decides to go that route.\nIn terms of other lineup changes, he may also be considering swapping the slumping Danny Green for Norman Powell, who had 14 points off the bench in Game 3 and played a pivotal role in Toronto\u2019s first-round series win over Milwaukee in 2017.\nAs bleak as things may seem coming off Friday\u2019s loss, this series is not over. The Bucks did what they were supposed to do as the favoured team and took care of their home court. Now the Raptors have to do the same. A win in Game 3 gives them new life but a loss would mean certain death, that\u2019s how small the margin for error is at this stage.\nOnly seven per cent of teams that fall behind 2-0 in a best-of-seven have ever come back to win the series (20 of 302). No team has ever dug themselves out of a 3-0 hole.\nWith the season on the line it will be interesting to see which buttons Nurse pushes and whether the ones he\u2019s already pushed pay dividends.\u200b"

            "After 50 years, and claiming credit for almost 1,000 unions, the Knock Marriage Bureau has announced that it has played Cupid for the last time.\nThe service, more recently known as Knock Marriage Introductions, was set up in 1968 with the aim of introducing couples to each other, many of whom went on to become husband and wife. It claims to have been responsible for 960 marriages over the course of its existence.\nFr Stephen Farragher, who is director of Knock Marriage Introductions and a priest in the Tuam archdiocese, said there has been a \"noticeable decline in the demand for the service offered by Knock Marriage Introductions, to the point that it is no longer viable to run the service\".\nFr Farragher told The Irish Times that the running costs of the service were between \u20ac40,000 and \u20ac50,000 per year, but it was only generating a fraction of that in income from annual subscribers, who paid \u20ac200 per year. He also said there were increasing bureaucratic hurdles to be cleared that didn\u2019t exist when the service was established.\nREAD MORE\n\u201cYou\u2019re into the whole area of data and regulation, we were also advised that we would have a duty of care, if we introduced someone who was abusive, to what extent would we have to cover them.\u201d\nThe bureau was established by Fr Michael Keane to \"attract young women to the west of Ireland from America, England and Dublin and introduce them to the bachelors in five Connacht counties where men outnumber women by two to one\", according to press reports at the time of its launch.\nDivorced or separated people were not allowed to use the service, although Fr Keane, who died in 2011 aged 86, felt this should be changed. It was not the only time he clashed with Catholic Church hierarchy, picketing a meeting of church leaders in 1986 demanding a greater say for the laity. He also wrote letters criticising aspects of church teaching on abortion, and supported the ordination of women and allowing priests to marry.\nHusband and wife\nFr Farragher said the decision to close the service was done \u201cwith heavy hearts, but happy in the knowledge that at least for 960 couples, it played a part in helping them to become husband and wife.\u201d\nIn 2000, the bureau was already feeling the pinch from online competitors, with Fr Keane telling The Irish Times dating agencies were \u201cexploiting\u201d young couples with charges of up to \u00a31,000, compared to the Knock fee of \u00a360 for an introduction.\nThe following year, he said that numbers using the service were increasing despite competition. \u201cWe\u2019re not on the internet but the bureau may have its own website later in the year with the help of two computer programmers whom we recently introduced to one another,\u201d said Fr Keane."

            "Kyle Korver took to the podium at his alma mater, Creighton University in Omaha, on Saturday to deliver a commencement speech on identity and privilege, familiar themes of late for the NBA veteran with Iowa roots.\nIn April, Korver published an essay in the Player's Tribune, a publication dedicated to disseminating the views of professional athletes, where he took stock of his career as a white athlete in a league largely populated by black players.\nDuring what the 16-year veteran described as only his second attempt at public speaking ever \u2014 the first occurred during a freshman speech class at Creighton for which he received a failing grade \u2014 Korver spoke earnestly about interrogating your own identity as a way towards understanding your personal responsibilities in a complex world.\nThe speech draws references from sources as disparate as second-century holy figure Saint Irenaeus (\"The glory of God is man (or woman) fully alive\"), historian Howard Zinn (\"You can't be neutral on a moving train\") and basketball legend/Korver mentor Allen Iverson (\"Shooters shoot the ball\").\nThe speech, though serious in its message, is built upon self-effacing attitudes and anecdotes, which make Korver appear bashful and charming, boyish even at 38 years old.\nEarly in the speech, he fakes the audience out by giving them his personal walk-through of how to shoot a basketball. He also made reference to an oft-cited story used to illustrate how impressive his NBA career has been: When Korver was initially drafted by the then-New Jersey Nets with the 51st pick in 2003, he was essentially sold to the Philadelphia 76ers for enough cash to cover Summer League fees and to pick up a new fax machine.\n\"What's your trade value?\" he said, smiling at the podium. \"Mine was apparently a copy machine! It's OK. A few years back, that copy machine broke \u2014 and I'm still playing.\"\nZinn's quote about the impossibility of remaining neutral on a moving train allowed Korver to segway into revisiting the thesis of his Player's Tribune essay and personal responsibility white people like him have when it comes to systemic racism.\n\"As a white man, I could opt into the conversation about racism and inequality \u2014 but I could just as easily opt out. I've almost always opted out,\" he said. \"For people of color in America \u2014 and yes, even many NBA players \u2014 systemic injustices aren't something they get to opt in or opt out of. They're an everyday reality.\"\nKorver asked the Creighton University Class of 2019 to, above all, be \"someone who cares.\"\n\"Working hard is good! And money in itself is not bad. I'm not saying don't buy that car or go on that vacation. Go live it up,\" he said near the conclusion of his speech. \"Comfort and fun are parts of life \u2014 but we should be uncomfortable with the kind of comfort that comes at the expense of others.\"\nFor Korver, it's clear that a sense of self and the responsibility that comes with one's place in the world are part of an ongoing, lifelong journey.\nYou can read the speech in its entirety here or watch it below.\nFollow the Register on Facebook and Twitter for more news.

            "The latest round of AMD X570 chipset powered motherboards has leaked out by Videocardz and this time we are looking at the MSI lineup for Ryzen 3000 series processors. With Computex just a few days away, more leaks and teasers for the next-gen X570 boards have started appearing on the web.\nMSI X570 Motherboards Pictured, The X570 Gaming Pro Carbon and The X570 Gaming Plus For AMD Ryzen 3000 CPUs\nThere are at least two motherboards which are revealed by Videocardz and both utilize the AMD X570 chipset. There would obviously be more motherboards in the new AM4 lineup for 3rd Gen Ryzen processors but right now, let's talk about the two pictured today.\nMSI X570 Gaming Pro Carbon Motherboard\nStarting off with the higher-end MSI X570 Gaming Pro Carbon, we are looking at what seems to be a 12 phase VRM which should deliver some really good overclocking results on the upcoming AMD Ryzen processors. The AM4 socket is powered by an 8+4 pin connector configuration and there are the MSI DDR4 Boost and Core Boost technologies that should automatically tune up clocks from within the BIOS. There are four DDR4 DIMM slots that can support up to 64 GB of DDR4 memory. Supported clock speeds aren't mentioned but we have seen up to 4000 MHz OC+ memory support on BIOSTAR's X570 Racing GT8 motherboard so we should expect higher memory clock support on the Gaming Carbon.\nStorage options include 6 SATA III ports and dual USB 3.0 front panel headers. Expansion includes two PCI-e 4.0 x16 slots (x16/x8 electrical), two PCI-e 4.0 x1 slots and two M.2 slots (PCI-e 4.0 x4). The full-length PCI-e slots are shielded by metal brace while the M.2 slots are covered by heatsinks that extend from the main PCH heatsink. The motherboard has wireless (WiFi+BT) capability which has been indicated by the source.\nMSI has there Dragon theme and carbon textures all across the motherboard and we can also see active fan cooling on the PCH which is a common theme for all X570 motherboards we have seen so far. The MSI X570 Gaming Carbon seems to have solid I/O and a metal fin heatsinks along the CPU VRMs and a great looking I/O panel cover with RGBs that are compliant with MSI's Mystic Aura lighting technology.\nMSI X570 Gaming Plus Motherboard\nMoving on to the MSI X570 Gaming Plus, we are looking at a slightly toned down design with standard aluminum heatsinks that are placed over what looks to be a 6 or 8 phase VRM supply. Power to the socket is supplied through an 8+4 pin connector configuration and we can spot the whole red and black aesthetics across the motherboard. Storage options include 6 SATA III ports while expansion slots include two PCI-e 4.0 x16 (x16/x8 electrical), three PCI-e 4.0 x1 and two M.2 slots. The motherboard also features the active fan cooling on the PCH heatsink which looks to be of the same design as MSI's AERO series graphics cards.\nThe MSI Gaming Plus (X470) was priced under $140 US so we can see that even the entry-level X570 boards require active PCH cooling which could highlight slightly higher thermals than the existing X470 and X370 PCH.\nAMD's Next-Gen X570 Chipset \u2013 A New House For Ryzen 3000 Series CPUs\nAs we saw with X470, there were a few features for the Ryzen 2000 series processors which were only supported by new motherboards such as Precision Boost Overdrive and XFR 2.0. There\u2019s no doubt that AMD\u2019s Zen 2 based Ryzen mainstream processor family would come with new features but the main highlight would be support for PCIe Gen4. The X570 platform will be an all PCIe Gen4 solution, which means this would most probably be the first consumer platform to feature support for the new PCIe standard.\nThat, however, doesn\u2019t mean that AMD Ryzen 3000 series would only be compatible on X570 boards since just like last time, the new CPUs will be backward compatible with X470 & X370 boards too. Following are links to the respective motherboard manufacturers BIOS release for existing motherboards to support 3rd Gen AMD Ryzen CPUs:\nThey certainly won\u2019t display the same feature set that will be available on the newly launched X570 lineup but will feature fully stable functionality for users who just want to drop in a new CPU and continue using their PCs without the hassle of upgrading the motherboard and everything from scratch. Expect more to hear at Computex 2019 which commences on 27th May 2019."

            "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\nFrom its powerful far right-baiting opening image of a football-mad French kid of Arabic heritage draped in the country\u2019s iconic flag to an unsettling and mayhem-filled finale, Ladj Ly\u2019s gripping play on Victor Hugo\u2019s humanist masterwork, Les Mis\u00e9rables, is uncompromising, angry-as-hell political cinema.\nSet over the course of two days during last year\u2019s World Cup, France once again on the cusp of soccer immortality, the streets of Paris bounce with long-cherished ideals of the Republic: Liberty, Fraternity, and Egalitarianism. Boulevards have transformed into seas of bodies gathered together in hope and high expectation of repeat success. Everybody is singing, dancing, cheering. There is talk of Kylian Mbappe winning the Golden Shoe.\nYet the elixir of footie, as in 1998, when France first lifted the World Cup trophy, was only a ceasefire in the culture wars, a beautiful dream soon vanish, a momentary pause, false dawn. For the nation\u2019s deep-seated issues over race and multiculturalism were allowed to fester and governments continued to treat the underclass as a problem best forgotten. The opening scenes, occurring as they do 20 years on from the initial victory, are as ironic as they are tragic. For what has changed? Nothing.\nLes Mis\u00e9rables\u2019 set-up is a bit like Antoine Fuqua\u2019s 2001 Oscar-winner Training Day. A cop, here relocated from the sticks, is assigned to a jaded unit working the rougher parts of the capital and has his eyes opened to how a badge and status imbues loose cannons with a fascistic sense of entitlement and power over the lives of others. Things escalate quickly enough and the unit\u2019s brazen, self-defeating approach to policing is akin to throwing petrol on a roaring fire.\nAlthough the handling of certain plot dynamics on occasion isn\u2019t as strong as its potent aesthetic finesse, Ly mounts a thriller operating as a savage indictment of social policies and underhand police tactics and ass-covering corruption. Those sworn to serve and protect are allowed free rein to unnerve and harass. Paid to be our public servants, they swan about as our masters. \u201cI do what I want,\u201d the white leader of the unit tells a fifteen-year-old French-Arab girl he\u2019s menaced in broad daylight.\nRiveting, pitched somewhere between The Battle of Algiers and Do the Right Thing, Ly\u2019s immersive use of slum locations, compelling scenario (it\u2019s based on a real-life incident) and brooding atmosphere make for an impressive debut film and vital reminder how lack of social justice generates unending and unnecessary misery. Coming as it does in the days of the Yellow Vests protests and President Macron\u2019s tin-eared blundering while in office, Les Mis\u00e9rables is bound to cause a stir.\nThe 72nd Cannes Film Festival takes place from 14-25 May.\nMartyn Conterio | @Cinemartyn"

            "If you weren't already excited for Ali Wong and Randall Park's new Netflix rom-com Always Be My Maybe, this first trailer should do the trick.\nIn the film, the two play Sasha and Marcus, a pair of childhood friends who once hooked up and drifted apart. She's since become a famous celebrity chef, while he ... well, he moonlights as an aspiring musician but puts food on the table by working as a mover. The two reconnect when he shows up to her doorstep to deliver her things to a new locale, and they begin to rekindle their friendship just as she's grappling with being dumped by her fiance (Daniel Dae Kim).\nMarcus hasn't changed as much as she has over the years, and it looks like he'd love to pick up where they last left off in the back of his tiny car, but there's one big problem: she's got a swoony new boyfriend (Keanu Reeves) whose mind-blowing bedroom techniques she can't stop talking about.\nWong and Park co-wrote this film alongside Michael Golamco, with Nahnatchka Khan directing. And if all this didn't get you excited enough, the film also stars Michelle Buteau, Vivian Bang, Karan Soni, Charlyne Yi, James Saito, Lyrics Born, and Susan Park.\nAlways Be My Maybe arrives on Netflix on Friday, May 31."

            "Danny Roberts is looking to get back to his winning ways following a controversial hometown loss to Claudio Silva at UFC London when he takes on viral sensation and promotional newcomer, Michel Pereira, at UFC Rochester.\nRoberts was deemed to have verbally submitted to Silva as he attempted to negotiate his way out of an armbar, handing the victory to the Brazilian. Casting his mind back to the event, Roberts remarked that he had no idea that a verbal submission rule was in place and insisted that the referee did not mention anything about it prior to the contest.\n\u201cI only found out after the fight [about the verbal submission rule],\u201d Roberts told MMA Fighting.\n\u201cI was going back and forth with people on social media, I was hearing all different kinds of things from all different kinds of places. Even then, there were plenty of people debating if it was a rule or if it wasn\u2019t a rule. At the rules meeting before the fight, it wasn\u2019t something I was made aware of by the referee.\u201d\nUp until the Silva loss, Roberts had been in sensational form, seeing off Oliver Enkamp with a first round knockout before claiming a decision win over Polish stalwart, David Zawada. He insists the loss to Silva has brought no pause to his momentum.\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t slowed me down whatsoever. It was just a hard thing to digest at the time, but there was also a lot to take away from it. We got some time in against a slippery customer who competes on the world stage in jiu-jitsu, who hasn\u2019t been beat in 11 years. I felt like I was beating him for two rounds and then a mistake in the heat of the moment cost me the fight,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBetween the UFC and the fans, they know who I am; they know what I bring to the table. I come to fight and I always bring it. I really believe that I\u2019m up there with some of the best in the world and it\u2019s only a matter of time before an opportunity pops up for me to prove that.\u201d\nPereira has become one of the most viral entities outside of the major promotions due to his recent flashy performances with Road FC. Given the Brazilian\u2019s fighting style, Roberts believes he can dominate the proceedings.\n\u201cWith this kid that I\u2019m fighting, he likes to do flashy things, he\u2019s a bit of showman and I think that will make for an exciting matchup,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI\u2019m a guy that takes the fight game very seriously and I\u2019m going to have a guy across from me that\u2019s going to try and show a lot of flair and diversity in his striking. Honestly, I think it\u2019s going to be one-sided, I think I\u2019m going to shut him down quick.\u201d\nAfter studying tape on his opponent, \u201cHot Chocolate\u201d is confident that he can avoid ending up on the end of a spectacular knockout, which has become Pereira\u2019s calling card.\n\u201cThe guy has had 11 fights in the last two years, so there is plenty of tape on him and we\u2019ve seen a lot of patterns and setups from him that are exactly the same,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cSaying that, a fight is a fight, when you get in there and the lights are on a lot of things can change, but we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ve seen a lot of repetition in this guy throughout his last few fights.\u201d\nRoberts believes Pereira\u2019s need to play to the crowd will be his undoing. He also underlined his belief that the Brazilian is taking a big step up in terms of opposition.\n\u201cThis is the UFC; he\u2019s in the big leagues now. This is the one percent and I truly feel I\u2019m part of the one percent; I feel like I was born to be in the one percent. He needs to come out and prove that he belongs here, because I already know this is where I\u2019m supposed to be. I don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s any pressure on me whatsoever, he\u2019s the one that\u2019s got to do something, not me,\u201d Roberts said.\n\u201cLooking at him, who he is and what he does, there will be a lot of eyes on this fight. I don\u2019t expect that to change, I think his fighting style is part of the reason he\u2019s got to where he is. People are going to expect that flair and showmanship, but I\u2019ll be walking forward, ready for a war.\u201d\nPushed for prediction, Roberts forecast that the fight wouldn\u2019t make it to the third round.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see it going passed the second round,\u201d stated Roberts. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to hit the floor too much, and again, I really can\u2019t see this one going the full 15 minutes.\u201d\nDanny Roberts is an ambassador of leading mouthguard provider, OPRO.

            "Mercedes-Benz is launching its new EQC electric SUV and they invited us to Norway to test drive it for the first time.\nHere are my impressions of the German automaker\u2019s first next-gen electric vehicle.\nMercedes-Benz EQC Specs\nWhile Mercedes-Benz did have other all-electric vehicles in the past, like the B-Class Electric, the EQC is in many ways the first true all-electric Mercedes-Benz vehicle.\nIt\u2019s not a converted gasoline car to make a compliance vehicle. It\u2019s a real effort from Mercedes to build an electric car from the ground up.\nThough to be fair, it\u2019s built on the same production line has the GLC SUV and it shares some of its parts.\nThey developed a skateboard-like platform with the battery in the middle and dual motor, one on each axle, which has become the standard in the industry.\nThe battery pack is where things get interesting. Mercedes-Benz is listing it as having a capacity of 80 kWh, but that\u2019s the usable energy capacity.\nMost automakers are listing the energy capacity of the battery pack as the full potential capacity, but not Mercedes-Benz.\nThey didn\u2019t even want to give us the full energy capacity.\nBased on the WLTP cycle, the electric SUV has a range of 259 miles (417 km). It\u2019s the same as the Audi e-tron electric SUV, which has a 95 kWh battery pack with 83.6 kWh of usable capacity.\nThe e-tron is a slightly larger vehicle, which could explain them having the same range with slightly different usable energy capacity.\nHowever, in my own experience with the EQC, it\u2019s getting closer to 200 miles on a single charge.\nThe battery pack is powered by 2 asynchronous motors with a total capacity of 300 kW (408 hp). It can achieve a top speed of 180 km/h (111 mph) and an acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 5.1 seconds.\nAccording to the spec sheet, the EQC is equipped with a water-cooled onboard charger with a capacity of 7.4 kW and has a maximum capacity of \u201cup to 110 kW at an appropriate charging station.\u201c\nI tested out the fast-charging capacity at a 150+ kW Ionity charging station during our trip in Norway.\nI couldn\u2019t get more than 87 kW out of the vehicle, but I still arrived at the station with about 40% state-of-charge.\nPresumably, it could achieve a 110 kW charge rate if you start charging from a lower state-of-charge.\nFor the last 50%, it looks like it can take up to 40 minutes to obtain a full charge, but most people would charge from 10-20% to around 80%.\nMercedes-Benz EQC Design\nAs for the design, the form factor is very similar to the GLC. You can tell that it\u2019s a Mercedes-Benz SUV at first glance.\nIt\u2019s with the front fascia and the wheels that Mercedes-Benz was able to be a little more creative and release design features specific to the tact that the vehicle is electric.\nThey have designed several different fascias with different faux grilles that customers can choose from:\nEven electric vehicles don\u2019t require as much air intake in the front for cooling purposes, most automakers aside from Tesla have found it hard to move away from the tradtional grille design.\nIn the case of the EQC, it actually does have some small air intakes in the grille that are activated only when needed. Most of what we see is a fake grille.\nAs far as fake grilles go, I think they have some cool designs here. I especially like the first one (107).\nMercedes-Benz also designed some new wheels for the EQC:\nThey are also mostly covered in order to optimize aerodynamic performance and help increase efficiency.\nMercedes-Benz EQC Driving Impressions\nMercedes-Benz owners would find a familiar environment when getting inside the EQC.\nThe user experience is extremely similar to any modern Mercedes-Benz and you find the same premium interior that the German automaker is known for.\nFor most people, the first new experience will happen when pressing the start button and the only feedback you get is from the displays. No roar of an engine.\nThis silence is extended through the entire driving experience. The Mercedes-Benz EQC s extremely quiet even by electric vehicle standard.\nThe automaker decoupled the front motor twice from the platform to limit its noise and vibration. As forthe back motor, it\u2019s much further away from the driver, but they also put a cover on it.\nWhen combined with a well-isolated cabin and the build quality that Mercedes-Benz is known for, it resulted in an exceptionally quiet driving experience.\nThe heads-up display is going to be one of the first things drivers are going to notice.\nAs far as HUDs go, it\u2019s one of the best ones I have used. The darker projection around the information is not too distracting.\nThe speedometer and the speed limit warnings are quite useful because the EQC is extremely smooth and you don\u2019t always feel how fast you are going.\nAs for the regenerative braking, there are so many different modes, which can be selected through paddles on the steering wheel, that there\u2019s almost something for everyone.\nD Auto (recuperation via ECO Assist to suit the situation)\nD + (coasting)\nD (low recuperation)\nD \u2013 (medium recuperation)\nD \u2013 \u2013 (high recuperation) This makes one-pedal driving possible, because in most situations the recuperative deceleration is enough not to require operation of the brake pedal.\nMercedes-Benz calls the highest level \u201cone-pedal driving\u201d, but that\u2019s not exactly true. There\u2019s no option to remove creep and while you can almost come to a stop on \u2018D \u2013 -\u2018, you need to press the brake for the complete stop.\nThe automaker also offers a lot of different driving modes\nCOMFORT: Default setting; accelerator pedal characteristic supports a comfortable driving style, but also automatically becomes more dynamic depending on the driving style.\nDefault setting; accelerator pedal characteristic supports a comfortable driving style, but also automatically becomes more dynamic depending on the driving style. ECO: Driving program focused on high efficiency and low consumption.\nDriving program focused on high efficiency and low consumption. MAX RANGE: Intelligent driving program that can help the driver achieve the maximum possible range.\nIntelligent driving program that can help the driver achieve the maximum possible range. SPORT: Driving program focused on the best response for the highest driving performance.\nDriving program focused on the best response for the highest driving performance. INDIVIDUAL: There is also an individual driving program which allows the various parameters to be adjusted separately.\nI didn\u2019t have enough time with the car to set an individual driving program, but I think that could be interesting.\nMy time on Sport mode was fun with a very dynamic pedal response. Comfort, which is the default setting, is perfect for driving in traffic or on the highway.\nMax Range creates a hard pressure point in the accelerator that limits the top speed to the speed limit unless you override it through a very hard press.\nIt was frustrating to use and I couldn\u2019t handle it for more than 10 minutes. I think it should only be used as a last resort if you think you are going to be short on range.\nMercedes-Benz EQC First Thoughts\nAfter my short time with the EQC, I mostly came out impressed by Mercedes-Benz\u2019s first real entry in the all-electric vehicle space.\nIt\u2019s going to have some decent competition in the space with a few other premium all-electric SUVs coming to market around the same time.\nThe EQC is a little smaller with less cargo space than the competition, like the Audi e-tron.\nI think it will have a tough time competing, but for Mercedes-Benz fans who are looking to go electric, it will be the smoothest transition for them.\nThe electric SUV is not extremely efficient and with a limited 80 kWh usable battery capacity, its range might be short for some people even though 200+ miles of range is more than enough for the vast majority of car buyers.\nI suppose a lot will depend on the price, which hasn\u2019t been announced yet.\nIf Mercedes-Benz can keep it under $70,000 before incentives, it could still be an interesting option, but I would need to spend more time with the car.\nThe Mercedes-Benz EQC is coming to Europe starting next month and it should arrive in the US early next year.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

            "Ashok Lavasa, the election commissioner who disagreed with the poll panel\u2019s decisions to clear Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah of charges of violating the so-called Model Code of Conduct (MCC) \u2014 which regulates candidate, party and government behaviour during the elections \u2014 has, since May 4 recused himself from all meetings to discuss MCC issues.\nHe has insisted that he will do so only after dissent notes and minority decisions are included in the orders of the commission.\nAlso Read | \u20b93000 crore haul by Election Commission, highest in Lok Sabha polls\nAccording to a person familiar with the development, the commission has not held any meetings to discuss MCC violations since May 4 because of this. The poll panel\u2019s decision to clear Modi and Shah in all cases of MCC violations, made in a May 3 meeting came in for significant criticism.\nThis was followed by news reports that Lavasa had disagreed with the decisions, although this dissent wasn\u2019t registered in the orders that were passed.\nThe orders themselves came ahead of a scheduled Supreme Court hearing in a case on the EC dragging its feet over complaints regarding violations of the code of conduct by Shah and Modi filed by Congress leader Sushmita Dev.\nThe specific complaints discussed at the EC meeting regarding Modi and Shah included the PM\u2019s speech in Nanded in Maharashtra on April 6 where he referred to the majority being a minority in Wayanad (Congress President Rahul Gandhi\u2019s second constituency); and for his speech in Varanasi where he said 42 terrorists were killed to avenge the death of 40 troopers in Pulwama. Shah was let off for his remarks in an election rally in Kerala where he purportedly said that it was difficult to make out if Wayanad is in India or Pakistan.\nOpinion | Election Commission should appear to be \u2018fair\u2019\nThe person familiar with the matter said that Lavasa has sent several reminders to the Chief Election Commissioner since May 4, to include minority decisions or dissent notes in the final orders. The Election Commission has not passed any orders on violations of the model code since, although it has asked those behind alleged violations for explanations, the official added.\n\u201cThe commissioner had earlier sought to know why his dissenting note was not made part of the final orders issued by the commission,\u201d said this person.\nChief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora did not respond to text messages seeking comment.\nA former finance secretary, Lavasa differed with the decision of the two other members of the poll body, Arora and election commissioner Sushil Chandra, while deciding on the cases of model code of conduct violations against Prime Minister Modi and BJP President Shah. He suggested sending a notice to Modi, which wasn\u2019t accepted. There were at least six complaints in which the PM was given a clean chit, while Congress president Rahul Gandhi was let off in one case.\nA bunch of complaints pertaining to the violations of the model code of conduct, including one against Prime Minister Modi, for addressing former PM Rajiv Gandhi as \u201cBhrashtachari No 1\u201d is now pending with the commission.\nOn whether the commission can go ahead with the meetings in his absence, the person cited above said the rules allow for a majority decision and therefore, a decision can be taken in his absence.\nAs per the Election Commission (Conditions of Service of Election Commissioners and Transaction of Business) Act, 1991, if the chief election commissioner and other election commissioners differ in opinion on any matter, such matters are decided according to the opinion of the majority. The commission transacts its business by holding regular meetings and also by circulation of papers. All election commissioners have equal say in the decision making of the commission.\nHT reported on May 6 that the EC had justified not including the dissenting opinion on the grounds that since the decision on the violations was not a quasi-judicial decision, the dissent was not recorded. However, a former CEC said on condition of anonymity that such dissenting opinions have to be included in the final order even in cases of MCC violations.\nIn 2017, the then EC OP Rawat recused himself from cases related to the Aam Aadmi Party after party leader Arvind Kejriwal questioned his independence.\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE ON"

            "Update: The NASCAR All-Star Race took place Saturday night. Kyle Larson won the race and the $1 million prize.\nWhat channel is the NASCAR race on today? What time does the NASCAR race start? These are the questions that plague race fans every Sunday \u2014 or, in this case, Saturday \u2014 when each Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race will be on either FOX or FS1 for the first half of the 2019 season with differing start times.\nAs for Saturday's All-Star Race at Charlotte Motor Speedway, the channel that will broadcast the race is FS1. The start time for the Monster Energy Open is 6 p.m. ET, and the start time for the All-Star Race itself is 8:30 p.m. ET. The start time for the pre-race show on FS1 is 5 p.m. ET.\nMORE: Watch the NASCAR All-Star Race live with fuboTV (7-day trial)\nThe 6 p.m. ET start time for Saturday's NASCAR Cup races signals the third night race of the 2019 season. As for the TV channel, the NASCAR Cup Series returns to FS1 for the third week in a row. As part of FOX's TV deal with NASCAR for the 2019 season, FOX was slated to show nine Cup races this year, and FS1 was scheduled to show eight, including the All-Star Race.\nSaturday's All-Star Race at Charlotte Motor Speedway, which will consist of four stages (30 laps, 20 laps, 20 laps, 15 laps), is the 13th race on the NASCAR Cup Series schedule, though it is not a point race. Below is all the info you need regarding how to watch the race.\nWhat channel is NASCAR on today? Time, TV for All-Star Race\nRace : All-Star Race at Charlotte Motor Speedway\n: All-Star Race at Charlotte Motor Speedway Date : Saturday, May 18\n: Saturday, May 18 Start time : 6 p.m. ET (Open) | 8:30 p.m. ET (All-Star Race)\n: 6 p.m. ET (Open) | 8:30 p.m. ET (All-Star Race) TV channel : FS1\n: FS1 Live stream : Fox Sports Go | fuboTV\n: Fox Sports Go | fuboTV Radio: PRN, SiriusXM NASCAR Radio\nThe All-Star Race at Charlotte Motor Speedway on Saturday will be the fifth race of the season to be shown on FS1.\nDrivers who are not eligible to compete in the All-Star Race will try to race their way into the main event Saturday night via the Monster Energy Open, a three-segment race (20 laps, 20 laps, 10 laps) that takes place before the All-Star Race with a start time of 6 p.m. ET. The winners at the end of each segment in the Monster Energy Open will be added to the All-Star field, as will the winner of a fan vote.\nIn addition to the TV coverage on FS1, Saturday night's race is available via live stream through FOX Sports Go or fuboTV. New fuboTV users can sign up with a seven-day free trial.\nMORE: Full TV schedule for All-Star weekend\nLast year's All-Star Race brought a big change in terms of the rules package, one that fueled the permanent change NASCAR made to the aerodynamics and engine specs of its Cup cars for 2019. This year's All-Star Race will feature more changes, some that might be implemented in the Generation 7 car that should be in place by 2021.\nHere are the two new rules components for the All-Star Race, from NASCAR's release:\n\"The first is single-piece carbon fiber splitter/pan that should offer dramatic improvements in ride height sensitivity for the drivers. This technical component will provide a more stable aero platform and create more consistent performance in traffic. \"Also, the car will be configured with a radiator duct which exits through the hood as opposed to the current design which exits into the engine compartment. This feature will create improved aerodynamic parity and, at the same time, reduce engine temperatures.\"\nMORE: Full 2019 NASCAR Cup Series schedule\nSo far, 15 drivers have qualified for the All-Star Race by winning a race in 2018 or 2019, being a past All-Star Race winner or being a past NASCAR Cup Series champion. The winners of each of the three stages (20 laps, 20 laps and 10 laps) in the Monster Energy Open race will move into the feature, as will the driver who wins the fan vote.\nFor the first time in his Cup Series career, Chase Elliott earned his spot in the All-Star Race by virtue of race wins and not the fan vote. He won his first, second and third career Cup races last season and already has another victory (Talladega) this season.\nElliott's teammate, Jimmie Johnson, can enter the All-Star Race with high hopes, especially given the unknowns around the new rules package. Johnson has four career All-Star Race wins, the most for any driver."

            "Mick Jagger\u2014one of the last great rock stars\u2014is 75 years old. As Billboard reported, he had heart surgery just one month ago, undergoing a valve procedure in which doctors put in a stent to treat blockage and weakened arteries. The Rolling Stones had to postpone a tour due to Jagger\u2019s health issues, and he clearly went through quite the ordeal.\nHe now looks amazing. We are pleased to report that Mick Jagger can very much still get it.\nAt 8:30 AM EST this morning, Jagger posted a video to his social accounts of a recent dance rehearsal. He wiggles and weaves and struts and makes \u201ccome and get it\u201d motions in his inimitable way, never missing a step. He has far more energy than this blogger. You must watch!\nJagger\u2019s moves (memorably immortalized in a Maroon 5 song) are the stuff of legend. Consider the way he swivels his head, the high knees, the confident rubbing of the torso. His dancing is hot!\nIn 2012, Jagger\u2019s brother Christopher penned a piece for Rolling Stone chronicling Mick\u2019s evolution as a dancer. His first-ever dance teacher was their mother. \u201cMum tried to teach me, and we waltzed around the living room to the strains of Victor Sylvester,\u201d Jagger said. \u201cHe would be on the old Light Programme, giving instructions, and then we would trot around the room attempting the steps, with me trying not to tread on Mum\u2019s toes.\u201d\nWhile Jagger certainly improved from his \u201chopeless\u201d dancing as a preteen, the real spark came after watching Little Richard perform, and seeing a James Brown show at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. He never stops rehearsing. \u201cYou can\u2019t have enough rehearsals,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a football team.\u201d\nJagger\u2019s non-dancing-related content is also pretty delightful.\nRelated: Mick Jagger Has Been Leaving Comments on His Son Lucas Jagger\u2019s Instagram"

            "Get ready for chaos (Picture: Reuters, Getty)\nThe campest, most ludicrous and endurance-testing day of the year has finally arrived \u2013 and we are pumped.\nYep, the Eurovision Song Contest grand final airs tonight, with 26 nations battling to be crowned champion and host the 2020 contest in their country. Except if Australia win \u2013 then the UK or Germany might host. Yes, it\u2019s confusing.\nWhile this year\u2019s contest features much political tension and calls to boycott Israel\u2019s hosting of the show, Australia possibly winning the whole thing and an Icelandic band in gimp masks, it is classic Eurovision \u2013 meaning we can pretty much predict what\u2019s going to happen throughout the show.\nSo prepare yourself for four hours of general chaos.\nThere will be numerous mentions of unity and togetherness\nEurovision is all about delivering a message of diversity, despite once holding a contest in Kiev with the theme of unity with three white male hosts, and unity \u2013 and that will most likely be drilled in throughout the night by the four hosts, Assi Azar, Bar Refaeli, Erez Tel and Lucy Ayoub. Europe is one, guys!\nThis will then cause major, and understandable, backlash due to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and the ongoing conflict in Gaza.\nEurovision is about unity, guys (Picture: Getty Images Europe)\nThere\u2019ll be an anti-Israel protest\nRemember when poor SuRie\u2019s performance was crashed by a stage invader last year? We can see a repeat of that from a pro-Palestinian protestor, who will either crash the stage during a host link, try and steal Israeli entry Kobi Marimi\u2019s mic, or photobomb a camera in the crowd with anti-apartheid messages on a placard.\nUnfortunately, their message probably won\u2019t be heard due to poor sound and everyone will be very confused.\nBrexit will be addressed\nProbably not by the hosts \u2013 nobody else really cares \u2013 but poor Graham Norton will have to assure viewers that yes, once the UK leaves the European Union, they will still be able to enter Eurovision.\nHonestly, that should have been put in the referendum pamphlets.\nPeople will question why Australia are in the contest\nAustralia joined Eurovision in 2015, but a lot of viewers are still baffled as to why they\u2019re allowed enter. Well, the Aussies love Eurovision, and were invited in 2015 as part of the 60th anniversary celebrations. They did well, so they stayed on, but now they have to attempt to qualify via the semi-finals rather than gaining an automatic pass to the final.\nAnd if you need to explain to your mum or whoever why non-European countries like Israel, Cyprus and Armenia are in the contest, it\u2019s because members of the European Broadcasting Union can compete, and it has nothing to do with geography. So there.\nThis makes us nervous (Picture: JACK GUEZ/AFP/Getty Images)\nIceland will be the most talked about act of the night\nEvery Eurovision needs a totally bats*** act that doesn\u2019t look like they fit into Eurovision \u2013 take Lordi, who performed in full beast prosthetics and won with metal track Hard Rock Hallelujah. Taking the honour this year is Iceland\u2019s entry Hatari, who describe themselves as an anti-capitalist industrial BDSM art collective, and they had us at anti-capitalist.\nThey will be performing their song Hatrio mun sigra (\u2018Hate will prevail\u2019) wearing leather, latex and masks, in front of a large metal cage and surrounded by pyrotechnics. It\u2019s a real trip.\nBut the song is actually a banger, and we are pinning all our hopes on it making it into the top five. Europe contains Berlin. They\u2019ll love this.\nEurovision final running order Malta Albania Czech Republic Germany Russia Denmark San Marino North Macedonia Sweden Slovenia Cyprus Netherlands Greece Israel Norway United Kingdom Iceland Estonia Belarus Azerbaijan France Italy Serbia Switzerland Australia Spain\nThe Netherlands will probably win\nDuncan Laurence and his song Arcade have been favourites to win for months now, and that hasn\u2019t changed following the semi-finals. While there\u2019s not many bells and whistles on the Sam Smith, James Blake-esque ballad, it\u2019s a great song and Duncan performs it beautifully \u2013 so we\u2019ll be in no way disappointed if he does take the crown.\nAmsterdam 2020 sounds great, tbh.\nOne act will have an absolute disaster\nWe\u2019d love for all 26 performances to go without a hitch, but we\u2019re also messy b****es who live for drama, so we\u2019re all kind of hoping for a slip-up.\nThe dream would be a backing dancer falling over \u2013 like, remember that man dressed as a house fell off stage during Katy Perry\u2019s performance at the Brits? Sublime.\nBut the performance that makes us most nervous is Kate Miller-Heidke from Australia, who performs Zero Gravity atop a 16ft sway pole. Importantly, her microphone is not attached to her in any way. What if she drops it?!\nOr, y\u2019know, Madonna could get dragged backwards off stage by her cape again.\nAh, Eurovision (Picture: AP)\nThe scoring will be roughly 15 hours long\nWe love the excitement of the results but dear god, they never end. Every nation will decide to prefix the scores with gushing praise for Israel\u2019s show, which is all very nice, Belarus, but can we please move on, it\u2019s half 11 and we still have 18 countries to go.\nAt least 5 countries will inevitably have technical difficulties and a) announce the wrong votes for the wrong country, b) talk over the hosts or c) stand there in silence against the background of a Eurovision party.\nAnd of course, there\u2019ll be one spokesperson who makes it all about them. Do you really need to start singing???\nThe UK won\u2019t do as well as we\u2019d hoped\nNow, Michael Rice can sing. The man has pipes. And Bigger Than Us is actually a decent song. But forget about any thoughts of making the top 10, because this is a pretty strong year, and we can\u2019t see Michael leapfrogging acts like Malta and Cyprus to make it to the better half of the scoreboard.\nBut he should hold his head high either way, because it\u2019s all heading in the right direction.\nYou\u2019ll be furious that Fuego didn\u2019t win last year\nEleni Foureira is back for a special interval performance, with Mans Zelmerlow performing her 2018 entry for Cyprus, Fuego.\nIt came second behind Netta\u2019s Toy, and no disrespect to Netta, but HOW DID IT NOW WIN? It is a bop for the ages, and it came with hairography. It was ROBBED.\nYes, we\u2019re still a bit angry.\nYou\u2019ll play a drinking game, mess up your pacing and be drunk by song 10\nWe\u2019ve all been there.\nThe Eurovision Song Contest airs tonight from 8pm on BBC One.\nGot a showbiz story?

            "Dozens of Taylor University faculty members and graduating students walked out of Mike Pence\u2019s commencement speech on Saturday morning.\nThe group quietly exited the auditorium in protest of the appropriateness of Pence\u2019s presence at the graduation ceremony in Upland, Indiana. Shortly before the vice president delivered the nondenominational Christian liberal arts school\u2019s commencement speech, many were seen leaving their seats.\nThe protest had been planned beforehand, as controversy surrounded his invitation to speak at the commencement ceremony when it was announced earlier this month, according to the Indianapolis Star.\nPence, 59, has remained a controversial figure in an already controversial Trump administration, with the former Indiana governor having a history of anti-LGBTQ political positions.\nDuring his commencement address, he took the opportunity to express his religious beliefs in front of the 494 graduates\n\u201cThroughout most of our American history it\u2019s been pretty easy to call yourself a Christian, but things are different now,\u201d Pence said during his speech, according to the Star. \u201cLately, it\u2019s become acceptable, even fashionable, to malign traditional Christian beliefs.\u201d\nNot everyone shared the protestors opinion of the Vice President, as Pence received a standing ovation after the walkout.\nBut for the dozens of graduates and faculty members who left in protest of Pence\u2019s speech, the walkout made the statement that his presence was not entirely welcomed by the Taylor University student body.\n\u201cI thought it was a really inappropriate decision,\u201d graduate Laura Rathburn, who joined protestors in walking out on Pence\u2019s commencement address, told the Star. \u201cI think his presence makes it difficult for everyone at Taylor to feel welcomed.\u201d\nStickers created by the school\u2019s social work department and distributed to the protestors read, \u201cWe are Taylor too,\u201d in protest of the Vice President\u2019s speech.\nEvan Vucci/AP/REX/Shutterstock\nPence is the first official from the U.S. executive branch to speak at the Christian university of about 2,500 students.\nProtesters cited the lack of input from students and faculty regarding the choice of Pence for the ceremony\u2019s commencement speech.\nPence spoke last Saturday at Liberty University\u2019s commencement ceremony in Lynchburg, Virginia, and is scheduled to speak to U.S. Army cadet graduates at West Point next Saturday."

US oil giant Exxon Mobil, Italy\u2019s ENI and a couple other companies had been involved in drilling an ultra-deep oil well.\nSpeaking exclusively to Geo News, Babar said the process of drilling up to more than 5500 meters was completed on Kekra-1 (Indus G-Block) off Karachi coast.\nHe said Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) and Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) also assisted Exxon Mobil and ENI in drilling the oil well.\nThe PM's aide said the office of DG Petroleum Concessions has been apprised of the results of drilling.\nHe further informed that the cost of drilling project, which has now been abandoned, remained over $100 million.\nEarlier this year, Prime Minister Imran Khan had said Pakistan would not need to import oil after reserves were found near Karachi coast.\n\"We are hopeful of finding large reserves of gas and oil in the sea near Karachi. The nation should pray for this and I will soon share good news regarding this,\" Khan had told reporters in Islamabad.\n\"God willing the reserves will be so large that we will not need to import any oil.\""

            "Leave it to the Horned Frogs to make things interesting to close out the regular season.\nAfter winning their previous two series in conference play, TCU Baseball started their week with another Tuesday night dud, dropping a 10-5 decision to Lamar, plummeting their RPI to 80 and putting another nail in the coffin of their postseason dreams.\nThat sent the Frogs on the road to Lubbock for a three game set against one of the league-leaders, eighth ranked Texas Tech. Nick Lodolo, making the likely last regular season start of his collegiate career, took the mound against Micah Dallas, who came into the game with a 4-0 record and a 3.60 ERA.\nBoth pitchers were lights out under the lights; Dallas scattered seven hits across 7.0 scoreless frames while striking out eight and walking just two. He worked his way out of several jams, hitting his spots when he needed to most. Lodolo was even better, throwing eight shutout frames while tying a career high with 13Ks. He held the potent Red Raider offense to just five hits and walked none.\nThough both teams had their chances in regulation, the starting pitching and bullpens delivered time and time again. Four relievers combined to strike out 19 Red Raiders across 14 innings of work, with each reliever working around jams via the K. The first run to score came in an unusual way; Johnny Rizer singled and advanced to third with two outs, bringing up Conner Shepherd. Shep struck out, but strike three was dropped, and as the Tech catcher went to throw him out and end the frame, apparently the turf monster got him:\nNot how it was drawn up but... Frogs lead!! Johnny Rizer singles, steals second and moves to third on an error and then this happens... #GoFrogs pic.twitter.com/z2rEXHyqcm \u2014 TCU Baseball (@TCU_Baseball) May 17, 2019\nIt wouldn\u2019t have been a fitting way for a TCU-tech sporting event in Lubbock to end, as it seems these two teams often endure a dose of chaos. But the game continued when the Red Raiders doubled home a run - initially ruled out, the play was overturned on review.\nA pair of scoreless frames followed until the Frogs finally got some breathing room in the 14th, when TCU loaded the bases thanks to singles by Conner Shepherd and Adam Oviedo preceded a Bobby Goodloe walk. Zach Humphreys took his place in the batter\u2019s box with two down and the bags packed, and delivered a two run double to make it a 3-1 ball game.\nTech didn\u2019t go quietly in the bottom of the inning, putting the tying runs on with one out. But Augie Mihlbauer struck out the final two batters he faced to give the Frogs a dramatic W.\nWith the victory, TCU Baseball moves to 29-21 overall and 11-11 in Big 12 play. The Frogs and Texas Tech face off in game two tonight, with first pitch scheduled for 6:30 on FSSW+."

            "DALLAS \u2014 A Dallas man previously arrested in the death of an 81-year-old woman has been charged with killing at least 11 more elderly women whose jewelry and other valuables he stole, authorities said Thursday.\nKim Leach, a spokeswoman for the Dallas County district attorney\u2019s office, said 46-year-old Billy Chemirmir was indicted Tuesday on six more counts of capital murder in the deaths of women ranging in age from 76 to 94.\nChemirmir, a Kenyan citizen who was living in the U.S. illegally, also is charged in nearby Collin County with two counts of attempted capital murder for similar attacks there, according to county court records.\nA Collin County grand jury also returned five capital murder indictments against Chemirmir on Tuesday.\nChemirmir has been in custody since March 2018 in the death of the 81-year-old Dallas woman, Lu Thi Harris. Police in Plano were investigating Chemirmir in connection with suspicious death and suspicious person calls at a senior apartment complex in that Dallas suburb and found evidence linking him to Harris\u2019 death in Dallas, authorities said. Plano is in Collin County.\nThe break in the case came when Chemirmir forced his way into the Plano apartment of a 91-year-old woman that March, telling her to \u201cgo to bed. Don\u2019t fight me,\u201d according to an arrest affidavit filed in Collin County. The woman was smothered with a pillow into unconsciousness and robbed. However, paramedics revived her and she told investigators that her attacker had stolen a box containing her jewelry. Police identified Chemirmir from a license plate number and were able to find and tail him days later, when they watched him throw a jewelry box into a trash bin. They traced the box to Harris, according to the affidavit.\nPlano police Chief Gregory Rushin said at the time that Chemirmir used his health care experience \u201cto his advantage in targeting and exploiting seniors, some of the most vulnerable people in our community.\u201d\nPolice said then that investigators were reviewing about 750 unattended deaths of elderly women for possible links.\nChemirmir\u2019s attorney, Phillip Hayes, said Thursday that this week\u2019s charges were a surprise and that he hadn\u2019t had time to review them yet.\n\u201cThese cases came out of the blue and I don\u2019t have any information on them yet,\u201d he said.\nBut he noted that Chemirmir \u201chas denied it since Day 1\u201d that he played any role in Harris\u2019 death. \u201cThey have circumstantial evidence that puts him in the area but that\u2019s as far as the evidence goes,\u201d Hayes said.\nIn addition to the murder charges, Chemirmir is being held on a charge of being in the country illegally."

            "A province in dire need of stable government instead gets a minority, and a likely return to the polls in the near future\nSo nobody won in Newfoundland and Labrador\u2014not really.\nIt was a snap election the people of Newfoundland didn\u2019t particularly want. The two leading parties, the governing Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives, were so alike that one voter said she could close her eyes and put a check mark next to either one. Another joked she could choose via \u201ceeny, meeny, miny, moe.\u201d\nAnd after a campaign criticized for its paucity of policy ideas to address the province\u2019s dire financial position, the people of Newfoundland will now have a minority government in the House of Assembly\u2014with no clear path to the stable leadership the province badly needs.\nThe Liberals narrowly held off the blue wave that has taken over many provincial legislatures in Canada, but with most of the votes counted, Premier Dwight Ball\u2019s party stood to win only 20 of 40 seats in the provincial House of Assembly, while the Progressive Conservatives were leading in 15 ridings. The NDP was leading in three while Independent candidates had been declared in two.\n\u201cThe message they\u2019re sending to us is we must come together,\u201d Ball told an audience in Deer Lake after TV stations had called the result.\nThat message certainly wasn\u2019t received by PC leader Ches Crosbie. \u201cWe have a situation of constitutional instability,\u201d he said in his post-election speech. \u201cWhere will this end up? It will not end up with Dwight Ball as Premier of Newfoundland one year from now.\n\u201cI am not conceding victory the Liberals,\u201d he added. \u201cThey will have to struggle for the next few months and years to hang onto power.\u201d And what the Liberals won\u2019t have next time, he stressed, is the ability to \u201cuse every possible advantage of power to cut short the democratic process \u2026 to pull the rug out under from under the NDP\u2019s feet and the PC party\u2019s feet.\u201d\nCrosbie\u2019s reference was well understood by partisans and regular voters alike. Ball had gotten a head start on the campaign last month with a snap election called within 24 hours of releasing the budget, leaving the opposition scrambling to start the campaign.\nThe Liberals, as a result, were the only party fully prepared out of the gates with a platform, a full slate of candidates, all 27 incumbents seeking re-election, little fear of vote-splitting with the NDP and money in their war chest.\n\u201cThe fact that it was called this early did catch us off guard a little bit,\u201d acknowledged PC campaign manager Robert Lundrigan before the votes came in. \u201cWe had a few candidates who could not sign on until the last second.\u201d\nThe PCs could only register 39 candidates in the province\u2019s 40 ridings before deadline, and booted another candidate out only a week before the election when anti-abortion and anti-gay marriage views were uncovered on his social media history.\nThe NDP was even less prepared. Once considered on the verge of Official Opposition, the party struggled mightily to find viable candidates, as infighting and organizational problems limited it to 14 before the deadline.\nIt was shaping up to be a missed opportunity of glaring proportion. \u201cNewfoundlanders blame the economic climate on the PC party that was in government for a long time, while also not feeling confidence in the Liberals because of harassment in the House, new taxes and the [deficit reduction] levy,\u201d said Amanda Bittner, a political science professor at the Memorial University of Newfoundland. \u201cThe people want change. If the NDP had been better organized, there might have been more a feeling to a switch to something new.\u201d\nYet when the smoke had cleared, the early election call appeared to have backfired. The Tories came close to pulling the same share of the popular vote the Liberals did, while the NDP performed surprisingly well, winning three seats. Along with the two won by Independents, they held the potential to give the New Democrats and leader Alison Coffin the balance of power.\n\u201cThe Liberals played the game\u2014hard,\u201d said Russell Williams, head of the Department of Political Science at the Memorial University of Newfoundland; but Ball\u2019s early election call may have left many voters cynical because it appeared to be a self-serving move.\n\u201cThey created a budget with no intention to debate it in the House, and called the election when the other parties weren\u2019t organized,\u201d agreed Bittner. \u201cIt was not taking voters or democracy seriously when we have a lot of challenges. People know politics is a game, but when that becomes too crass, then folks aren\u2019t happy.\u201d\nWhatever the reason for the Liberals\u2019 backslide\u2014their seat count is down seven from when the election was called\u2014it will almost certainly trigger a round of negotiations to choose a Speaker, much like after the 2017 B.C. election. All eyes will be on the two Independents, one of whom left the Liberals amid allegations of harassment and bullying in the House.\n\u201cIt is important that we work together for all the people of Newfoundland and Labrador,\u201d Ball said in a post-election speech in Corner Brook. \u201cI will continue to welcome collaboration within the House of Assembly. People expect that from their elected officials.\u201d\nPerhaps, but after failing to deliver on promises from their last campaign to reverse an HST increase and make sure no public-sector workers were laid off, the Liberals weren\u2019t seen as entirely trustworthy. Meanwhile, fresh promises\u2014like a cutting the tax on auto insurance and doing away with the unpopular \u201cdebt reduction levy\u201d on residents earning more than $50,000 annually\u2014often fell on deaf ears. They came, after all, from the same party that introduced the taxes a few years ago, presenting them as difficult but necessary decisions.\nAnd delivering on such pledges will be no easier now that it was three and a-half years ago. The province has the oldest population in Canada, a falling GDP for 2018, and the highest debt per capita in its history. The Liberals presented few policy platforms that would address the budget deficit in a substantial way, be it to increase revenue or reign spending.\nThey were reduced instead to playing effective defence, emphasizing to voters that the dire finances they inherited from the PCs could not be fixed in only four years and hammering on how the Muskrat Falls \u201cboondoggle\u201d took place under the PCs tenure as the province\u2019s finances turned south. Crosbie tried to distance himself from Muskrat Falls, saying it was now a different PC party under new leadership\u2014even if the PC\u2019s were in power from 2003-2015.\nUnfortunately for the PC leader, many voters keen for change saw little to choose between his program and Ball\u2019s. In the riding of St. John\u2019s West, local resident doctor Chris Fraser said he and friends found not only that both parties emphasized the same issues, but that they proposed the same ideas to address them. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the hat they\u2019re wearing barely matters,\u201d he says.\nWhile Fraser was impressed by Crosbie, he was less wowed by his local PC candidate. Stuck between casting a ballot for the benefit of the PC leader or for his preferred local Liberal representative, he was undecided until the morning of election day. He picked the red hat.\nSoon, he and the rest of the people of Newfoundland and Labrador may have to do it all over.\n\u201cThe loser in this election is undoubtedly the public,\u201d lamented Williams. \u201cThe public is going to get a response to this [fiscal] situation that they didn\u2019t understand when they went to the ballot box. That\u2019s bad for the public, bad for the economy of the province and bad for democracy.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with election results and quotes"

The 29-year-old is considered one of the favourites to win the maglia rosa and he will now wear the famous jersey on tomorrow\u2019s stage two.\nYates has also been tipped to contend for the overall prize, given how close he came 12 months ago and his Vuelta triumph, and on this evidence he is certainly in shape to challenge. He rolled down the ramp late in the day and despite fears that a forecasted thunderstorm might scupper his bid, he avoided the rains to finish the testing 8km in 13min 13sec.\nBehind Nibali in third was Miguel Angel Lopez, Team Astana\u2019s Colombian rider who was also expected to finish further down the field given his slighter frame, in a ride that suggests he too will be a threat. Dumoulin came in a disappointing fifth while Team Ineos\u2019s talented Londoner Tao Geoghegan Hart came in a highly creditable sixth.\nSunday\u2019s stage two is a 205km ride from Bologna to Fucecchio."

But after suffering a heart attack while tackling a kidnapper and almost getting beaten to death because of it, he is forced to use a gun, thus breaking his cardinal rule, which ultimately leads him to retire his Dark Knight alter ego.\nIt is two decades later in the year 2039 he crosses paths with 16-year old McGinnis, whom he eventually allows to take on the mantle of Batman to deal with a new wave of villains, with the original rogues gallery of The Joker, The Penguin, The Riddler et al either dead, incarcerated or retired.\nOn Thursday Variety reported that Pattinson had been cast as Batman, but a subsequent report by Deadline claimed he was only on a shortlist, along with Nicholas Hoult.\n\"The Batman\" is slated to hit theatres on June 25, 2021.\nHe's no Bruce Wayne. Please be Terry McGinnis. Please make it Batman Beyond. I wanna the Batman Beyond suit in action! pic.twitter.com/Y29s4Ikto4 @heyjpc\nCan you imagine Robert Pattinson playing Terry McGinnis (Batman Beyond) though? pic.twitter.com/am5bfK9E6Y @PalletTownGrad\nconsider: Robert Pattinson doesn't play Bruce Wayne, but instead plays Terry McGinnis, and we can get a live action Batman Beyond. @ekansthepokemon\nI'll give Robert Pattinson a chance as a younger Batman, absolutely.\nEven better, make him Terry from Beyond and have one of the older actors do an old Bruce Wayne.\nWhat I'm saying is DO A BATMAN BEYOND MOVIE. @TheBY2K\nHope Robert Pattinson plays the Batman from batman beyond and Michael Keaton plays old Bruce Wayne. @Philzao4life\nRobert Pattinson as Batman? Nope.\nRobert Pattinson as Batman Beyond with Michael Keaton as Batman/Mentor? Yes. @haikalclassic"

            "Mr Local tries to keep the stars as equals, but it never comes off that way\nMr Local tries to keep the stars as equals, but it never comes off that way\nSurely, it was only going to be a matter of time before director Rajesh and Sivakarthikeyan joined hands. The combination has a lot going for it \u2013 Rajesh\u2019s liking for light-hearted sequences, the ones that we still diligently watch on television, was always going to be a good match with Sivakarthikeyan\u2019s sensibilities.\nMr Local, the recent offering to come out of this happy marriage, is filled with things that we expect . The issue is that it does only that.\nManohar (Sivakarthikeyan) is not very different from Rajesh\u2019s earlier protagonists Siva ( Siva Manasula Sakthi ), and Baskaran ( Boss Engira Baskaran ), except for the fact that he has a job. He works in what looks to be a posh car company, but his environs are still very middle-class. Back home, he still wears a lungi and jovially fights with his sister.\nBut that is not the brawl that Mr Local wants to focus on. Its intention is to zoom in on the Tom-and-Jerry-like relationship between Manohar and Keerthana (Nayanthara) \u2013 one that kickstarts in the most likeliest of places: the traffic signal. It\u2019s a sign, I suppose, of things to come \u2013 Mr Local is as predictable as we thought it would be.\nMr Local Genre: Comedy\nCast: Sivakarthikeyan, Nayanthara, Radhikaa, Yogi Babu\nStoryline: What happens when a middle-class man clashes with a rich CEO?\nBut that is not such a bad thing, especially when we have Yogi Babu and Satish holding fort in the first half and dishing out some admittedly-funny hero\u2019s-best-friend comedy lines. Robo Shankar is wasted, but the other two ensure that we don\u2019t miss Santhanam, one of the highlights in most of Rajesh\u2019s films.\nThe director might have done well to focus on the comedy, because when he gets into serious zone \u2013 the tiff-off between the lead pair, and the subsequent romance \u2013 it starts trailing off. Mr Local tries to keep the stars as equals, but it never comes off that way...Sivakarthikeyan, thanks to his goofy expressions, always scores a tad more than Nayanthara, who ends up looking stiff and uptight. Radhikaa, however, scores as a very-relatable mother to Sivakarthikeyan \u2013 watching her play a character obsessed with TV soaps does bring a smile to your face.\nSivakarthikeyan\u2019s presence just about manages to hold Mr Local together. It\u2019s a near-perfect film for him \u2013 one that rides more on his dialogue delivery rather than emotion and action (when will filmmakers ditch the two mandatory fight sequences that just exists for the heck of it?). He seems to have worked on his dancing skills as well \u2013 there are some neat steps in the Hip Hop Adhi-composed \u2018Kalakkal\u2019 and \u2018Takkunu Takkunu\u2019 numbers \u2013 but the songs are all just fillers and contribute little to carry the story forward, which was anyway wafer-thin in the first place."

J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\u201cIt was exciting. It\u2019s historic. It\u2019s not only about what it means in the personal lives of people \u2013 and that would be a sufficient reason to do it, but what it means for America \u2013 the ever expanding freedoms in our country. And that\u2019s the history of our country \u2013 to ever expand freedom,\u201d Pelosi told ABC News Friday afternoon following the vote.\n\u201cWe just had an historic victory,\u201d she added. \u201cSome of us have been working 30 years to get this done.\u201d\nThe bill, which passed 236-173, amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and explicitly prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in education, employment, housing, credit, federal jury service, public accommodations, and the use of federal funds.\n\u201cDespite significant advances, LGBT people across the country remain vulnerable to discrimination on a daily basis and too often have little recourse,\u201d said Rep.David Cicilline, D-R.I., the lead sponsor of the bill. \u201cIt is past time for the Equality Act to be written into law.\u201d\nRep.

Chris Pappas and leaders from LGBTQ advocacy organizations before the House votes on the Equality Act, May 17, 2019, in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\nThe bill passed on a bipartisan basis, with eight Republicans voting alongside Democrats, but some Republican critics adamantly opposed the legislation, and said it would harm religious freedoms.\n\"It\u2019s vague and circular definition of gender identity will lead only to uncertainty, litigation, and harm to individuals and organizations that will be forced to comply with a law the authors don\u2019t even seem to understand,\" Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., said on the House floor Friday. \"This is a classic example of passing something now and figuring out what it actually means later ... If the devil is in the details, we\u2019re in for a lot of devilish surprises.\"\nA trio of Senate Democrats have introduced a similar bill in the upper chamber, however it's unclear if the Republican-led Senate will consider it.\nABC News has reached out to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office for comment.\nABC News' John Parkinson contributed to this report."

            "Moscow (AFP) \u2013\nAdvertising Read more\nRussia on Thursday praised its membership in the Council of Europe ahead of a key summit suggesting Moscow had no immediate plans to quit the continent's top rights watchdog following a bitter row.\nThe noticeable change of tone comes ahead of the watchdog's key meetings on Thursday and Friday which may adopt a document that Kiev claims will ease pressure on Russia despite its role in the Ukraine crisis.\nAs the two-day meetings of the watchdog's Committee of Ministers kick off in Helsinki on Thursday, Kiev threatened to revisit its ties with the Council of Europe if Moscow was allowed to get the upper hand in the dispute.\nKiev is afraid the council will on Friday adopt a document that will help Russia return to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) which deprived the Moscow of voting and other rights after the annexation of Crimea in 2014.\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin cancelled his participation in the Helsinki meetings, sending his deputy instead.\nLawmaker Volodymyr Ariev, head of Ukraine's PACE delegation, who has seen the draft document, said it might help Russia return to PACE on its own terms.\n- 'Serious steps' -\nIf pressure on Russia eases, Ukraine is \"ready to take very serious steps,\" he told AFP.\n\"We are ready to seriously reconsider our involvement with the Council of Europe.\"\nHe accused France and Germany of supporting Russia over Ukraine, Georgia and the Baltic countries.\nThe 47-member council-- which is not linked to the European Union -- promotes democracy and the rule of law across Europe.\nIt is the only major legal mechanism that tethers Russia to Europe.\nRussia has been under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights -- overseen by the rights organisation -- for more than 20 years, becoming its biggest purveyor of cases.\nBut after the annexation of Crimea Moscow's ties with the council reached a crisis point, and Russia threatened to quit.\nMoscow suspended its annual 33 million euro ($37 million) payment to the Strasbourg-based council -- about seven percent of its budget -- and has not participated in PACE sessions.\nRussia could be suspended after two years of non-payment of contributions -- from June this year.\nMore importantly, Moscow may not be able to participate in the June election of the council's next secretary general, and Russia has warned that if this happens it may go.\nA Russian departure -- dubbed \"Ruxit\" -- would have far-reaching consequences including the possible reinstatement of capital punishment.\n- Copious praise -\nBut on Thursday, Moscow put out un upbeat statement praising the Council of Europe.\nThe foreign ministry statement said its Council of Europe membership had helped improve Russia's justice and penitentiary systems and even sports over the past two decades.\n\"Russia is interested in preserving and strengthening the Council of Europe as one of the most authoritative and respectable international organisations on the European continent,\" the foreign ministry said.\nMoscow's top diplomat Sergei Lavrov, who is set to attend the talks, indicated the non-payment of contributions may not be discussed publicly during the Helsinki meetings, in an apparent win for Russia.\nAsked whether he expected the meetings to address non-payment issues, he told reporters Wednesday: \"Nothing of the kind will be discussed.\"\nHe said a draft document had been put together on the issue, but did not elaborate.\n\"I am hoping that justice will be restored,\" Lavrov added.\nRights campaigners warn of a potential intensification of a clampdown on civil society, worsening abuse of prisoners, and a new wave of emigration, if Russia quits the Council of Europe.\nRuxit could also weaken the council itself and create new fault lines in Europe.\n? 2019 AFP"

Ernst Middendorp\nWith Daniel Akpeyi cup tied and Virgil Vries\u2019 ties with the club severed, rising star Bruce Bvuma is almost a sure bet for a starting berth in the absence of the injured Itumeleng Khune.\nVeteran defender Eric Mathoho could aalso make a rare start, having returned from a lengthy injury layoff.\nKaizer Chiefs vs TS Galaxy predicted XIs\nKaizer Chiefs: Bvuma, Moleko, Hadebe, Cardoso, Mphahlele, Katsande, Maluleka, Adrianarimanana, Parker, Billiat, Castro.\nTS Galaxy: Mpakumpaku, Aubaas, Dube, Mashego, Nyama, Setelele, Mbamba, Bodibe, Lepasa, Mdlinzo, Ndlovu.\nNedbank Cup final live scores"
