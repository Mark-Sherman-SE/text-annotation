            "Bill Nye deviated from his kid-friendly \"Science Guy\" persona on Sunday night to help John Oliver talk about the severity of climate change. Nye proved he's not always the mild-mannered nerd millennials grew up with when he joined Oliver during his episode detailing carbon pricing and the Green New Deal.\nOliver first outlined the case for the Green New Deal, the environment and jobs proposal introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \"To its eternal credit, the Green New Deal has succeeded in getting people talking, but that won't mean anything unless that talk turns into action,\" Oliver said.\n\"We're going to need a lot of different policies working tandem, and we have to take action right now,\" the comedian said, towards the end of the segment. \"But you don't have to just take that from me. Instead, I'm happy to say Bill Nye has actually agreed to drive the urgency home at this point by actually doing one of his enjoyable, lighthearted demonstrations.\"\nAfter the tongue-in-cheek introduction, Nye gave a demonstration that was much less lighthearted \u2014 and used much stronger language \u2014 than usual.\n\"By the end of this century, if temperatures keep rising, the average temperature on earth could go up another 4 to 8 degrees,\" Nye said. \"What I'm saying is, the planet's on f****ing fire.\" The Science Guy then took a blowtorch to a globe, setting it ablaze.\n\"There are several options to put out the proverbial fire on Earth,\" Nye explains. \"Are any of them free? No, of course not, you idiots. Grow the f*** up. You're adults now.\"\nAs the globe burns, he declares: \"I didn't mind explaining photosynthesis to you when you were 12, but you're adults now. This is an actual crisis, got it?\" Nye's expletive-laden rant was received with laughter from the audience. Oliver ends the episode by joking that he's \"absolutely on board\" with Nye's \"gritty reboot.\"\nThe tough-talking version of Nye gained widespread attention online and he quickly became a trending topic on Twitter.\n\"Bill Nye is not the one we used to know! He means business,\" one person tweeted.\n\"A VERY important, VERY science-forward message from Bill Nye: 'The planet is on f*ck!ng fire.' Needless to say, Bill understands how dire it is that we turn things around for our planet. It's the only one we've got!\" another person wrote. Several jokingly posted \"Bill Nye 2020.\"\nNot only did Oliver memorably drive home his point about climate change and the Green New Deal, but he also proved that one way to get through to millennials is work with the same Science Guy who got them interested in the world of science when they were kids."

            "Saudi Arabia said on May 13 that two of its oil tankers were among those targeted in a \"sabotage attack\" off the coast of the United Arab Emirates. (Video: Reuters)\nComment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\nBEIRUT \u2014 Two Saudi Arabian oil tankers and a Norwegian ship were damaged over the weekend near the Persian Gulf in what Saudi Arabia claimed Monday was an \u201cact of sabotage,\u201d further heightening regional tensions with Iran. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight There was no immediate indication as to who may have been responsible or why the damage was inflicted, but the incidents occurred at the same time and place off the coast of the United Arab Emirates only days after the United States has dispatched warships and bombers to the area to deter alleged threats from Iran.\nThe location is near a sea lane critical to the world\u2019s supply of oil, and the incidents followed a warning by U.S. maritime authorities that Iran might seek to disrupt commercial shipping in the area.\nOne of the Saudi tankers had been preparing to deliver oil to the United States, and both incurred \u201csignificant damage\u201d as a result of the apparent attack at around 6 a.m. Sunday morning, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said in a statement reported by the official Saudi news agency.\nA statement from Thome Ship Management, the owners of the Norwegian-flagged vessel, said an \u201cunknown object\u201d had created a hole in the hull of one of its ships, the MT Andrea Victory. Photographs of the ship showing a hole just above the waterline have been published, according to the Associated Press.\nAdvertisement\nNeither Saudi Arabia nor the United Arab Emirates produced photographs to support claims that Saudi tankers had been damaged. Falih said the apparent attacks did not cause any casualties or oil spills, and they did not attribute blame for the apparent sabotage.\nIn a May 8 televised address, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said his country would stop complying with parts of the landmark nuclear deal. (Video: Associated Press)\nThe incidents coincide, however, with a surge in U.S.-Iranian tensions after the United States said last week that it has received intelligence that Iran was planning some kind of attack on U.S. forces in the Middle East.\nIn response to the threat, the Pentagon dispatched reinforcements to the Persian Gulf, including an aircraft carrier, a Patriot missile battery and a squadron of B-52 bombers. The moves prompted Iran to warn that it is prepared to retaliate if it is attacked.\nIran\u2019s Foreign Ministry condemned the possible shipping attacks as \u201calarming and regrettable\u201d and said it would have a \u201cnegative effect\u201d on shipping safety and maritime security, according to the Iranian Students\u2019 News Agency.\nAdvertisement\nAbbas Mousavi, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, suggested that the sabotage might have been carried out as part of a conspiracy to ignite conflict in the region. He cautioned against what he called \u201cplots by ill-wishers to disrupt regional security\u201d and called for an inquiry.\nIran also announced last week that it would pull out of parts of its 2015 nuclear deal with major world powers and step up uranium enrichment, raising concern among the accord\u2019s remaining signatories that it will soon collapse altogether.\nSpeaking in Brussels, British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt warned of the risk that the tensions could trigger an unintended conflict in the region.\n\u201cWe are very worried about the risk of a conflict happening by accident with an escalation that is unintended,\u201d he told reporters ahead of a European Union meeting later Monday about ways to salvage the deal.\nThe spike in tensions comes after the Trump administration\u2019s decision to lift sanctions waivers from eight countries that import Iranian oil, in a bid to bring Iran\u2019s exports down to \u201czero,\u201d according to U.S. officials. Iranian imports had already plunged after the United States reimposed sanctions in November, following the Trump administration\u2019s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear accord. The expiration of the waivers is expected to inflict further pain on Iran\u2019s already reeling economy.\nAdvertisement\nIt was not immediately clear whether the two Saudi vessels that were damaged were among four ships that the United Arab Emirates said Sunday were sabotaged in the same area. Hours before the UAE reported the damage to the ships, Iran-linked news outlets had circulated reports that a big attack on the port at Fujairah had set fire to seven ships. Those have since been proved false.\nThe U.S. maritime authority reissued an earlier warning after the Sunday attacks that Iran might seek to target commercial shipping in the area, the Associated Press reported.\n\u201cSince early May, there is an increased possibility that Iran and/or its regional proxies could take action against U.S. and partner interests, including oil production infrastructure, after recently threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz,\u201d an earlier warning issued last week said. \u201cIran or its proxies could respond by targeting commercial vessels, including oil tankers, or U.S. military vessels in the Red Sea, Bab-el-Mandeb Strait or the Persian Gulf.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe State Department also updated a travel advisory to U.S. citizens in Iraq on Monday that was issued in the wake of the rising tensions last week. Among other threats, the advisory cautioned Americans of the risk posed by \u201canti-U.S. sectarian militias,\u201d a reference to the Iranian-backed Shiite militias that play a powerful role in Iraq.\nThe latest advisory simply warned: \u201cDo not travel to Iraq.\u201d\nIraq is one of the locations where Iran may be plotting to attack U.S. interests, U.S. officials have told American news outlets.\nGiftOutline Gift Article"

            "'I want to stay at Real Madrid' - Brahim Diaz plans to fight for starting berth under Zidane\nThe 19-year-old has made eight La Liga appearances since leaving Manchester City in January and has no plans to leave Santiago Bernabeu this summer\nReal Madrid midfielder Brahim Diaz wants to fight for a place in Zinedine Zidane's starting line-up after an impressive end to the 2018-19 campaign.\nThe Spaniard has been in the Blancos squad for their last five La Liga outings, starting three of them and contributing one goal.\nThe teenager's first strike for Madrid came during Sunday's 3-1 defeat to Real Sociedad at Anoeta after he embarked on a superb solo run before confidently slotting into the net just six minutes into the match.\nDiaz moved to Santiago Bernabeu from Manchester City during the January transfer window for a \u00a315.5m ($20m) transfer fee.\nHe has since racked up 10 appearances across all competitions and is planning to establish himself in Zidane's squad permanently next season, despite talk of a possible loan departure.\nSpeaking after Madrid's latest fixture, Diaz stated: \"I want to stay at Real Madrid. We'll see what happens.\"\nThe ex-City starlet also expressed his delight after breaking his scoring duck for the club, before defending the Blancos performance following an 11th La Liga defeat.\n\"It was a nice goal, but it was not worth it because the result was not from our side,\" Diaz added.\n\"We played well at the start, but it was complicated with one less in a field like this.\n\"You can talk about many players. There is a very high level.\n\"We are happy, but with the expulsion it was difficult. We fought until the end.\"\nZidane's side are destined to finish third in the Spanish top flight, with a home clash against Real Betis to take in next Sunday on the final day of the season.\nThe 2018 Champions League winners have failed to land any domestic or European honours over the last 11 months and changes are expected at the club during the summer transfer window.\nOne player who has been linked with a move away from the Bernabeu is Casemiro, but he stated after the loss to Real Sociedad that he's already looking ahead to the 2019-20 campaign.\n\"There are still three points left to play for at home and we're already thinking about next season,\" he said.\n\"We have to try and do better until the very last game. We're working to try and improve, away from home and at home.\""

            "Sri Lankan police on Sunday imposed curfew with immediate effect in the country\u2019s western coastal town of Chilaw after a mosque and few shops owned by Muslims were attacked by a mob, authorities said.\nThe curfew has been imposed till 6 am on Monday as a precaution, the police said.\nAdditional troops have been deployed in the city to bring the situation under control, they said.\nTension was brewing since Saturday between the Catholics and Muslims in the Christian dominated town. This is a fallout from the Easter Sunday attacks in which over 250 people were killed.\nNine suicide bombers, including a woman, carried out a series of devastating blasts that tore through three churches and three luxury hotels, killing 258 people and injuring over 500 others on the Easter Sunday.\nThe Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, but the government has blamed local Islamist extremist group, the National Thawheed Jama\u2019ath (NTJ), for the bombings.\nSome inflammatory exchanges happened between the two communities in the town since Saturday, the residents said.\nA Catholic woman claimed that she was threatened inside a Muslim-owned shop.\nCardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the Archbishop of Colombo, cancelled all masses since the Easter Sunday until the security situation could improve.\nIt was just this morning that churches resumed their normal Sunday services since the attack.\nEarly this month, several people were injured in clashes between Muslims and Christians in Negombo, a majority Christian town where St. Sebastian\u2019s Church was targeted during the Easter attacks.\nAfter clashes in Negombo, Cardinal Ranjith appealed to Christians and other communities to show restraint.\n\u201cI appeal to all Catholic and Christian brothers and sisters not to hurt even a single Muslim person because they are our brothers, because they are part of our religious culture,\u201d said Ranjith.\n\u201cTherefore please avoid hurting them and try to create a better spirit of understanding and good relations between all the communities of Sri Lanka.\u201d\nIn his address to the nation after the Easter Sunday blasts, President Maithripala Sirisena called on the public to refrain from looking at the Muslim community with a suspicious eye following the attacks.\n\u201cIt was only a small group which had engaged in such acts of terror,\u201d he added.\nSri Lanka has a population of 21 million which is a patchwork of ethnicities and religions, dominated by the Sinhalese Buddhist majority.\nMuslims account for 10 per cent of the population and are the second-largest minority after Hindus. Around seven per cent of Sri Lankans are Christians."

            "Forward-looking: Billionaire Jeff Bezos spent an hour on Thursday outlining his vision for the future of his space startup Blue Origin as well as humanity. He wants his company to build the infrastructure that will one day allow future generations to colonize space.\nAt a speech in Washington, Jeff Bezos revealed Blue Moon --- a huge lunar lander that can transport 3.6 tons of cargo to the Moon's surface. The craft has been in development for three years and will be used to shuttle scientific equipment and other payloads, maybe even humans.\nThe Blue Moon will be powered by Blue Origin's new BE-7 engine, which is capable of 10,000 pounds of thrust. Engineers will be test firing the BE-7 for the first time in West Texas sometime this summer.\nBezos indicated that he is behind sending people up as well. Regarding US Vice President Mike Pence's goal of having humans on the Moon by 2024, the Amazon head said he was all for it.\n\"I love this,\" he told the DC crowd. \"It's the right thing to do. We can help meet that timeline but only because we started three years ago. It's time to go back to the Moon --- this time to stay.\"\nHe said that if they equipped the Blue Moon with \"stretch tanks\" it would be able to transport an additional 2.9 tons of cargo. The extra space would be enough for a \"crewed ascent vehicle.\"\nThe Washington Post notes that Bezos did not indicate whether he would be seeking contracts from NASA for payload deliveries, but considering that he is reportedly burning through about a billion dollars per year on Blue Origin, contract requests seem likely.\nHowever, Bezos stopped short of saying we should colonize the Moon. His vision is to build colonies called O'Neill cylinders, named for their creator Gerard O'Neill.\nThese free-floating colonies are made up of two counter-rotating cylinders as to cancel out gyroscopic effects that would knock them out of alignment to the sun. Each tube would be five miles in diameter and twenty miles long. The rotation would provide artificial gravity and energy would be supplied via solar panels on the tubes' exterior.\nBezos imagines a million people living in each cylinder in climate-controlled utopias.\n\"This is Maui on its best day all year long,\" he said. \"No rain. No earthquakes. People are going to want to live here.\"\nOf course, this is not likely something that Bezos can finish in his lifetime. He said his job is to \"build the road\" that could lead to such colonization. The only two obstacles he sees are the costs associated with entering space and discovering ways to utilize off-planet resources.\nBoth problems are priority items that Blue Origin has been working toward with the New Shepard launch system and the Blue Moon lander. He believes that if we can build the infrastructure, future generations can accomplish almost anything in space."

            "Will any flagship smartphone announcement ever be a surprise again? At this point we highly doubt it, considering all the leaks and rumors that precede every single major smartphone unveiling these days. The OnePlus 7 Pro is finally official and while nothing OnePlus announced on Tuesday will come as much of a surprise to anyone who has been following all the leaks, the sleek new flagship phone is no less exciting than it would have been had we not already known everything there is to know.\nThe OnePlus 7 Pro features bleeding-edge specs, more power than any other Android phone on the market right now, and a stunning design that\u2019s unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before in the United States. While OnePlus hasn\u2019t announced a firm figure for the phone\u2019s screen-to-body ratio, this is as close as we\u2019ve come to a true \u201call-screen\u201d phone. There\u2019s no big notch like the one on Apple\u2019s iPhones, no teardrop notch like there was on last year\u2019s OnePlus 6T, and no big bezels anywhere around the screen. It\u2019s gorgeous. The OnePlus 7 Pro is also packed with new features we\u2019ve never seen before on a OnePlus device, including one of the most impressive cameras we\u2019ve ever tested. It\u2019s not all good news, however: the OnePlyus 7 Pro is also the most expensive new flagship phone OnePlus has ever released. It still costs far less than comparable handsets though, and Android fans will be more than willing to pony up when they see how impressive this new flagship phone truly is.\nRelated Stories:\nPixel 3a and OnePlus 7 are both cheap new Android phones, but one is way better than the other\nOnePlus will pay you up to $449 to trade in your phone for a OnePlus 7 Pro\nThe OnePlus 7 Pro is finally here, and it's unlike anything you've seen before\nBefore we dive in, you might be wondering why the OnePlus 7 Pro is the only new OnePlus phone we\u2019re talking about here. It\u2019s an understandable question, considering it\u2019s one of three new smartphones OnePlus unveiled on Tuesday. The answer is pretty simple, though: it\u2019s the only model that will be sold in the US. The entry-level OnePlus 7 won\u2019t be sold here because the OnePlus 6T will remain available instead \u2014 at a new lower price (8GB/128GB for $549, 8GB/256GB for $599) \u2014 and the high-end 5G version of the OnePlus 7 Pro won\u2019t be sold here because 5G networks won\u2019t be widely available in the US for quite some time.\nStory continues\nStarting with the OnePlus 7 Pro\u2019s new design, it\u2019s easily one of the sleekest phones that has ever been built. It features a huge 6.67-inch \u201cFluid AMOLED\u201d screen that is curved on both sides like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S and Note phones. The screen has plenty of cool features like a larger, faster in-display fingerprint sensor and HDR+ support, but two main things separate OnePlus\u2019 new display from anything we\u2019ve seen so far on other phones. First, the OnePlus 7 Pro is the first smartphone to feature a 90 Hz refresh rate, This means animations, scrolling, and pretty much everything else is smoother on the OnePlus phone than it is on rival handsets. Second, the OnePlus 7 Pro\u2019s screen has wonderfully thin bezels all around it, and yet it still doesn\u2019t have a notch like an iPhone or a hole-punch camera like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S10 series. In fact, there\u2019s no selfie camera anywhere to be found on the OnePlus 7 Pro.\nNo, OnePlus isn\u2019t crazy. The company knows most people would never buy a phone without a front facing camera. Instead of placing the camera in a bezel, a notch, or a hole cut out of the screen, OnePlus placed the front-facing camera in a small mechanism that pops up from the top edge of the phone. This happens automatically whenever the front-facing camera is needed, and it raises and lowers quite quickly. It also has an internal grommet to prevent moisture and dirt from getting in, and a cool safety feature to protect it from damage. If the phone\u2019s accelerometer senses a drop while the camera is open, the phone automatically retracts it to avoid damage. In terms of distance, we found in our tests that the camera is fully retracted within about 2 feet.\nSpeaking of cameras, improving the rear camera was a huge focus for OnePlus and the company definitely didn\u2019t fail to impress. A new triple-lens rear camera features a 48-megapixel main sensor, an 8-megapixel 78mm telephoto sensor for 3x optical zoom, and 16-megapixel ultra wide angle lens that captures a whopping 117\u00b0. The first two sensors are both supported by optical image stabilization as well as electronic image stabilization, and the OnePlus 7 Pro\u2019s new autofocus system uses three different technologies \u2014 PDAF, CAF, and laser focus \u2014 to help ensure images are crisp and clear every time. How well does it all come together? The OnePlus 7 Pro\u2019s rear camera scored a 111 on DxOMark\u2019s rigorous testing, just one point off the all-time high.\nWhere speed and performance are concerned, the OnePlus 7 Pro is the most powerful Android smartphone to date. 6GB, 8GB, and 12GB versions are available, and the phone has a RAM Boost feature that automatically and intelligently allocates RAM to certain apps and processes based on the user\u2019s habits. The OnePlus 7 Pro is also the first smartphone to use new UFS 3.0 flash storage chips. According to OnePlus, the phone\u2019s storage is nine times faster than the UFS 2.1 storage used in other handsets. Thanks to the Snapdragon 855 chipset and other optimizations, the large 4,000 mAh battery provides about the same battery life as last year\u2019s OnePlus 6T despite the larger, power-hungry display. It also comes equipped with the Warp Charge 30 tech OnePlus introduced on its McLaren Edition 6T last year.\nThe only real downside to be found is that the OnePlus 7 Pro is more expensive than last year\u2019s OnePlus 6T. We have come to expect a small price increase from one year to the next, but this year\u2019s increase is substantial \u2014 the entry-level OnePlus 6T cost $549 when the phone was released last year, while the most affordable OnePlus 7 Pro is priced at $669. Here\u2019s how the different SKUs are priced:\nOnePlus 7 Pro (Mirror Gray) with 6GB of RAM + 128GB of storage: $669\nOnePlus 7 Pro (Mirror Gray) with 8GB of RAM + 256GB of storage: $699\nOnePlus 7 Pro (Nebula Blue) with 8GB of RAM + 256GB of storage: $699\nOnePlus 7 Pro (Nebula Blue) with 12GB of RAM + 256GB of storage: $749\nIt\u2019s a big price increase compared to last year\u2019s model, but it\u2019s not bad at all when you put these prices in perspective. An iPhone XS Max with 64GB storage costs $1,099, while a OnePlus 7 Pro with 128GB or storage and more RAM is only $669. The 256GB iPhone XS Max costs $1,249, and that\u2019s $550 more than a 256GB OnePlus 7 Pro.\nThe new OnePlus 7 Pro has an official release date of Friday, May 17th, and it\u2019ll launch alongside new \u201cBullets Wireless 2\u201d Bluetooth earbuds for $99. Of note, some OnePlus fans in New York City will be able to get it sooner than that. The phone will be sold by T-Mobile in addition to OnePlus\u2019 online store, and the T-Mobile flagship store in Times Square will begin selling the OnePlus 7 Pro today, March 14th, at 2:00PM ET. T-Mobile will only carry the 8GB/256GB version of the phone, but it will offer both color options.\nThe OnePlus 7 Pro\u2019s complete specs follow below.\nBGR Top Deals:\nTrending Right Now:\nSee the original version of this article on BGR.com"

            "Warning! This article contains spoilers for Game Of Thrones season eight, episode five, The Bells.\nWell. In the end, the bells for peace tolled, but Daenerys Targaryen was having none of it.\nThe deaths of Missandei and Rhaegal in last week's episode did indeed prove to be the straw that broke the dragon's back, finally transforming the once benevolent Khaleesi into the feared Mad Queen who had not-so-subtly been promising to unleash herself throughout this entire final series.\nJon Snow may not want The Truth, but he sure got to find out what happens when The Truth comes out.\nIf The Long Night was the most breathtaking episode of season eight visually (the long dark gripes aside), The Bells was the one that had your heart in its grip from the beginning and never let go.\nGrittier, rawer and perhaps a little less Hollywood, this was bigger than the battle against The Night King and a far more emotionally charged war. Because that was clear-cut, good versus evil; this time, the good turned evil and set the world on fire.\nImage: Arya Stark amid the destruction. Pic: HBO/ Sky Atlantic\nWith so much to tie up, so little time, there will undoubtedly be certain scenes, deaths and questions from this penultimate episode that will divide fans. But for sheer exhilaration, The Bells delivered. This is what Game Of Thrones is all about.\nKing's Landing incinerated\nWith two dragons down and just one left, there had been much speculation about how Daenerys would fare against Cersei Lannister's bigger and less battle-weary army.\nAdvertisement\nWith Rhaegal taken out so quickly (and conveniently) by Euron Greyjoy, would this fight to be more evenly matched than on paper? The answer was a resounding no.\n:: Listen to the Backstage podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker\nGetting to grips with Drogon after infuriatingly retreating from Greyjoy and faffing about with Jon during the Great War before that, the Mother Of Dragons finally showed that swords and spears and massive crossbows are no match for great balls of fire, and not before time.\nIt quickly became apparent that who would win the Last War was never in question, with Drogon obliterating anyone standing in Dany's path.\nOh, if only she'd thought to do this last week! Maybe BFF Missandei would still be alive and there would be no need for all this.\nThis had become about vengeance, and when Cersei's soldiers waved the white flag, Dany carried on, incandescent with rage; destroying King's Landing and killing the thousands of innocent people she had once vowed to rule over peacefully.\nGoodbye, Cersei and Jaime\nThis was the episode where the mask dropped and we saw Cersei, the frightened mother-to-be, desperate to protect her unborn child as her city collapsed around her.\nReunited briefly with Jaime, she was reduced to tears as King's Landing fell. Yes, she's a monster and deserved everything coming, but you couldn't help feeling sorry for her as that rarely seen vulnerable side came out.\nAs the walls caved in around them, the star-crossed twins/lovers died in each other's arms in an ending that will no doubt enrage fans who wanted to see revenge served cold and torturously (to Cersei, obviously, but also to Jaime, who we can't forgive for breaking Brienne's heart).\nBut actually, this was a fitting end. Cersei didn't die battling for the throne and proudly standing up to her enemies, she died helpless and weak - her biggest fear.\nImage: It's goodbye Cersei. Pic: HBO/ Sky Atlantic\n'Someone has betrayed me'\nThe episode started with Varys, foreseeing his death it seems and committing Jon's secret to paper.\nSure enough, Dany quickly ordered his execution by dragon fire, setting the tone for what was to come.\nIf that wasn't enough for lovestruck Jon to have a polite word with the woman he has bent the knee for, surely the destruction of King's Landing and its people will be?\nCome on, Jon! Varys did warn you, mate.\nWith just one episode left, sadly the time for polite words has passed; now is the time to be the hero we have known and loved in seasons before. We know you've got it in you, even if you have been a bit rubbish this series.\nThe Night King is gone. Cersei is gone. The question now is about the final battle for the Iron Throne: now he's witnessed the full scale of her penchant for burning people alive, will the last war be between Jon and Dany?\nCleganebowl\n\"Hello, big brother,\" said The Hound, in the biggest TV reunion since Sharon witnessed the resurrection of Dirty Den.\nThis was the moment Game Of Thrones fans had been waiting for: The Hound versus The Mountain, and it didn't disappoint.\nSwords clanged as the brothers fought to the bitter end, with the superhuman and super-gruesome Mountain surviving everything his brother could throw at him, even a knife straight through the head.\nAs it looked like the Hound was about to become another of his poor eye-crush victims, little brother locked his grip and pulled them both from a wall and down to a fiery death below.\nArya: She's only human, after all\nBefore his death, the Hound and Arya Stark shared their goodbyes.\nAfter arriving in King's Landing announcing her intention to kill Cersei, once the city started to fall the Hound was quick to point out to Arya that continuing with him meant certain death.\nAfter slaying the Night King and becoming the hero of Winterfell, and turning down Gendry's proposal to pursue her quest for killing, the young assassin had become almost robotic in her search for vengeance.\nBut the Hound's words resonated. \"You think you've wanted revenge a long time? I've been after it all my life, it's all I care about, and look at me. You want to be like me? You come with me, you die here.\"\nSuddenly, she was little Arya Stark again. \"Thank you,\" she whispered as she turned to flee, the understanding that this was farewell as the Hound left to meet his fate.\nImage: Many are killed in the inferno. Pic: HBO/ Sky Atlantic\nBrotherly love\nBefore his death, Jaime also had a poignant reunion with his other sibling, Tyrion.\n\"If it weren't for you, I never would have survived my childhood,\" Tyrion told his brother. \"You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had.\"\nIt was an emotional scene.\nTrying to do the right thing, Tyrion betrayed his queen and freed Jaime from capture, wanting to save him and also believing he was the one who could bring about peace.\nHe knew his fate should Daenerys find out.\n\"Tens of thousands of innocent lives, one not particularly innocent dwarf,\" he said. \"Seems like a fair trade.\"\nIn the end, Tyrion was the last Lannister standing.\nAnd finally\u2026\nViewers who kept up with other fan favourite Line Of Duty will have spotted a familiar face in King's Landing this week.\nDetective Inspector Michelle Brandyce, who popped up in the final episodes of the police drama, had inexplicably hot-footed it from AC-12 to Westeros.\nWhat's worse, you wonder: bent coppers and an OCG, or angry dragons?\nSadly for the DI, it turned out to be the dragons, and she met a fiery end along with her young daughter.\nOh, Ma'am. When DI Kate Fleming told you to \"stop making a t*t out of yourself and p*ss off\", I'm not sure this was quite the punishment she had in mind.\nSo this is it. The end is nigh. Take a look at what's in store next week in the very last trailer.\nTwitter Due to your consent preferences, you\u2019re not able to view this.

            "A pilot was arrested and charged Saturday in the murders of a Kentucky couple, as well as a neighbor.\nChristian Richard Martin, 51, who works for a subsidiary of American Airlines, was detained as he prepared for takeoff, a moment described by a passenger as something like out of a movie.\nAccording to the passenger, they were boarding the early-morning flight from Louisville to Charlotte, North Carolina, when police officers escorted their uniformed pilot off the plane in handcuffs. A short while later, they were told the flight had been canceled.\nMartin, a former Army Ranger major, is accused of killing Calvin Phillips; his wife, Pamela Phillips; and Edward Dansereau in 2015. Pamela and Dansereau were found dead inside a burned-out car several miles away from where Calvin's body was discovered at his home in Pembroke, Kentucky.\nCalvin had been scheduled to testify against Martin in a military court martial when he was killed. Martin was found guilty of assaulting his wife at his court martial but was acquitted of the more serious charge of sexual assault. He joined the American subsidiary PSA Airlines last year.\nInside Edition spoke to Matt Phillips about his parents' deaths. \"My folks were wonderful, wonderful people and I miss them terribly,\" said Matt. \"This is devastating to a family.\"\n\"Pilots undergo a criminal background check and recurrent vetting,\" an American Airlines statement read. \"Martin did not have any criminal history that would disqualify him from being a commercial pilot.\"\nMartin is suspended pending the investigation.\nIn an interview in 2016, Martin, who'd been a suspect in the crimes from the start, denied any knowledge of the murders. \"I don't know why anybody would want to do something to them,\" said Martin.\nFor his part, Matt is eagerly anticipating seeing Martin at trial.\n\"I'm very much looking forward to seeing this trial convey exactly who he is and have him defend his actions,\" said Matt. \"I don't think it's going to go well for him.\"\nRELATED STORIES"

            "When BTS took the stage Saturday night, it was easy to think that there should be a way to harness that much concentrated, palpable human fervor to power things, like in the Pixar film \"Monsters Inc.\" \u2014 solve the energy crisis and save the planet. It was that loud.\nAfter months of preparation, the day had finally arrived \u2014 never mind a damp morning and windy, chilly evening. No army has ever been deterred by a cloudy day and light drizzle. The BTS ARMY was no exception.\nAdvertisement\nThe record-breaking K-pop group is in Chicago for two sold-out concerts at Soldier Field over the Mother's Day weekend as part of its \"Love Yourself: Speak Yourself\" world tour. The first set to begin at \u2014 we were told \u2014 7:30 p.m., sharp.\nARMY members (Adorable Representative MC for Youth \u2014 a moniker for the group's dedicated fan base) have been preparing for weeks. By Friday, some were already in line to purchase official BTS tour merchandise outside of the stadium. Others were driving from Kentucky and Ohio; arriving on trains and planes from New York, Kentucky and Texas, even Canada and Mexico. A pop-up store on State Street (launched on May 7, closes Monday) saw 3,700 fans come through the door on Friday alone, according to staffers.\nAdvertisement\nOn Saturday morning, the Twitter hashtag #BTSXChicago was trending before 8 a.m. as fans coordinated various meet-ups, photo ops and other tailgate-like activities ahead of their idols' arrival. The line at the pop-up shop stretched from State Street to Dearborn Street, with over 1,100 folks having visited before 1 p.m. to nab Chicago-specific merchandise, and peek at the upcoming BTS doll collection.\nFans entering the two-story BTS pop-up shop at 114 S. State Street. The shop is open through May 13. (Jessi Roti / Chicago Tribune)\nThe staff at the Hyatt Regency at McCormick Place got in on the festivities \u2014 dressing in BTS gear and welcoming out-of-town concert attendees with a backdrop, featuring all seven group members' faces, to pose in front of for photos. The hotel even held a raffle that offered the chance to win a highly coveted \"ARMY Boxe.\"\nKorean restaurant Kimchi Pop in Noble Square boasted a weekend \"BTS (or Best Taste of Street) Special\" in honor of the group's visit.\nAt Buckingham Fountain a morning \"family photo shoot\" \u2013 organized by photographer Madalyn Rain, 19, of Zion \u2014 turned into much more. Over 250 fans showed up, holding down a dance circle for hours, hugging fellow \"ARMY family\" \u2014 who previously only existed online \u2014 in real life. They practiced group chants ahead of the night's main event, and gave each other gifts and other handmade accessories to sport at the concert.\nRain was shocked.\n\"I was up until 3 in the morning like 'Oh my God, is anybody gonna show up?'\" she says, smiling. \"I was not expecting this many people here, I was expecting myself and maybe two people. I'm about to cry, this hasn't even really sank in yet. I want to call my mom.\"\nThe shoot included four group photos: BTS Chicago ARMY, out-of-town ARMY, ARMY moms (in honor of Mother's Day on Sunday) and ARMY parents (with plenty of proud and equally excited dads jumping into frame).\n\"People (on Facebook) kept saying 'You know, I'm bringing my kids.' 'I want to do this because it's a great opportunity for my kids,' 'My kids are shy, they're not really comfortable, this has made them so comfortable.' So I was like, how about the moms, though?\" Rain said of recognizing the concert's holiday overlap and realizing the role that moms especially play in fostering such strong fandoms.\nAdvertisement\nThe ARMY Family, fans of K-pop group BTS, took a photo together in Chicago on Saturday, May 11, 2019. (Jessi Roti)\n\"I want the moms to not get overlooked. I've seen people come from New York, Texas, and they drove here. They drove their kids to make sure they were here and I wanted them to stand out. They deserve that.\n\"BTS fans are way more united than people think we are,\" Rain adds. \"People, they think K-pop and they're like 'Why?' BTS has a message, they're all about loving themselves and every person here just showed they care about that message. That's really what I wanted to do, make sure that message gets through. I don't know what anybody's going through and I wanted this to be something that everybody just remembers.\"\n18 year-old Princess Berry made the trip from Oklahoma alone by train, figuring (like many fans) she'd meet up with her online ARMY family once she arrived.\nAt the fountain, Berry had laid out an American flag for fellow fans to sign with well wishes and other congratulatory messages for BTS. With a seat on the main floor for Saturday's gig, she was convinced she had a shot to get the flag to them.\nFans dance to \"Mic Drop\" by BTS in Chicago on Saturday, May 11, 2019.\n\"I'm right by the side stage, so I'll find a way,\" she says. \"We've done this at other K-pop shows. I'll get it to them.\"\nAnd yet, those displays of deeply immersed, passionate commitment weren't enough to fully prepare the casual fan or intrigued observer for what happened as soon as the lights went down.\nAdvertisement\nJoined by nearly two dozen dancers on-and-off throughout the roughly two hour set, which featured 24 songs from its catalog \u2013 BTS stuck primarily to its later work on albums \"Youth,\" the compilation \"Love Yourself: Answer\" and \"Persona,\" dazzled with fashion-forward costume changes, performed on an inflatable obstacle course complete with slides and used hyper-stylized videos (we're talking luxury perfume ad-adjacent aesthetics) showcasing each member to keep the crowd engaged while stage crews set-up for the next pyrotechnic boom.\nFans pose under the 'mic drop' installation at the BTS pop-up at 114 S. State Street. (Jessi Roti / Chicago Tribune)\nTaking the stage to \"Dionysus\" from its latest album \"Map of the Soul: Persona\" closer to 7:45 p.m. (ahem), the group \u2013 clad all in coordinating, royally tattered, jewel-encrusted white outfits as life-size panthers inflated behind them \u2014 it was clear BTS was treating this tour as a victory lap. If the ear-shattering reception was of any indication, so were the fans.\nLight sticks, or \"ARMY bombs\" flickered from purple to pink, blue to green \u2013 with BTS even imploring fans to start a lit-up wave effect across the stadium.\nWhile the outfit has become synonymous with its formational choreography and \"big pop machine\" slickness, its live performance at Soldier Field felt freer; less like an act with something left to prove in the States.\nOften, the group showed its range in musical style and ability by splitting up. Playing up each man's individual personalities and strengths and with solo performances \u2014 from hip-hop influenced dance cuts courtesy of J-Hope and Suga, to titillating R&B infused numbers like \"Singularity\" (sung by V, who rose onto the stage in an oversized bed) and emotional messages of self-love (\"Epiphany,\" performed by Jin alone at the piano noticeably brought a few fans to tears) \u2013 and smaller group numbers (\"The Truth Untold\" performed only by the BTS 'balladeers' Jin, Jungkook, Jimin and V, and \"Tear\" attacked by its rappers RM, J-Hope and Suga); BTS rattled many preconceived notions around its \"cookie cutter-hybrid pop\" template.\nA first-look at the upcoming BTS doll collection by Mattel. (Jessi Roti / Chicago Tribune)\nSinger Jungkook took his lone rendition of \"Euphoria\" to new heights, actually soaring above the crowd before rejoining his mates for the chart-topping \"Boy With Luv,\" \"Fire\" and \"IDOL.\"\nAdvertisement\nThe group thanked fans for 15 minutes before capping its three-song encore with the exuberant \"Mikrokosmos\" \u2014 cementing the fact that BTS would not exist without ARMY. Each member addressed the audience, a few using a translator, to express their gratitude.\nIt went without saying that the feeling was mutual.\n\"As a mom, you don't get these moments that often,\" said Tam O'Connell of Aurora, who's attending both nights with her daughter, Cai\n\"Cai's the only daughter in town, but to really be able to go to this concert and be joyful and excited and spend time with my baby and all of the other moms and other ARMY. Online, there are so many ARMYs that reached out \u2026 I'm overwhelmed,\" O'Connell says, visibly moved by the community and music she feels accepts her as equally as it accepts her daughter.\n\"What touched my heart (about BTS) was they wanted to include everyone. I'm a mom, I'm black, my husband's white, my son suffers with mental illness, I have a daughter \u2014 she's gay and she's beautiful,\" she adds. \"When BTS stepped up to the plate and said 'love yourself, love everything about yourself, be out and be proud' \u2014 that got me. I love the feeling and I'm gonna treasure that, so I'm so glad that I could do it with my daughter and have these moments.\"\njroti@chicagotribune.com\nAdvertisement\nTwitter @jessitaylorro\nMORE COVERAGE: A guide to K-pop's cultural influence in Chicago before BTS arrives for two sold-out concerts at Soldier Field \u00bb\nThe 1975 review: Matty Healy eclipses his own band at the United Center \u00bb\nWax Trax!

            "The state of Iowa has joined the ranks of states to legalize sports betting.\nOn Monday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds put her signature on a sports betting bill that cleared the legislature last month. Reynolds took about a week to sign the bill after it was delivered to her desk on May 6.\nThe new law authorizes sports betting for the state\u2019s 19 casinos. The plan is to have brick-and-mortar sports wagering by the upcoming NFL season, with mobile to follow sometime after the retail books open. Iowa will allow statewide online/mobile betting, but there is an in-person registration requirement that won\u2019t sunset until Jan. 1, 2021.\nIowa considered sports betting in 2018, and there were several bills on the table this year. As opposed to going with regulation under the lottery, Iowa went with with its Racing and Gaming Commission.\nIowa, a relatively small state with just 3.1 mm people, is projected to eventually have more than $4 billion in annual sports wagers. Iowa\u2019s market might be small compared to the likes of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, but it should benefit from being able to capitalize on a lack of legal sports betting in Nebraska and Minnesota.\nNebaskans already spend more than $300 mm each year at Iowa casinos.\nIowa could use sports betting as much as any other gaming. Commercial casino revenue was up more than 3% nationwide in 2018, but for Iowa gaming win ($1.46 billion) was up a mere 0.3% over 2017, according to state data.\nIowa latest in 2019 to legalize\nReynolds\u2019 signature comes nearly one year to the day after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a federal sports wagering ban called the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992.\nOther states to legalize sports betting this year include Montana, Indiana, and Tennessee.\nThere are now more than 10 states with legal sports wagering, made possible by the Supreme Court ruling.\nThere was some concern that Reynolds might not sign the measure, given the opposition to the bill. She ultimately signed, like governors in Montana and Indiana. Tennessee\u2019s governor will let his state\u2019s bill become law without a signature.\nPrior to last summer, Nevada was the only state in the country with traditional sports wagering.\nHighlights of Iowa\u2019s sports betting bill"

            "Published 05/16/2019, 5:08 PM EDT\nAfter a rainy day in Rome, the play in the Italian city resumed with incessant tennis action on all courts of Foro Italico. Most of the ATP and WTA players played two matches today and compensated for yesterday\u2019s prolonged wait to hit the tennis courts. The Austrian, Dominic Thiem lost 6-4, 4-6, 5-7 to the Spaniard, Fernando Verdasco.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nThe NextGen clay-courter, Thiem was to have expected a deep run at the Italian Open 2019 and he was drawn in the same half as Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. In Madrid last week, he played a thespian match against the Swiss World Number three, where he faced two match points and later pulled off the rabbit out of the hat.\nDominic Thiem\nAfter his second round exit, World NUmber four, Dominic Thiem fumed at the Rome Masters organizers. Despite being aware of the weather conditions of the city yesterday all the players were asked to come for their matches to their respective courts and they had to wait all day because of the rain.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\u201cI don\u2019t like anything how we\u2019ve been treated players in this tournament,\u201d Dominic Thiem ranted. \u201cYesterday was not acceptable.

I could not get treatment because if not, I would not have been able to sleep and they put me to play today at 10 am. It\u2019s unacceptable. I\u2019m very angry\u201d, Dominic Thiem added.\nDominic Thiem\nOn the other ATP courts, the \u2018Big Three\u2019 of tennis move into the quarterfinals of the Italian Open 2019.

        "articles": [
            "It might be the biggest price-fixing scheme in U.S. history. On Friday, Connecticut and a coalition of more than 40 states filed a 500-page lawsuit accusing the biggest generic drug makers of a massive, systematic conspiracy to bilk consumers out of billions of dollars. It's a more sweeping version of a similar lawsuit the states filed in 2016 that's still being litigated. The generic industry vehemently denies the allegations.\nCongress established the current generic industry in 1984 to push prices down. The idea was that once patents on brand name drugs expired, generic makers would compete to make drugs more affordable. But 1,215 generics, many of them the most prescribed drugs, jumped on average more than 400 percent in a single year.\nConnecticut has been examining the generic drug industry for almost five years. Tonight, we'll take you inside its investigation and show you how two dogged attorneys built the cases the state attorney general calls the most egregious examples of corporate greed he has ever seen.\nWilliam Tong\nWilliam Tong: It's an industry-wide conspiracy. And I think it answers one of the biggest questions all of us are asking, which is why are prescription drugs so expensive? And I think we know why now. Because the prices of generic drugs are fixed. And there's a widespread conspiracy to rig the market.\nConnecticut Attorney General William Tong says his office found evidence of price fixing by dozens of generic drug industry sales directors, marketers, CEOs dating back to 2006.\nBill Whitaker: How many drugs are we talking about?\nWilliam Tong: Hundreds. Hundreds of drugs.\nBill Whitaker: What kinds of drugs?\nWilliam Tong: Every kind of drug that touches our everyday lives. I'll give you an example, Bill. This is my bottle of doxycycline. It is a common antibiotic that I take every day for a skin condition. And there is a conspiracy around doxycycline. And so sitting here today as the attorney general of the state of Connecticut, I'm one of the victims.\nBetween 2013 and 2014, a bottle of doxycycline shot up 8,281 percent from $20 to more than $1800. A bottle of asthma medication, albuterol sulfate, jumped more than 4000 percent, from $11 to $434. Pravastatin, a cholesterol drug, up more than 500 percent, from $27 a bottle to $196.\nThe sudden price spikes caught the attention of Congress, which called a hearing; the Department of Justice, which launched an investigation; and the state of Connecticut, which now has filed two lawsuits.\nWilliam Tong: This is a phased approach And we're focusing on all the major players.\nBill Whitaker: So is it your contention that these companies are putting Americans' lives at risk?\nWilliam Tong: Yes, you know, it's $100 billion market. We're talking about the drugs that America takes every day to live. And they're profiteering off of that in a highly illegal way. They're just taking advantage.\nBill Whitaker: The industry says that the prices went up because of market forces and because of drug shortages. These explanations don't wash with you?\nWilliam Tong: No. I mean they've said this to me to my face. And\u2014\nBill Whitaker: Why don't you believe that?\nWilliam Tong: Because we have evidence, hard evidence, in the form of text messages, emails, documents, witnesses that demonstrate clearly that it wasn't about product shortages. It was about profit. It was about cold, hard greed.\nCorrespondent Bill Whitaker with Joe Nielsen and Mike Cole\nHow can he say that? Because of what these two sleuth attorneys uncovered. Mike Cole heads the antitrust division in the Connecticut Attorney General's office. Joe Nielsen is his lead prosecutor on this case. They've worked together for more than a decade reaching multi-million dollar settlements with big names like Apple and Bank of America. This, they say, is their biggest case yet.\nMichael Cole: This particular industry \u2014 the generic drug industry \u2014 touches everybody.\nJoe Nielsen: 90 percent of all prescriptions filled in this country are filled with generic drugs.\nIn the summer of 2014, Cole and Nielsen spotted a newspaper article about a sharp rise in the price of a decades-old generic heart medication called digoxin.\nBill Whitaker: So you read the article and something just didn't smell right?\nMichael Cole: I guess you could say you get a little bit of a sixth sense after you do this type of work for a long period of time which we both have. So we did a little bit more due diligence. And we sent out three subpoenas.\nBill Whitaker: What did you think you would find?\nMichael Cole: We were looking for communications amongst competitors. When you do this kind of work it's really not one hot document, as they say, that's gonna prove a case. It's kind of like putting together a puzzle, a piece at a time.\nThe puzzle grew into a monster. Three subpoenas turned into more than 300 to major generic drug companies, dozens of employees and phone companies. Over the course of the investigation, the subpoenas generated almost 19 million internal documents and phone records. There were so many pieces, Joe Nielsen couldn't make out the big picture at first. For more than two years, he was the only one working the case. He spent days at his office desk and many nights at his dining room table looking for patterns. He eventually bought software used by law enforcement to investigate drug cartels, so he could analyze nearly 12 million phone logs.\nBill Whitaker: And this allowed you to do what?\nJoe Nielsen: Well, this allows you within five minutes to look at someone's entire phone records and see the history of who they communicated with, when.\nNielsen saw a picture emerge of a cozy relationship among industry competitors with lots of phone chatter right before they increased prices apparently in lock step.\nJoe Nielsen: You know, we can see that competitor A is talking to competitor B five times on one day. And what that allows us to do is to go into our document database and look on that day at what they were saying.\nIt all snapped into sharp focus when he matched phone logs to thousands of text messages from Heritage Pharmaceuticals. Nielsen says this exchange, with competitor Citron Pharma, showed collusion to increase the price of a diabetes medication. The text messages implicate two other companies: Aurobindo and Teva, the world's largest generic drug maker. The national accounts manager at Heritage wrote:\nA.S.: \"We are raising the price right now \u2014 just letting you know, Teva says they will follow\"\nA.S.: \"Aurobindo agrees too\"\nA corporate account representative from Citron answered:\nKA: \"...we are def [initely] in to raise pricing ... are doing this immediately\"\nThe Heritage executive responded:\nAS: \"We are raising our customers 200% over current market price.\"\nBill Whitaker: So what's wrong with these companies talking to each other?\nJoe Nielsen: If they were talking about\u2014 their families or, you know, a barbecue that they went to, there would be nothing wrong with it. But when they talk about raising prices and they agree to do that then it's completely and totally illegal.\nTake the case of the antifungal drug Nystatin. As you can see with this graph, the price held steady at $68 a bottle for years, but in April 2013 Sun Pharmaceuticals almost doubled the price to $131. Right after the increase there was this flurry of phone calls between Sun and competitors, Heritage and Teva.\nJoe Nielsen: So you see a phone call between Heritage and Sun pharmaceuticals lasting over 45 minutes.\nAfter dozens of calls like this, first Teva, then Heritage followed Sun's lead and jacked up the price of Nystatin to $142 a bottle. Joe Nielsen also found messages that seemed to show companies, including Pfizer, conspiring to divvy up the market for other drugs. The lawsuit filed Friday states: \"Pfizer, acting through its wholly-owned subsidiary and alter ego... Greenstone, entered into agreements with Teva and... other competitors to allocate and divide customers and markets... and to fix and raise prices.\" It refers to this email from Teva as evidence.\n\"[T]ell Greenstone we are playing nice in the sandbox and we will let them have [the \u2026 customer].\"\nBill Whitaker: Play nice in the sandbox. What does that mean?\nJoe Nielsen: Avoid competing with each other, take your fair share and don't go after anything more than that. Keep the prices as high as you can.\nBill Whitaker: But I thought the whole point of generic drugs was to have competition and keep the price down?\nJoe Nielsen: That's the point for us, but that's what the companies who are selling the generic drugs want to avoid.\nWilliam Tong: I think what we've come upon is that the generic drug industry is the largest private sector corporate cartel in history.\nBill Whitaker: What is the effect of that on you? Me? Average consumer?\nWilliam Tong: It's devastating. it affects health insurance premiums and health insurance plans. It impacts Medicare and Medicaid. And it is a chain reaction that drives up the price of American healthcare to unnatural heights.\nWe reached out to the companies mentioned in our report for comment. Pfizer, which advertises on this broadcast, denies any wrongdoing and says it has cooperated with the Connecticut Attorney General. It says its subsidiary, Greenstone, intends to vigorously fight the claims. Sun issued this statement: \"Sun Pharma is committed to the highest level of ethics and integrity... We believe the allegations made in these lawsuits are without merit and we will continue to vigorously defend against them.\"\nIn court filings Sun and other drug makers have argued there's no proof of an overarching conspiracy. The industry trade group told us generic prices declined three straight years from 2016.\nWilliam Tong: There has been some leveling off. But I don't think that means that the conspiracy has ended. They're still unnaturally high. What we haven't seen is if they stopped colluding you would expect prices to go down dramatically. You would expect competition to ensue and one competitor would go after another. And they'd start undercutting each other on price. That hasn't happened.\nDr. Thomas Pliura\nBill Whitaker: Are you seeing patients today?\nDr. Thomas Pliura: I am.\nDr. Tom Pliura is feeling the impact of rising generic drug prices. He runs a clinic that serves 14,000 people in rural, southern Illinois. This is a federally designated, \"health care shortage area,\" which is a bureaucratic way of saying there aren't enough doctors around here.\nThree quarters of his patients are on Medicare or Medicaid. Both government programs set limits on reimbursements for drugs. The rising generic prices have created a medical emergency for him. Since the government won't cover the increased costs, his patients or his clinic must.\nDr. Thomas Pliura: We've been able to\u2014 to keep the doors open. But it's getting harder and harder. And with these tremendous\u2014 spikes\u2014 it's a problem.\nBill Whitaker: The impact of the rising prices is so great that it might put you out of business?\nDr. Thomas Pliura: No question about it. We've had that discussion right here in this building.\nHe worries his patients will suffer. So, Dr. Pliura has joined unions, pharmacies, school employees and other plaintiffs that have filed dozens of class action lawsuits in the wake of Connecticut's investigation, all accusing generic drug makers of fixing prices.\nBill Whitaker: That's a big fight for a small clinic in rural Illinois to pick.\nDr. Thomas Pliura: I think somebody has to raise their hand. Somebody has to say, \"You know\u2014 it's wrong, what's going on.\" you can't put people in a position where they're forced to either pay their rent or buy food and forego their medication.\" And that's what's \u2014 that's what's happening all over the U.S.\nWilliam Tong: As an attorney general, I look at that and I say, \"How can they do that?\" And I think what we've concluded is they know it's illegal. And\u2014 and it's not that they're too big to fail. It's that they're just too big to care.\nBill Whitaker: That sounds harsh. Too big to care.\nWilliam Tong: That's the only conclusion I think anyone can draw when they see this evidence. And so then you start wondering why would they do this? Because there's just too much money to be made.\nConnecticut Attorney General Tong told us he and the other state attorneys general are continuing to investigate the generic drug industry and plan to file more lawsuits.\nWilliam Tong: This conspiracy has caused billions and billions of dollars in damages to the people of Connecticut and states across the country. And we're gonna take them on in court and hold them accountable. And they're gonna pay for the money they stole from the American people.\nProduced by Marc Lieberman and Ali Rawaf.

            "The Warriors just punched their ticket to the Western Conference finals for the fifth consecutive season.\nAnd, more good news came shortly after Golden State's 4-2 series win over Houston. Center DeMarcus Cousins could return during the series.\nAccording to a New York Times report, which cited unidentified league sources, if Cousins continues his recent progress recovering from a torn quad, he could return to the team's active roster.\nAnother reward for the victorious Warriors: League sources say that DeMarcus Cousins -- if he maintains his recent progress from a torn quad -- is on course to make a return to the Warriors' active roster during the Western Conference finals \u2014 Marc Stein (@TheSteinLine) May 11, 2019\nThe report also noted Golden State would be at full strength with the potential return of both Cousins and Kevin Durant, who suffered a strained calf in Game 5 and wasn't able to play in Game 6.\nWinning this game tonight, in other words, not only kept alive Golden State's dynasty but could also see the Warriors return to full strength in the next round should both Cousins and Kevin Durant return from injury \u2014 Marc Stein (@TheSteinLine) May 11, 2019\nCousins has been nursing a torn left quadriceps muscle, which he suffered in the Warriors' first-round series against the Clippers. He began his rehab program earlier this month.\n\"For me, my goal is I ain't planning on sitting,\" Cousins recently told ESPN's The Undefeated. \"I don't know the reality of it. But for me, that is not what I'm planning on doing. ... It's definitely some type of bad movie. But I think it will have a very nice ending. Just wait for it.\n\"Obviously, I was little more relieved that it wasn't anything catastrophic like I've dealt with before. It sucks to be injured anyway on top of that. The timing of it really (messed) me up the most. It's a part of this game, man. I'm not the first. I won't be the last.\"\nCousins finished the regular season averaging 16.3 points and 8.2 rebounds in 25.7 minutes per game. He suffered the injury when he fell chasing a loose ball on a fast break in the first quarter of Golden State's Game 2 matchup with Los Angeles.\nCoach Steve Kerr has been hopeful Cousins could return if the team makes another deep playoff run, which it is poised to do. Kerr said earlier this month, \"There's a good chance the big man will be able to return as the Warriors make a run at another championship.\""

More info\nManchester City became the first team to retain the Premier League crown since 2009 by beating Brighton 4-1 on Sunday afternoon, thanks to goals from Sergio Aguero, Aymeric Laporte, Riyad Mahrez and Raheem Sterling. Once Mahrez\u2019s splendid effort, which made the score 3-1, rippled the back of the net, City players, management and fans celebrated knowing the title was staying at the Etihad Stadium. Gundogan\u2019s terrific fourth, a whipped free-kick, turned the final 20 minutes into a procession, during which the away end at the Amex sang loudly and proudly. In that cohort of City fans was life-long Sky Blue Gallagher, who famously follows the team.\nWhen the full-time whistle blew, the pitch became a dance floor for City as all members of the club hugged and congratulated each other on a splendid campaign, in which they tallied 98 points. After changing into a uniformed City strip and returning to the pitch to lift the trophy in front of their fans, City retired to the dressing room to continue celebrations. Gallagher made his way into the facility and found himself serenaded by his favourite players, who belted Oasis\u2019 most famous hit \u2018Wonderwall\u2019, which has become an anthem for the team over the last two seasons. Gallagher, in the corner with his unbuttoned shirt and sunglasses, stood with his arms aloft as the squad sang the often-recited chorus, pointing and filming the Mancunian.\nMan City celebrated the Premier League title win with former Oasis frontman Noel Gallagher\nMan City fan Noel Gallagher belts out Oasis' 'Wonderwall' in the dressing room\nIt's the toughest title we have won in all my career, by far. Pep Guardiola\nFWA Footballer of the Year and PFA Young Player of the Year Raheem Sterling was key to City\u2019s title charge, scoring 17 goals and registering 10 assists. Amid the celebrations, the England international found poise to summarise the achievement of his side: \u201cI'm just delighted, this is exactly what I came to the club for, to win trophies and be in these moments. \"The manager here\u2026 his mentality is the best. It's always about winning. It's the way he sets us up. I'm happy to be here learning and winning. \"As a manager, he's got multiple players in each position challenging each other. No one is comfortable here but everyone is ready to take their chance - like Riyad today.\nMan City fan Noel Gallagher sings along with the Premier League champions\n\u201cHe's not played much recently but I knew he was going to score today. It's been a lovely season after a difficult World Cup. Hopefully I can go one better next year.\" Pep Guardiola claimed this title triumph eclipses last season\u2019s 100-point campaign, and said: \u201cWe have to say congratulations to Liverpool and thank you so much, they pushed us to increase our standards. \"It's incredible, 98 points, to go back-to-back. We made the standard higher last season and Liverpool helped us. \u201cTo win this title we had to win 14 (league games) in a row. We couldn't lose one point. It's the toughest title we have won in all my career, by far.\"\nMan City captain Vincent Kompany poses with the Premier League trophy and Noel Gallagher\nTrending\nMan City players knew they had the title won when Riyad Mahrez bagged the third goal vs Brighton\nCity fans sang long into the night but were initially biting their nails when Glenn Murray headed Brighton in front in the 27th minute, while Liverpool took the lead against Wolves. Aguero settled those nerves one minute later, however, after being slipped through one-on-one with Maty Ryan and tucking the ball under the Australian. Laporte then headed City ahead shortly before half-time, charging onto a corner and heading home.\nMan City captain Vincent Kompany lifts his fourth Premier League title"

Now \u2014 onto the next!\nHBO dropped the trailer for the final episode of season 8 \u2014 also the series finale \u2014 at the end of Sunday\u2019s penultimate episode, titled \u201cThe Bells.\u201d\nIn what is possibly the shortest preview so far, Tyrion walks through a ruined King\u2019s Landing while fires smolder nearby and ash falls like snow. Arya approaches a crowd of soldiers who appear to be gathered around something, a group of Dothraki raise their scimitars and whoop in approval, and Daenerys looks over what\u2019s left of her new kingdom with the Unsullied arrayed before her.\nNotably, those who remained in the North were absent from the trailer. But, with so many King\u2019s Landing players out for the count \u2014 and it being the last episode ever \u2014 Sansa and Bran are sure to make a reappearance.\nEpisode 4 saw the fulfillment of the mad queen plotline that some fans hoped wouldn\u2019t be put into play, but alas. After the Lannister army surrendered, Daenerys burnt King\u2019s Landing and likely the vast majority of its innocent inhabitants to bits. Now, the remaining players are left to determine who will sit on the Iron Throne.\nWatch the trailer below.\n\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO.\nRELATED:"

            "The top-seeded Golden State Warriors and third-seeded Portland Trail Blazers disposed of the Houston Rockets and Denver Nuggets in six and seven games, respectively. The two teams will meet for a third time in four years. Golden State beat Portland in a 2017 first-round sweep and a 2016 second-round, five-game set.\nHow they got here\nGolden State: In their quest for a third straight title and fourth in five years, the Warriors lost DeMarcus Cousins to a torn left quad in Game 2 of the first round and Kevin Durant to a right calf strain in Game 5 of the second round. Yet, here we are, with Golden State installed as heavy favorites to beat Portland and become the first team since the Boston Celtics of the 1950s and \u201860s to reach five straight Finals.\nCousins, somehow, is \u201con course\u201d to return during the Western Conference finals, and Durant is scheduled to be re-evaluated this week, when we should know if and when he can play in this series. So, after all the hullabaloo over Durant\u2019s impending free agency and Cousins\u2019 decision to join a team already stacked with four All-Star starters, we are likely left with the Warriors of old for at least the start of this series.\nAre they still good enough with merely three All-NBA talents? They looked the part on Friday, when Splash Brothers Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson combined for 60 points in a close-out win in Houston. The \u201cStrength in Numbers\u201d Warriors were back, with Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston and a cast of late draft picks filling roles around Curry, Thompson and Draymond Green. Andrew Bogut was there, too.\nThere is still some suspense, and that is a good thing. Curry and Thompson both battled cold streaks through two rounds, and Golden State\u2019s depth remains a question, even as 35-year-old Iguodala turns back the clock and backup center Kevon Looney emerges as a real threat. There are concerns about Bogut, Quinn Cook, Alfonzo McKinnie and Jordan Bell, all of whom were called upon in Houston, and Livingston had been largely ineffective until Game 6. If you\u2019re calling for more frontcourt minutes from Jonas Jerebko, you know you\u2019re not completely at ease.\nStory continues\nIf Durant returns by the time this series moves to Portland and is any semblance of himself, that\u2019s a different story. Even as the Warriors went longer than expected in their first-round series with the Los Angeles Clippers and were deadlocked entering Game 5 against the Rockets, the outcomes never really felt in doubt, because Durant was the best player in all the playoffs and nobody had an answer for him.\nStephen Curry has historically been a step ahead of Damian Lillard in the NBA's point guard hierarchy. (Getty Images)\nPortland: How the Blazers got here is a hero\u2019s journey. They were swept from the first round by the New Orleans Pelicans in last year\u2019s playoffs, and the NBA intelligentsia largely left them for dead. But Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum apparently do not die. They somehow never stop coming back stronger and better.\nLillard took out the Oklahoma City Thunder in Round 1 with one of the greatest close-out game performances in NBA history, and McCollum ousted the Denver Nuggets in Round 2 with an almost equally dramatic Game 7 performance. Both were marked by signature moments \u2014 Dame\u2019s 37-foot game-winner and CJ\u2019s late chase-down block \u2014 that finally pounded into our brains: Yes, you can win with two 6-foot-3 playmaking guards leading the way, or at least with these two.\nThe Blazers were written off once center Jusuf Nurkic snapped his leg in two at the end of March, but the resilience of Enes Kanter and emergence of Zach Collins helped Portland answer some questions about whether they can win without him. That they have done so despite more inconsistent play from stalwart swingmen Al-Farouq Aminu and Mo Harkless is further testament to Lillard and McCollum.\nPortland\u2019s backcourt is averaging 54 points on 44/39/80 shooting splits, along with 10.6 rebounds and 9.4 assists per game in the playoffs. You don\u2019t need much help when they\u2019re giving you that kind of production, and they\u2019ve gotten more than they bargained for from midseason additions Kanter and Rodney Hood (who enter this series battling shoulder and knee injuries suffered against Denver, respectively).\nMostly, though, Portland has gotten through by playing smart and hard and together. They rarely give away extra possessions and work to get more, playing with the import of a team marked by stability and a sense that everyone knows his place in the hierarchy. Whether that matters against a team that has proven time and again to be more talented, with or without Durant, we are about to find out.\nHead to head\nSince we aren\u2019t clear whether Durant will be available and for how long, since Nurkic was really good against the Warriors, and since neither Curry nor Green played in a game Golden State won by 28, it\u2019s hard to draw many conclusions about the first season series split of the Steve Kerr era between the two teams.\nYet, it does feel like there is something to the Blazers winning in Oracle Arena for the first time since November 2013 \u2014 on another Lillard game-winner with 6.3 seconds left, no less \u2014 and then blowing the Warriors out at home in their most recent meeting. Both of those games featured the full Cousins-less contingent of Golden State stars, with Looney playing center, and that has to give Portland even more confidence than they already exude, especially if Durant remains sidelined.\nDurant was remarkable \u2014 and remarkably consistent \u2014 against the Blazers, averaging 28.8 points (on 57.5/41.2/76.2 shooting splits), 6.3 rebounds, 6.3 assists and three combined blocks and steals over the four meetings. Likewise, Nurkic was really impressive against the Warriors this year, averaging 20.3 points, 10 rebounds and 3.3 assists in the four games. Both of their absences impact the apexes of the two teams in different ways, but neither is unaccustomed to playing without them.\nMcCollum was fairly inefficient in all four games against Golden State during the regular season, averaging 18 points on 18 shots and shooting a combined 11 of 40 (3 for 18 from 3-point range) when guarded by Curry, Thompson or Iguodala. Lillard wasn\u2019t so efficient, either \u2014 until he hit the game-winner in their second meeting, and then he finished with 69 points on 23-of-38 shooting (12 of 21 from 3-point range) and 13 assists over the final two meetings. They both need to be great to win this series.\nCurry and Thompson were themselves against the Blazers, save for a 2-for-16 stinker from Klay in the blowout loss on Feb. 13. Green is a wildcard, as always. He was mostly ordinary against the Blazers during the regular season, as he was against everyone, but he has been great in the playoffs. His ability to make shots and then hold up against Kanter\u2019s relentless offensive rebounding will go a long way in determining how often Golden State can play its vaunted small-ball lineups.\nLikely starting lineups\nWith Durant out for Game 1 and unlikely for Game 2, the Warriors will likely stick with the same starting lineup that finished the Houston series: Curry, Thompson, Iguodala, Green and Bogut. Durant and Cousins will probably supplant Iguodala and Bogut if they return, although Kerr may also consider starting Looney at center.\nGolden State\u2019s best non-Durant lineups in the playoffs have both featured Looney. And while even the lineup of Curry, Thompson, Durant and Green with Looney finished a net negative against Portland during the regular season, that was before Nurkic went down. It will be interesting to see if Kanter can make Looney pay in the same way, or if Looney\u2019s athleticism can help the Warriors run Kanter off the floor.\nOtherwise, how much Bogut do we see in this series? Can he match Kanter\u2019s effort at age 34? Or is Green their best option against stronger centers? Will the Blazers counter with Collins and open themselves up to Golden State\u2019s more versatile lineups? The return of Cousins could throw another wrench into this mix. How Kerr and Portland coach Terry Stotts manage the matchups at center will be one of the few variables to watch, because there aren\u2019t many adjustments in the backcourt, where Curry, Thompson, Lillard and McCollum will throw haymakers at each other.\nThe Blazers have stuck with the same starting lineup throughout the playoffs: Lillard, McCollum, Harkless, Aminu and Kanter. That group did not face Golden State together this season, since Portland signed Kanter on the day of their last meeting. They are also a minus-39 in 226 minutes as a unit in 12 playoff games.\nAll three of Portland\u2019s most-used playoff lineups have been outscored. They have found success with Hood (who is day-to-day with a hyperextended left knee) and Collins. Evan Turner and Seth Curry have had nice stretches, too. Regardless of the machinations around Lillard and McCollum, though, the fact of the matter is that the Blazers are plus-29 with them on the court together in the playoffs. Unfortunately, those two were also a minus-24 together against the Warriors in the regular season.\nKevin Durant has been ruled out for Game 1 and unlikely for Game 2. (Getty Images)\nMatchups to watch\nLillard vs. Curry: There will be some cross-switching going on here. Lillard will defend Curry, but the Warriors usually throw Thompson on Lillard and leave Steph to chase McCollum. But that\u2019s neither here nor there. Given their size and scoring ability, Lillard and Curry are the two most electrifying players on the planet. They can ignite their respective home crowds like nobody else, and it will be a delight to watch them try to torch each other on this stage. For the record, Curry scored 38 points on 26 shots in 97 possessions over three games with Lillard as his primary defender this season. Lillard scored 26 points on 27 shots in 138 possessions opposite Thompson (and 12 points on five shots in 12 possessions against Curry).\nMcCollum vs. Jennifer: When Durant joined McCollum\u2019s podcast this past summer, they had a debate about Cousins joining the Warriors. KD told McCollum, \u201cYou know you guys aren\u2019t going to win a championship,\u201d adding that the Blazers guard was crazy to think making playoffs made him a winner. McCollum took issue and later called Durant\u2019s and Cousins\u2019 ring-chasing \u201cdisgusting.\u201d A Twitter user responded, \u201cWin a playoff game then talk,\u201d to which McCollum now famously said, \u201cI\u2019m trying Jennifer.\u201d This has become a rallying cry for him during a spectacular playoff run, and now he and his Blazers have their shot to prove Durant wrong.\nGreen vs. Portland\u2019s bigs: The Warriors were plus-23 in 107 minutes against the Blazers with Green on the court and minus-8 in 90 minutes without him. They were minus-17 in 98 minutes with Looney on the floor against Portland and plus-32 in 99 minutes without him. Given Cousins\u2019 absence and Bogut\u2019s age, Green could draw a heavier load at the center position, where he held Kanter and Collins to a combined four points on 14 shots over 61 possessions in one-on-one matchups this season. The death lineup \u2014 with Green manning the middle \u2014 has long been Golden State\u2019s greatest weapon, but can it still be without Durant helping to protect the rim? Green is a weapon the Blazers can\u2019t really match, but he has to be sharp.\nHow Golden State can win\nThere are many ways the Warriors can win. If Durant ever returns healthy, I think he\u2019s right: The Blazers have no chance. Even without KD, if Curry and Thompson outscore Lillard and McCollum, Golden State is in great shape. In the first two years of the Kerr era, the Warriors were 11-2 against the Blazers without Durant, including 4-1 in the playoffs. Entering this season, they were 10-1 (4-0 in the playoffs) against Portland after acquiring KD. Despite the split series during this regular season, it\u2019s hard to ignore that track record, no matter how much the improvement of Portland\u2019s backcourt and the age of Golden State\u2019s supporting cast has closed the gap.\nHow Portland can win\nLillard and McCollum get hot. Curry and Thompson go cold. Kanter and Collins play plus minutes against Golden State\u2019s bigs. Durant never returns. Portland\u2019s swingmen \u2014 Harkless, Aminu, Hood and Turner \u2014 outwork their too-old or too-young counterparts on the Warriors. And we get a Seth Curry game. Little brothers everywhere need to see Seth take it to Steph\u2019s super-team at least once. This all sounds like a lot, but you don\u2019t take down the two-time defending champs easily.\nPrediction: Warriors in seven. Six if Durant gets healthy.\nEastern Conference finals preview: Milwaukee Bucks vs. Toronto Raptors\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nBen Rohrbach is a staff writer for Yahoo Sports.

And what a battle it will be. Each squad is led by top-five players in the world in Kawhi Leonard and Giannis Antetokounmpo and flanked by a parade of supporting characters that people wouldn\u2019t deem superstars.\nIn fact, the similarities are pretty interesting when you dive deep into it, considering the large majority of their rosters is comprised of late picks or guys coming in off the scrap heap. We\u2019ll have plenty to say about this series in the run-up to Wednesday, but for now, let\u2019s run through when we\u2019ll be able to tune in.

Paramount provided no comment to our queries.\nI\u2019m not going to sing on the beach, after that I can not speak for Sir Elton John,\u201d to which the show\u2019s host\nYann Barth\u00e8s concluded \u201cOk, so there will be a concert of Elton John in Cannes.\u201d\nTwo days ago, Egerton appeared on the French talk program Quotidien in which he was asked whether there would be a live performance on the beach after the premiere. The actor confirmed John\u2019s attendance at the Cannes launch but with raised eyebrows and a smile seemingly poured water on the duet idea, \u201c\nEgerton stars (and provides vocals) as John in the musical film about the singer\u2019s formative years. Cast also includes Richard Madden, Bryce Dallas Howard, Jamie Bell as Bernie Taupin, Harriet Walter, Tate Donovan and Stephen Graham.\nDuring TIFF last fall, hopes were high that Lady Gaga would perform at the afterparty for the North American premiere of A Star Is Born. That didn\u2019t happen despite the fact the afterparty was held at a venue with a stage."

European football\u2019s governing body has been collecting information on this matter for several months, and it is believed a verdict could be reached this week.\nThe information gathered includes a series of articles published by Der Spiegel in November 2018. Upon UEFA\u2019s review, it is expected the investigatory committee of the Club Financial Control Body will recommend Manchester City be barred from UEFA Champions League contention for at least one season. Should the Sky Blues be found guilty, however, it is unclear when the ban would be implemented.\nCity were previously found guilty of violating FFP in 2014, where they paid a financial fine. Moreover, they competed in the 2014/15 Champions League with a reduced squad.\nFIFA, the EPL and the English Football Association are conducting their own investigations into this matter.\nAs expected, the Sky Blues have adamantly denied breaching regulations surrounding FFP. In their club statement, the Mancunians stated they are fully cooperating with the investigation and that the \u201caccusation of financial irregularities are entirely false.\u201d Moreover, City claim \u201cindividuals intent on damaging the club\u2019s reputation\u201d may be the cause of the recent publication in the New York Times.\nShould they be found guilty, the Sky Blues would appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

The maneuver came after national security adviser John Bolton said the U.S. was sending the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and a bomber task force to the U.S. Central Command region, which includes the Middle East.\nIRANIAN CLERIC THREATENS U.S. NAVY FLEET AMID WARNING REGIME COULD TARGET COMMERCIAL SHIPS\n\u201cAn aircraft carrier that has at least 40 to 50 planes on it and 6,000 forces gathered within it was a serious threat for us in the past but now it is a target and the threats have switched to opportunities,\u201d said Amirali Hajizadeh, the head of the IRG\u2019s aerospace division, according to Iranian media.\nHaijizadeh added: \u201cIf [the Americans] make a move, we will hit them in the head.\u201d\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNBC the move to deploy a U.S. military team in the Gulf came in response to intelligence reports about possible Iranian attacks.\n\u201cWe've seen this reporting,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cIt's real. It appears to be something that is current, that is things we're worried about today.\u201d\nPompeo added: \u201cIn the event that Iran decided to come after an American interest - whether that be in Iraq or Afghanistan or Yemen or any place in the Middle East - we are prepared to respond in an appropriate way \u2026 our aim is not war.\u201d\nIranian naval commander Rear Admiral Hossien Khanzadi demanded the U.S. leave the region, Reuters reported, citing the Iranian media.\nAn Iranian cleric warned last week that Iran could easily destroy a U.S. naval fleet.\n\u201cTheir billion[-dollar] fleet can be destroyed with one missile,\" Ayatollah Tabatabai-Nejad said.\n\u201cIf they attempt any move, they will ... [face] dozens of missiles because at that time [government] officials won't be in charge to act cautiously, but instead things will be in the hands of [Ayatollah Ali Khamenei],\u201d he warned.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe heated rhetoric has capped a multiyear standoff over the rogue nation's nuclear program. President Trump's administration angered the regime when he withdrew from an Obama-era nuclear deal granting Iran sanctions relief in exchange for limited monitoring accommodations.\nFox News\u2019 Sam Dorman and Elizabeth Zwirz contributed to this report."

            "The ancient trees are a piece of a flawless biological system that traverses the greater part of the 65-mile length of the Black River. In addition to their age, these trees are logically profitable methods for recreating ancient atmospheric conditions. The most established trees in the preserve expand the paleoclimate record in the southeast United States by 900 years and show proof of dry seasons and flooding during colonial and pre-pilgrim times that surpass any measured in modern times.\nNow, scientists have recently documented stand of bald cypress trees in North Carolina which are almost 2,624 years old. As scientists reported, they are the oldest known living trees in eastern North America and the oldest known wetland tree species in the world.\nIn 2017, a David Stahle, Distinguished Professor of Geosciences, with his colleagues from the university\u2019s Ancient Bald Cypress Consortium and other conservation groups, discovered that the trees from a forested wetland preserved along the Black River south of Raleigh, North Carolina. Stahle documented the age of the trees using dendrochronology, the study of tree rings, and radio carbon dating.\nScientists examined around 110 trees located in a 16,000-acre plot of land owned by the North Carolina Nature Conservancy. The Bald Cypress trees are located along the Black River.\nStahle noted, \u201cIt is exceedingly unusual to see an old-growth stand of trees along the whole length of a river like this. Bald cypress is valuable for timber and they have been heavily logged. Way less than 1 percent of the original virgin bald cypress forests have survived.\u201d\nKatherine Skinner, executive director of The North Carolina Chapter of The Nature Conservancy said, \u201cDr. Stahle\u2019s original work on the Black River, which showed trees dating from Roman times, inspired us to begin conservation on the Black more than two decades ago. This ancient forest gives us an idea of what much of North Carolina\u2019s coastal plain looked like millennia ago. It is a source of inspiration and an important ecosystem. Without Dr. Stahle, it would have gone unprotected and likely destroyed.\u201d\nStahle said, \u201cThe area of old growth bald cypress was 10 times larger than I realized. We think there are older trees out there still.\u201d\nThe study is published in the journal Environmental Research Communications."

            "PARKLAND, FLA. (WSVN) - Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School\u2019s new principal has been named.\nOnly a weekend after the school\u2019s previous principal, Ty Thompson, announced he would resign from his position at the end of the school year, a replacement has already been assigned.\nMichelle Kefford, who is currently the principal of Flanagan High School, will take over Thompson\u2019s position in the upcoming school year.\nOn Monday morning, Broward County Public Schools announced the school\u2019s new leader. She was introduced during a news conference, Monday afternoon.\n\u201cMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in a lot of ways, is going back home,\u201d Kefford said. \u201cIt\u2019s where I started my career as an educator 20 years ago. I taught biology there for six years, and it was just an amazing experience.\u201d\nKefford said her son is a freshman at MSD.\n\u201cHe was at West Lakes Middle School during the incident when he was an 8th grader. We were impacted as a family,\u201d Kefford said.\nBCPS Board Member Lori Alhadeff, who lost her daughter Alyssa Alhadeff in the February 2018 shooting, said the change is good.\n\u201cShe is the Principal of the Year for the state of Florida [2019], and to have that leadership come into our community, it would help to bring the teachers and the students together for us to be able to move forward,\u201d Alhadeff said.\nThompson was principal of MSD for six years, which includes the year of the tragic shooting.\nSince the shooting took place at the high school, he has been under investigation for his handling of disciplinary actions.\nBCPS officials said Thompson asked to be reassigned.\n\u201cWe anticipate that he will remain in the district in some other capacity,\u201d BCPS Superintendent Robert Runcie said.\nThe Marjory Stoneman Douglas Safety Commission recommended the investigation to BCPS.\nThompson sent out a robocall to the MSD community which said:\n\u201cAdvisors and fellow colleagues always said take care of yourself. If at any point you feel like it is affecting your family or your health, you need to make a change. My decision was not an easy one. The district is supporting me, so I can step away from my position at MSD. I will be here for the remainder of the school year (including graduation) and will be sure to do everything I can to leave the school in the best shape possible for the next principal.\u201d\nThe Broward County School Board is expected to approve Kefford\u2019s hiring in June.\nCopyright 2022 Sunbeam Television Corp.

            "Beware: The upfronts are coming. While many fan-favorite series have gotten renewed, networks are also canceling a bevy of shows, from \u201cSpeechless\u201d to \u201cLethal Weapon.\u201d Look below for the full list of cancellations, and keep checking back as more announcements are made.\nABC\n\u201cWhiskey Cavalier\u201d: Despite featuring \u201cThe Walking Dead\u2019s\u201d Lauren Cohan and \u201cScandal\u201d alum Scott Foley, the action comedy-drama never found a substantial audience, and was canceled after one season at ABC.\n\u201cThe Kids Are Alright\u201d: Obvious and heartless pun aside, the family comedy won\u2019t see a second season. The series was inspired by the childhood of creator/executive producer Tim Doyle, and focuses on a traditional Irish-Catholic family in the 1970s.\n\u201cThe Fix\u201d: About a district attorney\u2019s redemption after suffering a \u201cdevastating defeat,\u201d the freshman drama won\u2019t get a second chance to make its case. It starred Robin Tunney, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, and Scott Cohen, and was executive produced and co-written by Marcia Clark (lead prosecutor in the O.J. Simpson case).\n\u201cFor the People\u201d: ABC has canceled the legal drama after two seasons, which was the second lowest rated of the Shondaland series, averaging almost 3 million total live viewers and a 0.51 in the 18-49 demo.\n\u201cSpeechless\u201d: It\u2019s the third and final season for the single-cam comedy. Maya DiMeo (Minnie Driver) is a mother who will do anything for her children, especially eldest son JJ (Micah Fowler), who has cerebral palsy. While the show was a solid part of ABC\u2019s family comedy lineup for the past few years, the recent season has ranked the lowest rated of the network\u2019s scripted series, averaging 2.3 million total live viewers and a 0.49 in the 18-49 demo.\n\u201cSplitting Up Together\u201d: ABC has pulled the family comedy after two seasons. The show, starring Jenna Fischer and Oliver Hudson as exes who live together and redevelop feelings for each other, was the second-lowest scripted series for the network. It averaged 2.77 total million live viewers and a 0.66 in the 18-49 demographic.\nCBS\n\u201cFam\u201d: CBS said \u201cIt\u2019s a no from me, dawg\u201d to renewing \u201cFam,\u201d the comedy about an engaged couple (Nina Dobrev, Tone Bell) whose lives are disrupted when their 16-year-old relative comes to live with them.\n\u201cHappy Together\u201c: It\u2019s a sad future for \u201cHappy Together,\u201d which CBS pulled after the first season. The comedy starred Damon Wayans, Jr. and Amber Stevens West as a 30-something couple who reconnect with their younger, cooler selves when a pop star (Felix Mallard) is drawn to their ordinary suburban life and unexpectedly moves in with them.\n\u201cLife In Pieces\u201d: Created by Justin Adler and starring Dianne Wiest and James Brolin, the comedy revolved around one big, happy family and their milestone moments. The cancellation arrives only five episodes into the fourth season, which is averaging a 0.84 rating in the 18-49 demo and 5.75 million viewers per episode, representing a dip from last season.\n\u201cMurphy Brown\u201d: Unfortunately, Candice Bergen\u2019s return as the news legend was short lived. The first season of the sitcom concluded after 13 episodes, and CBS opted out of ordering more. The revival saw Brown entering back into the journalism ring amid the 24-hour news cycle and a vastly different political climate than when she (and the show) was last on.\nFox\n\u201cProven Innocent\u201d: The Kelsey Grammar-starring legal drama didn\u2019t light any fires at Fox, where it was canceled after one season. David Elliot served as writer and executive producer on the project, while \u201cEmpire\u201d co-creator Danny Strong and Stacy Greenberg also executive produced. The series centered on a legal team, led by Madeline Scott (Rachelle Lefevre), that reopened investigations, putting their own lives in danger to exonerate the innocent that were \u2018proven\u2019 guilty.\n\u201cThe Cool Kids\u201d: The comedy proved lukewarm for Fox, which canceled the multi-cam after one season. The show hailed from executive producer Charlie Day and starred David Alan Grier, Leslie Jordan, Vicki Lawrence and Martin Mull as four friends in a retirement community who are determined to make the third act of their lives the craziest one yet.\n\u201cThe Gifted\u201d: Set in the Marvel \u201cX-Men\u201d universe, the drama about teenagers with mutant powers couldn\u2019t prevail at Fox. Following the show\u2019s first season, the average rating for Season 2 almost halved down to 0.59, while the average viewership dipped to 1.95 million.\n\u201cLove Connection\u201d: There was no love for the unscripted series, which Fox canceled after two seasons. It was hosted by Andy Cohen and premiered in the summer along with \u201cBeat Shazam.\u201d\n\u201cThe Passage\u201d: The network also closed the chapter on \u201cThe Passage,\u201d based on Justin Cronin\u2019s trilogy of novels. It centered on a young girl (Saniyya Sidney), who is taken by agent Brad Wolgast (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) for a mysterious government experiment, and ends up trying to save her from the same project.\n\u201cRel\u201d: Creator and \u201cGet Out\u201d star Lil Rel Howery couldn\u2019t escape the show\u2019s fate. Canned after one season, the multi-cam comedy featured Howery as a self-made success who has to start over when he finds out his wife is having an affair with his barber. After returning solid ratings for its premiere, \u201cRel\u201d saw a severe ratings dip for the remainder of the series, ending up with an average rating of 0.77 and a hint over 2 million total viewers.\n\u201cLethal Weapon\u201d: Fox has put an end to the one-hour \u201cLethal Weapon\u201d adaptation after three seasons, which might not come as a surprise to those following the drama surrounding the series. The show originally starred Clayne Crawford and Damon Wayans as a buddy cop duo, but the stars\u2019 off-camera fighting led to Crawford\u2019s dismissal. Season 3 continued with Seann William Scott replacing Crawford, but it was the beginning of the end, with Wayans announcing he was quitting, coupled with a steep decline in ratings.\nNBC\n\u201cAP Bio\u201d: Mike O\u2019Brien\u2019s series starring \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\u2019s\u201d Glenn Howerton was the second-lowest rated scripted series for the network in its second season. Howerton starred as a disgraced Harvard philosophy scholar who returned to his Ohio hometown to teach high school biology. Patton Oswalt also starred.\n\u201cI Feel Bad\u201d: NBC\u2019s cancellation of the comedy will no doubt leave fans in a sour mood. The show starred Sarayu Blue as a \u201cperfect mom, boss, wife, friend and daughter\u201d who in real life is far from perfect but figuring things out."

Wow I can't believe you are 15!!! Time is flying by!!! I love you all very much. I wish you the best day ever and I hope you enjoy your birthday celebrations today and this weekend!!! Love always, Dad.\"\nLast year, Jon was awarded temporary sole legal and physical custody of Collin, who had spent time away from his family at an out-of-state educational program for kids with special needs, and also said Hannah lives with him \"permanently.\" Their sextuplet siblings live with their mother, Jon's ex-wife and former Jon & Kate Plus 8 co-star, and the former couple also shares 18-year-old twin daughters."

            "The Game of Thrones finale is almost here, and there\u2019s no shortage of theories and speculation around Season 8, Episode 6. However, there\u2019s one GoT leak out there that could actually reveal what happens in the show\u2019s final episode before it even airs.\nWarning: HUGE Game of Thrones finale spoilers below.\nThis leak comes to us from redditor u/afraidpart, who shared several posts full of Game of Thrones spoilers roughly nine months ago. At the time, they were ignored, but midway through Season 8, those claims started to come true.\nSubscribe for free to Multiverse and get Game of Thrones coverage delivered to your inbox the night the episode airs.\nHere\u2019s a list of Game of Thrones Season 8 leaks from u/afraidpart that already happened:\nThe Mountain kills Missandei.\nThe Night King dies in Episode 3.\nThe Hound and the Mountain both die in Cleganebowl.\nJaime and Cersei Lannister die together in a somewhat unsatisfying way.\nSo what\u2019s next? Redditor u/afraidpart\u2019s intel on Game of Thrones Season 8, Episode 6 was a little bit less clear, but we do have a few juicy details.\nAlso read: Who lived and who died in Game of Thrones Season 8, Episode 5.\nHere\u2019s my personal favorite:\n\u201cThe Iron Throne gets melted by the dragon.\u201d\nActually, it\u2019s possible that already happened. Daenerys and Drogon basically leveled King\u2019s Landing in Episode 5, and that may have included the Iron Throne. We never got a look into the throne room during last night\u2019s episode. Could the Game of Thrones finale open on an image of the throne melted or destroyed? We wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that\u2019s exactly what happens.\nOn a similar note, the Season 8 leak claims that \u201cJon Snow finally sees Arya after they get to the throne.\u201d We\u2019re guessing this means Jon will see his sister using her Faceless Man training, possibly right after she assassinates someone else (Dany?).\nAs for Tyrion, it looks like he\u2019ll do exactly what we expect and turn on Daenerys in the Game of Thrones finale:\nWhen Daenerys is making her speech everyone is mad at her. Tyrion makes some comment (he doesn\u2019t get sound) and throws his pin (?) on the ground and she sends him to the prison? Idk what was going on here.\nFinally, when it comes to Jon and Dany, it\u2019s unclear exactly how Game of Thrones Season 8 will end. Based on this leak, it seems HBO might have actually filmed multiple different versions of the finale. However, we do get one pretty awesome description of how Daenerys could die:\nDanaerys actually DOES die, she\u2019s killed (stabbed I think) by Jon Snow. She goes back to the throne room and touches the throne. Has no idea WHY he kills her, there\u2019s a missing chunk. But it happens in the throne room. I asked him why and he said he doesn\u2019t know and I don\u2019t even think they saw the actual death scene, just the fact that she\u2019s dead. So he\u2019s only assuming she gets murdered, otherwise she commits suicide but that doesn\u2019t make much sense. Then the dragon flies away with her body but doesn\u2019t kill Snow. Either way, she dies.\nThat\u2019s a lot to pack into a single episode of television, but with an 80-minute runtime, it\u2019s possible that Game of Thrones Season 8, Episode 6 will be able to get the job done.\nThe Game of Thrones finale airs Sunday, May 19 at 9 p.m. Eastern on HBO."

            "The moon may look serene and unchanging from a distance. But we\u2019ve known for years that it\u2019s slowly shrinking, and a surprising new study suggests the change may be triggering seismic activity.\nAs its interior continues to cool and contract \u2014 it\u2019s believed to have slimmed down by about 150 feet over the last few hundred million years \u2014 our solitary natural satellite is being rocked by moonquakes and its brittle, pockmarked crust crisscrossed by low ridges known as scarps, according to the research.\n\u201cOne of the main perceptions of the moon for the past half century is that nothing interesting (besides asteroid or comet impacts) has happened there for billions of years,\u201d Geoffrey Collins, a geologist at Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts, and a co-author of the study, told NBC News MACH in an email. \u201cI think the main takeaway is that the moon is still active today.\u201d\nThe study was published May 13 in the journal Nature Geoscience.\nEarth\u2019s moon is the fifth largest in the solar system. With a circumference of nearly 6,800 miles, it\u2019s 3.7 times smaller than our home planet. Scientists believe it was actually once part of Earth, having broken off after a collision with a Mars-sized space rock about 4.5 billion years ago. It\u2019s been cooling slowly ever since, shrinking as its interior temperature dips.\nFor the new research, scientists at the Smithsonian Institution, NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center and three other institutions took a fresh look at data from four lunar seismometers deployed by NASA astronauts during the Apollo missions of the 1960s and \u201970s.\nThe Taurus-Littrow valley is the location of the Apollo 17 landing site (asterisk). Cutting across the valley, just above the landing site, is the Lee-Lincoln fault scarp. Movement on the fault was the likely source of numerous moonquakes that triggered events in the valley. NASA/GSFC/Arizona State University/Smithsonian\nUsing an algorithm designed to find the locations of quakes from limited data, the researchers mapped 28 moonquakes that the seismometers recorded from 1969 to \u201977. Then they cross-referenced the epicenters of the quakes with super-detailed images of the moon taken by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft.\nThe scientists found that eight of the moonquakes originated near scarps, which are known to form when adjacent pieces of lunar crust along a fault line push up against each other. And six of the quakes occurred when the moon was close to apogee, the point in its orbit around Earth when it\u2019s farthest from our planet and subjected to moon-shaking stress from its gravity.\nOn the basis of these findings, the researchers concluded that the eight quakes were likely triggered by movements of the lunar crust. Their finding was supported by a computer simulation and by the LRO images, which showed fallen boulders and other signs of recent seismic activity.\nThis prominent lunar lobate thrust fault scarp is one of thousands discovered in Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera images. NASA/GSFC/Arizona State University/Smithsonian\n\u201cWhat we didn't know was how recently the young faults had been active,\u201d Thomas Watters, a senior scientist at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National Air and Space Museum in Washington, said in an email. \u201cThat was a surprise!\u201d\n\"I think it is a great start at explaining the origin of shallow moonquakes\" shown by the Apollo seismometers, Clive Neal, a moon researcher and Notre Dame engineering professor who was not involved with the study, said of the research in an email. \"We had no clue what caused these.\"\nThe findings could someday help guide the placement of future moon settlements far away from moonquake-prone areas, he added.\nBoth Neal and the researchers said more seismographs will be needed if scientists are to gain a better understanding of seismic activity on the moon, which NASA says will have human visitors again by 2024. In the meantime, Watters and his colleagues plan to compare images of the moon\u2019s surface from different years to see how the scarps evolved over time.\nAdditional reporting by David Freeman\nWant more stories about space?\nSIGN UP FOR THE MACH NEWSLETTER AND FOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM."

            "Doris Day, one of Hollywood\u2019s most popular stars of the 1950s and \u201960s who was Oscar-nommed for \u201cPillow Talk\u201d and starred in her own TV show, has died. She was 97.\nThe Doris Day Animal Foundation confirmed the legendary actress-singer died on Monday at her Carmel Valley, Calif. home.\nThough she was marketed as a wholesome girl-next-door type, the comedies for which she was most well-known were actually sexy and daring for their time, and her personal life was tumultuous, with four marriages and a notorious lawsuit.\nThe vivacious blonde, who also had a successful singing career, teamed with Rock Hudson in \u201cPillow Talk\u201d and other lighthearted romantic comedies including \u201cLover Come Back\u201d and \u201cSend Me No Flowers.\u201d Her other significant screen roles included Alfred Hitchcock thriller \u201cThe Man Who Knew Too Much\u201d (1956), co-starring James Stewart and featuring Day\u2019s Oscar-winning song \u201cQue Sera Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be\u201d); and \u201cThe Pajama Game\u201d (1957), based on the Broadway musical.\nAfter many successful films, she starred on CBS in \u201cThe Doris Day Show\u201d for five years starting in 1968, and soon after retired to Carmel, Calif. She released 29 albums, most recently \u201cMy Heart,\u201d which consisted of previously unreleased songs, in 2011.\nIn her autobiography, \u201cDoris Day: Her Own Story,\u201d she caused something of a stir while promoting the book by rejecting the \u201cgirl next door\u201d and \u201cprofessional virgin\u201d labels so often attached to her. In the 1975 book she remarked: \u201cThe succession of cheerful, period musicals I made, plus Oscar Levant\u2019s highly publicized comment about my virginity (\u2018I knew Doris Day before she became a virgin\u2019), contributed to what has been called my \u2018image,\u2019 which is a word that baffles me. There never was any intent on my part either in my acting or in my private life to create any such thing as an image.\u201d\nBut her rise in popularity coincided with World War II and the Korean War, and she quickly became a favorite with servicemen. Day leapt into the spotlight in 1945 with the release of her hit song \u201cSentimental Journey,\u201d recorded with Les Brown and His Band of Renown; the song became symbolic for G.I.s returning from WWII to their families. She had also done early vocal work with the big bands of Barney Rapp and Bob Crosby. She had a second hit record with \u201cMy Dreams Are Getting Better All the Time.\u201d\nAfter she separated from her second husband, George Weidler, in 1948, Day apparently intended to leave Los Angeles and return to her mother\u2019s home in Cincinnati. Her agent, Al Levy, convinced her to attend a party at the home of composer Jule Styne. There she performed the song \u201cEmbraceable You,\u201d impressing Styne and partner Sammy Cahn; they recommended her for a role in \u201cRomance on the High Seas,\u201d on which they were then working for Warner Bros. The main role was to be recast after Betty Hutton exited due to pregnancy, and Day got it.\nPHOTOS: Doris Day\u2019s Life and Career in Pictures\nThe Michael Curtiz-directed musical comedy, her debut feature film gig, provided her with another hit recording, the Oscar-nominated \u201cIt\u2019s Magic.\u201d Day starred in a number of Curtiz films in the early and mid-\u201950s, among them \u201cYoung Man With a Horn\u201d with Kirk Douglas and Lauren Bacall.\nIn the early \u201950s she made a series of nostalgic period musicals for Warner Bros., including \u201cTea for Two,\u201d \u201cOn Moonlight Bay\u201d and \u201cBy the Light of the Silvery Moon,\u201d for Warner Brothers. Attempting to cut loose from her dainty image, Day began accepting more nuanced parts, including her favorite role as Western tomboy Calamity Jane in director David Butler\u2019s 1953 film of the same name.\nThe New York Times called Day\u2019s performance in the Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cThe Man Who Knew Too Much,\u201d in which she was well cast as a retired singer, \u201csurprisingly effective.\u201d\nDay was apparently not an immediate fan of \u201cQue Sera Sera\u201d and expressed doubts about the durability of the tune that would become her signature song. It was, however, used again in two more Day films \u2014 \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Eat the Daisies\u201d (1960) and, in a brief duet, in \u201cThe Glass Bottom Boat\u201d (1966) \u2014 and was subsequently used as the theme song for her CBS TV show.\nDay also teamed with James Garner onscreen in 1963\u2019s \u201cThe Thrill of It All\u201d and \u201cMove Over, Darling.\u201d\nHer last film, 1968\u2019s \u201cWith Six You Get Egg Roll,\u201d in which she starred with Brian Keith, was released in the same year as the successful Lucille Ball-Henry Fonda comedy \u201cYours, Mine and Ours,\u201d employing a very similar premise of two people with children from previous marriages coming together.\nIt was also significant because of the ambiguity of certain scenes that could be interpreted as meaning that the central characters slept together before marriage \u2014 a first for a Day character and interesting at a time when comedians were calling her the world\u2019s oldest virgin. She was offered the role of Mrs. Robinson in \u201cThe Graduate,\u201d which could have gone a long way to modernizing what had become a square image, but turned it down because she thought the sexual relationship was exploitative.\nBorn Doris Mary Kappelhoff in Evanston, Ohio, Day was initially interested in dancing but a car accident when she was 13 ended the possibility of such a career. She began singing as a teenager after joining a local dance band, which renamed her Doris Day in honor of her song \u201cDay After Day.\u201d Until her birth certificate surfaced in 2017, she was often reported as having been born in 1924.\nPOPULAR THIS WEEK:\nHer first marriage was to trombonist Al Jorden in 1941, who she was said to have left because of his abusiveness. They had a son, Terry, who was adopted in 1951 by Day\u2019s third husband, agent Marty Melcher, and later became a successful music producer in the 1960s and \u201970s, working with the Beach Boys and Randy Newman. Day\u2019s second marriage to Band of Renown saxophonist Weidler lasted only eight months.\nHusband Melcher and his business partner, Jerome Bernard Rosenthal, secretly squandered her earnings, however, and she won a $22 million judgment against Rosenthal in 1974 (Marty Melcher was already dead), though the case dragged on for years. Son Terry Melcher, who died in 2004, is often mentioned in connection to the Manson murders, as Sharon Tate was killed in the house that he had been renting and he had met Charles Manson when he was an aspiring musician.\nDay was married to restaurant maitre d\u2019 Barry Comden from 1976-81. In 1985 she briefly hosted her own talkshow, \u201cDoris Day\u2019s Best Friends,\u201d on CBN. She received the Golden Globes\u2019 Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement in motion pictures in 1989 and was awarded a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2008, though she did not attend the latter ceremony.\nIn 2004, Day was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom; she opted not to attend the ceremony because of a fear of flying. For the same reason Day did not accept an invitation to be a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors, she said on her website.\nIn Carmel, she became an animal rights advocate and created the Doris Day Animal Foundation. While Day was reluctant to speak to the press or travel to Los Angeles for appearances, she was not a recluse despite reports to the contrary.\nShe is survived by her grandson Ryan."

            "Game of Thrones has split fans down the middle with its eighth season. Shocking choices, confusing decisions, and lackluster deaths have left some viewers resoundingly disappointed. If you\u2019re one of those less than happy with the wild events of the penultimate episode then you\u2019ll probably enjoy the knowledge that you\u2019re not alone. Some of the people most distressed by the events of the final season are the cast of Game of Thrones themselves.\nThis three-minute video collects multiple clips of the cast appearing less than happy with the uneven final entry. including the now viral moment that Emilia Clarke, Jacob Anderson, and Nathalie Emmanuel tried to stay positive about their final scenes in the show during a chat with ET.\nAnother striking moment is Kit Harington calling the finale \u201cDisappointing\u201d and Joe Dempsie complaining\u2013completely correctly\u2013about the lack of character development for his lovely blacksmith, Gendry. There\u2019s plenty of side eye, shade, and smirks as the cast try to keep their contractually obligated cheeriness about the route that their characters have taken during the unexpected and twist-filled final couple of seasons.\nIt\u2019s equally satisfying and saddening about seeing the people who have dedicated so much of the last decade to bringing these characters to life, also have a problem with the direction that they\u2019ve taken. There\u2019s even an audio clip of George R.R. Martin talking about his unhappiness with some of the twists that were seemingly inserted at the last minute. Basically, at this point, it feels like only Benioff and Weiss are completely happy with the choices they\u2019ve made for Westeros and the people who live in the Seven Kingdoms.\nThis video doesn\u2019t exactly imbue us with hope for the final episode of the fantasy epic, but it does make us feel far less alone. Oh dear. What\u2019s gonna happen?\nImages: HBO"

            "Lenovo ThinkPad X1 foldable teases future of ultraportable laptops\nLenovo has just unveiled one of its most incredible devices to date: a foldable Windows-based PC designed for business executives, on-the-go professionals, and anyone who wants to be on the cutting edge of technology. The foldable will be part of the company's popular ThinkPad X1 family when it arrives on the market next year, offering buyers a device with a flexible display that can function as their primary PC.\nLenovo has kicked off its presence in the foldables market in a big way with its new ThinkPad foldable PC prototype. The Windows-based device will feature a foldable OLED screen from LG Display; it has a 2K resolution and 4:3 aspect ratio, measures 9.6-inches in half-screen, and 13.3-inches for the full screen.\nThe device utilizes Intel technology and includes a number of notable features, the incredible display aside, including stereo speakers, a pair of USB-C ports, and an infrared camera. In addition to a Bluetooth keyboard, the device will also provide users with a Wacom pen for times when a stylus is ideal. Buyers can expect all-day battery life on a single charge.\nThe foldable ThinkPad X1 device will be able to replace your laptop to serve as your primary PC, according to Lenovo. The device sports a torque hinge that enables the screen to be positioned at various angles in the same way a traditional laptop screen can be positioned at the ideal angle. Lenovo avoided any potential issues related to top-heaviness by using the battery to add weight to the bottom part of the device.\nBuyers can expect the same level of quality they get from other ThinkPad devices; in fact, Lenovo anticipates users frequently folding and unfolding the device, which is why it doubled the hinge cycles it uses to test its laptop products. The new foldable is the result of three years of development, giving us our first look at the future of highly portable laptops.\nLenovo will offer more details on the device, including availability, in the future."

(Photo by Adam Glanzman/Getty Images)\nAll you had to do was take one look at Joel Embiid post-game to see what had just happened to the 76ers. Philadelphia was eliminated in gut-wrenching fashion.\nThe Toronto Raptors advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals in a classic Game 7, winning 92-90 on a ridiculous buzzer-beater by Kawhi Leonard. Leonard's shot will go down as one of the most memorable in NBA history.\nAs the Toronto team and fans celebrated, Embiid appeared beside himself as he walked off the court. He was visibly in tears and had to be consoled on the court by a few Raptors players.\nIn the tunnel leading to the locker room, the TV cameras caught Embiid in tears.\nEmbiid finished with 21 points and 11 rebounds in a losing effort. He's young, and will hopefully be back in this situation again.\nHowever, Philly has some choices to make this offseason. Namely, they must decide what to do with Tobias Harris and Jimmy Butler, and explore if they want to shake up the team's core at all. Oh, and head coach Brett Brown may be fired.\nMeanwhile, the Raptors are one step closer to the NBA Finals. They'll play the Milwaukee Bucks for the right to go there."

            "WARNING: The following story contains spoilers from the latest episode of Game of Thrones.\nThe penultimate episode Game of Thrones, did not waste any time tying up loose ends \u2014 and unsurprisingly, contained several emotional goodbyes and a whole lotta bloodshed.\nSo who all died? Well, if you\u2019re looking for a cheat sheet, here you go: Lord Varys (Conleth Hill), Euron Greyjoy (Pilou Asb\u00e6k), The Hound aka Sandor Clegane (Rory McCann), The Mountain aka Gregor Clegane (Haf\u00fe\u00f3r J\u00fal\u00edus Bj\u00f6rnsson), Qyburn (Anton Lesser), Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), and Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey).\nThe episode, called \u201cThe Bells,\u201d opened with an early exit for a favorite player \u2014 Lord Varys aka Master of Whisperers, was killed by Dany\u2019s (Emilia Clarke) last dragon Drogon for essentially trying to convince Jon Snow (Kit Harington) to take his rightful place on the Iron Throne.\nSnow refuses to waver in his loyalty to his Queen, but Dany herself seems overcome with suspicion and fear, and showing more and more signs she\u2019s becoming the \u201cMad Queen.\u201d\nRELATED: Game of Thrones Fans Think Daenerys\u2019 Dragons Secretly Had Babies \u2014 Which Could Change Everything\nTyrion (Peter Dinklage) participates in two acts of betrayal \u2014 one toward Varys and one toward Dany when he frees his brother Jaime from where he was captured by her Unsullied army.\n\u201cYou were the only one who didn\u2019t treat me like a monster,\u201d Tyrion says to Jaime as he helps him escape, telling him that he hopes Jaime will find Cersei and whisk her away from King\u2019s Landing before the war between Dany and Cersei\u2019s armies takes place.\nA scene from Game of Thrones\u2018 \u201cThe Last War,\u201d the fifth episode of season eight.\nWar in King\u2019s Landing is not averted, of course. The next day sees Dany and Drogon lay waste to Euron Greyjoy\u2019s Iron Fleet of ships, their \u201cdragon killer\u201d Scorpion weapons, as well as much of the Gold Company who came in to assist Cersei, courtesy the fearsome Unsullied.\nThere is a brief moment of peace when the bells ring and the audience is made to think Cersei might surrender, but it turns to full-on war between the two sides \u2014 with Dany leaning fully into the suspicions about her mental health as she and Drogon go about killing countless innocent citizens in King\u2019s Landing.\nRELATED: Game of Thrones\u2018 Greyworm and Missandei Dance to \u2018My Boo\u2019 as She Bids Farewell to Her Character\nMeanwhile Euron Greyjoy and Jaime engage in bloody hand-to-hand combat that results in Euron\u2019s death. He dies believing he\u2019s mortally wounded Jaime. \u201cI\u2019m the man who killed Jaime Lannister,\u201d he says, dying, with a smile on his face.\nCut to Arya and The Hound, who are on a mission to kill Cersei and The Hound\u2019s undead brother Ser Gregor \u201cThe Mountain\u201d Clegane. The Hound convinces Arya to temporarily turn away from her hunt for Cersei. They part ways, in search of separate targets, and The Hound is finally able to confront the one and only person he wants to kill.\nWith The Hound and The Mountain fighting to very bloody deaths, Cersei flees and almost literally runs into Jaime\u2019s arms.\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d she says.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he responds. They wander off together as the walls around them continue to crumble and burn.\nOf the major players still living and in the fight, Jon calls for the army to fall back and head to safety; Arya gets jostled around and struck by debris as she\u2019s trying to flee the Red Keep. She\u2019s nearly crushed when a tower falls, but helps a group of survivors keep moving away from danger. They are stopped short when Drogon\u2019s fire blasts through the scene.\nBack with still-bleeding Jaime and Cersei, who are trapped in an underground passageway, emotional but resigned to accept their doomed fate.\n\u201cNothing else matters, only us,\u201d Jaime says to Cersei as the walls collapse on top of them.\nThe episode ends with Arya, bloodied, dusty with ash from the city burning around her, coming upon a white horse, and riding away from the death and debris around her.\nThe series finale of Game of Thrones airs Sunday May 19 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO."

            "SPOILERS AHEAD from Game of Thrones Season 8, Episode 5. Also WARNING: Toward the end of this post, I'm gonna rant like a mofo about Dany's TV character development.\nGame of Thrones just Dracarys-ed the hell out of Daenerys Targaryen's storyline as a hero of the game. In Season 8, Episode 5, \"The Bells,\" the Breaker of Chains ignored the King's Landing bells signalling the city's surrender. She and Drogon instead covered King's Landing in fire and blood -- not just the soldiers, but thousands of innocent people. No matter what happens in the May 19 finale, there's no coming back from that.\nIt was quite a change of pace for the fire-loving dragon queen who had never before turned her Dracarys powers on civilians completely out of the game. Tyrion Lannister used wildfire to kill thousands and win the Battle of the Blackwater and Arya Stark killed off an entire House, but in context those kills -- and Dany's previous kills, even the Tarlys -- could all be fairly explained, keeping our heroes on the right side.\nBut now?\nEmilia Clarke knew this was coming, of course. She got the final season scripts and filmed them, and she shared multiple hints along the way that Dany's story would take a dramatic turn for the worse.\nOne fan dug up a pre-Season 8 ET interview Emilia Clarke did with Nathalie Emmanuel (Missandei) and Jacob Anderson (Grey Worm), showing Emilia dying to say what she really thinks:\nET: Have you shot your final scenes yet [nods from cast] and are you happy with how things ended?Nathalie Emmanuel: Yes.[Emilia Clarke cringe-smiles and nervous-laughs.]ET [pointing to Emilia]: She didn't say yes. You didn't say yes.Emilia: Best season ever!\nOoh, but you have to watch how she says it. It's pretty clear she did not think it would be the best season ever:\nSee more\nIt reminded me of Michael Scott on The Office:\nOr the Chrissy Teigen cringe smile:\nProps to Nathalie Emmanuel for staying spoiler strong there, even though Missandei was killed off last week. She could've joined Emilia Clarke in cringe-laughing but instead kept a straight face and stayed loyal to the show.\nI'm with Emilia, though. And that interview was not the only time she gave fans a hint that Dany's storyline would go south.\nRemember a year ago, when Emilia Clarke was asked about filming Dany's final on-screen moment? Here's what she had said to Vanity Fair about that:\nIt fucked me up. Knowing that is going to be a lasting flavor in someone's mouth of what Daenerys is.\nThat unsettling reaction was a big hint that Dany would go out in a negative way.\nEmilia Clarke joked about it again after the airing of Episode 5, saying on Instagram she needed a lot of liquor to get through the May 12 episode (the only episode so far this season with a \"rotten\" score, by the way):\n(opens in new tab) A photo posted by on\nGame of Thrones has never been a show that cares about fan service, but it should care about character consistency.\nThat's why so many Dany fans (especially book readers like myself) are pissed off at the showrunners for the past couple of seasons, but especially the writing of Season 8. Dany's Season 8 story took a dramatic turn from the woman who always stood up for the people, and never wanted to be the queen of ashes. They even had her begging Jon not to tell anyone about his lineage. They made her weak and desperate, something very far from Book Dany and also foreign to most of HBO Dany's story. Imagine if the situation were reversed and Jon started slaughtering innocent people. Fans would rightfully be confused and frustrated at such a huge character change.\nJust because she got mad doesn't mean she had to go mad. But Game of Thrones decided to go hard on The Mad Queen angle in Season 8. Instead of just letting her be as ruthless as Arya or Tyrion when it counts -- something she had shown the whole time, and why she was able to win so many good people to her side -- they decided to tip her scales to madness.\nDany deserved better than to be lumped in with her abusive brother Viserys and their father The Mad King just because they are Targaryens. (Meanwhile, Rhaegar, who dumped his wife and kids for Lyanna Stark, is somehow \"noble\"? OK.) Jon is a Targaryen too, but no one calls him out on anything he's done -- or not done, since he's become one of the most passive characters -- or decides it's because of his dragon blood.\nI know not everyone agrees. That's the beauty of a show like Game of Thrones. It inspires strong opinions, but not the same strong opinions. Some fans think Dany has been going mad the whole time in a steady progression. Others just never liked her. We were warned that fans would have divided opinions on the final season, depending on various characters' fates. So be it.\nGame of Thrones' final episode ever airs this Sunday, May 19 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO. And then we can spend the rest of our lives debating it like the Lost finale (I actually liked that ending, gods save me), the Dexter finale (actually is there a debate there or do we all agree that one sucked?) and The Sopranos finale."

            "An early look at how the running backs stack up early in the 2019 preseason, since it\u2019s never too soon to hammer out rankings in preparation for the fantasy season.\nWe continue our series taking a look at early 2019 positional rankings for fantasy football. As with our quarterback rankings, we will focus on redraft rankings \u2014 how players should be ranked when considering 2019 only. However, they can easily be recast for dynasty purposes by moving up players who are young with big upside, while moving down players who are aging or beginning to decline in value.\nThe rankings will be done in tiers, which is an optimal way to prepare for drafts because it assists in making an easier choice when on the clock. If a player is the final one left in a tier, while there might be three players left in a tier at another position, that may help highlight which player one should choose. These rankings are based on PPR (point-per-reception) leagues, which is quickly overtaking \u201cstandard\u201d scoring as the new standard. Let\u2019s jump in.\nTier 1\nSaquon Barkley, New York Giants\nAlvin Kamara, New Orleans Saints\nEzekiel Elliott, Dallas Cowboys\nChristian McCaffrey, Carolina Panthers\nThese players should be the first four players chosen, in some order, in nearly every draft this year. They will all play the vast majority of the snaps for their respective teams this year, and all have elite or near elite pass-catching ability. All are also used in the red zone. Christian McCaffrey might have climbed to the second spot here if we knew Cam Newton would be 100 percent healthy. And an argument can be made for Alvin Kamara over Saquon Barkley since he\u2019s on such a better offensive team, but that didn\u2019t bother Barkley last season.\nTier 2\nMelvin Gordon, Los Angeles Chargers\nDavid Johnson, Arizona Cardinals\nJoe Mixon, Cincinnati Bengals\nTodd Gurley, Los Angeles Rams\nNick Chubb, Cleveland Browns\nThe second tier of backs all have huge upside, but most come with some downside potential. For example, David Johnson could return to being a top scorer, but the Cardinals still are not a good team, even with Kyler Murray. The same goes for the Bengals and Joe Mixon. And Todd Gurley has been dealing with knee issues, which pushed him out of the top tier. Still, any of these players could end up as a top-three running back in scoring and it would be a surprise."

She had been on the road for close to one year,\" an official in the South Korean embassy in Paris told AFP.\nHe added that the \"regular tourist\" had asked for her identity to be kept private.\nShe had previously visited Senegal and Mali in west Africa, as well as other countries during a major trip from her home,a region \"in the middle of South Korea,\" the official said.\nShe was snatched around a month ago by armed men while attempting to cross by car from Burkina Faso into neighbouring Benin, apparently along with an American woman who was also rescued by the French forces.\n\"That is my understanding (that the women were together), but we don't speak for the American lady,\" the official added.\nThe US government has declined to comment about its national, but the ABC news channel has reported she was also a tourist, aged in her 60s.\n- 'Going home' -\nThe South Korean woman, who appeared in between the two French hostages as they made a statement to the media on Saturday in Paris, has been admitted for a medical check up at a military hospital in Paris.\n\"She doesn't have any particular problems,\" the official said. \"She will be going back home, today or tomorrow.\"\nThe embassy official confirmed that the woman had been held for 27-28 days in captivity and had been \"moved from one place to another a few times\".\nAsked about the identity of the hostage-takers, \"she said she didn't know,\" the official added. \"We dont know. You have to check with the French government.\"\nThe official confirmed that the South Korean government had been unaware that one of its citizens was being held in the area.\nFrance's defence minister, Florence Parly, had previously told reporters that French forces staging the rescue had been surprised to find the South Korean and American women being held hostage alongside the two French tourists.\n- Freed from 'hell' -\nParly did not say who was responsible for the kidnappings, but said the hostage-takers were planning to transfer their victims to Islamist groups in Mali who are aligned to either Al-Qaeda or Islamic State.\nThe French hostages, Patrick Picque and Laurent Lassimouillas, admitted that they should have heeded the French foreign ministry's advice on avoiding risky areas after they were seized in Benin close to the border with Burkina Faso.\n\"We certainly should have better taken into account the government's advice as well as the complexities of Africa,\" Lassimouillas said in a statement.\n\"Our first thoughts go to the families of the soldiers who freed us from this hell,\" he added.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron will lead a commemoration ceremony for the slain commandoes in Paris on Tuesday at the Invalides military hospital and museum.\n? 2019 AFP"

            "THE MAKING OF A JUSTICE\nReflections on My First 94 Years\nBy John Paul Stevens\nJohn Paul Stevens ended his remarkable 35-year term on the Supreme Court with the approval of the Republican president who appointed him and the Democratic one who replaced him. Gerald Ford wrote in 2005 that he was prepared to let \u201chistory\u2019s judgment\u201d of his presidency rest exclusively on his decision in 1975 to nominate Stevens. Barack Obama scrawled his endorsement on a birthday note to Stevens in 2014 \u2014 \u201cWe miss you on the Court!\u201d\nThe cross-party embrace of Stevens by these two presidents shows the distance to the right the Republican Party has traveled from Ford to Trump far more than Stevens\u2019s own shift in the opposite direction. He was the last of a group of Republican appointees (Earl Warren, William Brennan, Harry Blackmun, David Souter and, to a degree, Sandra Day O\u2019Connor) who breathed compassion into the law and put the impact of their decisions on real people above arid theories. In one of his last judicial opinions, Stevens wrote that his approach to interpreting the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of liberty \u201cis guided by history but not beholden to it.\u201d He described his willingness to \u201cprotect some rights even if they have not already received uniform protection from the elected branches.\u201d And crucially he argued that no method can separate the beliefs of individual judges from the work of the court. \u201cIt all depends on judges\u2019 exercising careful, reasoned judgment,\u201d Stevens wrote. \u201cAs it always has, and as it always will.\u201d\n[ John Paul Stevens has died. Read our obituary here. ]\nClues to how Stevens arrived at that conclusion are sprinkled through \u201cThe Making of a Justice,\u201d but only if you dig for them. Stevens\u2019s new book (the third since his retirement in 2010) is more catalog than sustained argument. It suffers from the burden of completism and the frustration of muffled drama. In 1933, when Stevens was 12, his father was charged with embezzlement, and a group of armed robbers who thought he\u2019d hidden $1 million in tomato cans burst into the family\u2019s house one evening. But Stevens plays down the effects. \u201cI do not recall any special fear for our safety during the ensuing months in that year,\u201d he writes.\nTurning to his time as a justice, he devotes a chapter each to his 36 terms on the court. To follow the intellectual arc from one decision to a later one that relates to it, you have to read a lot of pages. Which, come to think of it, is probably what it feels like to do the work of a Supreme Court justice."
