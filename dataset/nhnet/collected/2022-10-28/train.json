            "You\u2019ll have to forgive my ignorance\u2014but what is an appropriate gift for Data Privacy Day? Perhaps an encrypted portable drive? That might not be a bad idea, but what I have for you instead is the collected wisdom of a number of cybersecurity professionals\u2014people who make a living safeguarding data and protecting privacy.\nThe issue of data privacy and data security seems more relevant now than ever. People are essentially numb at this point to the constant barrage of data breach notifications and revelations of how nefarious attackers have compromised or exposed their data\u2014but now we are also seeing more incidents of the \u201cgood guys\u201d abusing our private information as well. After breaches of trust at Facebook led to private information being shared and abused by Cambridge Analytica and others, and Google was just fined more than $57 million USD for privacy violations under the GDPR regulation that went into effect last year, people and companies are on high alert when it comes to data privacy.\nCybersecurity Experts Weigh In\nI reached out to a number of IT professionals and cybersecurity experts to get their commentary and insight on Data Privacy Day, and their advice and tips for how you can do a better job of restricting access to information and protecting data:\nJadee Hanson, CISO for Code42\n\u201cWhen it comes time to protect data, it\u2019s important to understand that data privacy and data security go hand in hand. There\u2019s no way an organization can move into privacy controls around using and sharing data \u2013 and the notice and consent that comes with it \u2013 without a strong foundation of data security.\nWith a strong security foundation in place, companies can talk about the rules and principles of data privacy. They should begin by looking at the terms of data agreements on both sides \u2013 from both a company data and customer data perspective \u2013 and then layer on the standard privacy principles around use, notice, sharing, consent, transparency. These principles typically apply to different companies in different ways, so it\u2019s a good practice to work closely with legal teams on what and how privacy principles apply to different businesses. Of these standard principles, the concept of use is probably the most critical one. Companies need to clearly understand the rules around what data they can and can\u2019t use, and then be transparent about how they\u2019re using that data.\u201d\nSteve Blow, Tech Evangelist, Zerto\n\u201cAll businesses know by now that they need to prioritize data protection \u2013 there\u2019s certainly enough headline scare stories of data leaks, outages and ransomware attacks that should have persuaded them over the past year. Adding to this is the modern consumer perspective of \u2018there\u2019s no excuse for downtime, or the loss of data\u2019. Businesses need to be focusing on ensuring they are resilient against the many threats facing data today, to prove to their customers they are taking data protection seriously.\nThe adoption of the latest technology, with innovative new approaches, has led to this number of both planned and unplanned disruptions in a business rising. Combating this means companies need to start looking outside of traditional backup capabilities to keep the business online; they need to choose a modern, resilience approach that can utilize continuous data protection.\u201d\nJack Danahy, SVP, Security at Alert Logic\n\u201cThe remarkable immediacy of social media has created a deceptive kind of artificial intimacy between people and their devices. Communications feel very personal, very one-to-one, but they are really neither. Improving and ensuring privacy requires educating users about the risks and the natural exposures present in this environment, and we need to be constantly on the lookout for both accidental oversharing and intentional attempts to breach these growing confidences. Instead of attempting to isolate users from the rest of the internetworked community, it is time to empower them to share more knowingly and more safely.\u201d\nAli Golshan, CTO and co-founder at StackRox\n\u201cConsidering the volume and range of data being collected from services and users, targeting and reaching the user has become a very personal experience. We can clearly see the negative impacts of it in politics and American culture.\nAnalytic infrastructures allow for powerful insights into data, but they create compliance and security risks for companies because data is often dumped into data lakes without proper labeling, auditing, or policy enforcement. We are seeing companies such as Apple building trust with customers by providing visibility and transparency into how that data is used. Additionally, Europe's GDPR require all companies serving European citizens, regardless of the company\u2019s HQ location, to implement controls around data privacy.\u201d\nGary Watson, CTO of StorCentric and Founder of Nexsan\n\u201cThe notion of data protection might be starting to sound repetitive, but it is still top of the business agenda. IT security threats come in all different shapes and sizes, and just as quickly as we put up barriers, cyber criminals find new ways to break through. Businesses need to have confidence in their recovery strategy; relying alone on the traditional ways of backing up data is not sufficient. Organizations need to ensure everything is protected including the data, finances and the organization\u2019s reputation. Threat detection software is only half the battle, keep in mind \u2018what if any attack succeeds?\u2019 and ensure there is a second line of defense in place that can offer a comprehensive range of security features, from encryption through to backup, hardened archiving, and recovery. Alongside product investment, take the time to educate employees on the latest threats, which in turn will build confidence.\u201d\nHeather Paunet, Vice President of Product Management at Untangle\n\u201cData privacy has become a hot topic over the last few years, especially with the recent large-scale data breaches. It is important that organizations of all sizes take data privacy seriously and proactively ensure personally identifiable information (PII) is protected. Protecting data in the event of a breach is crucial to maintain the trust and respect of the public. Businesses can take some simple steps to protect the data they are collecting. Storing the private data on a network or server that is separate from the public, or even separate from the main corporate network, can provide an extra layer of protection. Encrypting the data, especially PII, is another standard practice to comply with a variety of regulations like PCI and HIPAA in the United States and GDPR in Europe. With GDPR in full effect, data privacy and transparency are now more relevant than ever. Businesses must realize that the GDPR rules are not a hindrance, but a chance to show consumers that they can trust them and that they are taking a proactive approach to data privacy.\u201d\nJoseph Carson, chief security scientist at Thycotic\n\u201cIs Data Privacy Day turning into Data Privacy Remembrance Day? Is it even reversible?The answer is yes. The end of privacy as we know it is closer than you may think. Privacy definitions are very different between nation states and cultures, however, one thing that is common is that privacy is becoming less and less of an option for most citizens. In public, almost everyone is being watched and monitored 24/7 with thousands of cameras using your expressions, fashion, walk, directions, interactions and speech to determine what you need, what you might be thinking, who you are going to meet, who is nearby and even algorithms that determine what your next action might be. All of this is used to help provide a custom experience unique to everyone as well as predict and prevent security threats. The term \u201cif you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear\u201d is quickly becoming reality and privacy and could certainly disappear in the near future. Can we ever regain back our privacy?\u201d\nSumming Up\nSolving data privacy is the tech equivalent of curing cancer or fixing world hunger. It is a huge problem with a dizzying array of factors and nuanced variables involved. As clich\u00e9 as it is, there is no one right answer. Companies need to do everything they can to safeguard data\u2014especially personal information from customers. Businesses that function in the economy of monitoring, collecting, and selling personal data on individuals should only do so with explicit consent and absolute transparency.\nAs ideal as that would be, it still wouldn\u2019t be a guarantee. Individual consumers still need to be vigilant about protecting their own data. Be careful about which companies you trust your privacy with. More importantly, invest the time and effort to understand the data security and privacy controls available to you and make sure you take steps to configure them to limit access and protect your data."

            "The CEO of cryptocurrency trading platform Binance Changpeng Zhao announced a demo of the platform\u2019s decentralized exchange in a tweet today, Aug. 9.\nIn a six-minute video attached to the tweet, Zhao presented a \u201ccasual, early, pre-offer\u201d demo of the decentralized exchange. The CEO said not \u201cto expect too much\u201d for now, adding that it currently does not have a graphical user interface:\nA first (rough, pre-alpha) demo of the Binance Decentralized Exchange (DEX), showing issuing, listing and trading of tokens. All cli based, no GUI yet. A small step for #BinanceChain, a big step for #binance. https://t.co/2aXkR0gclP \u2014 CZ (not giving crypto away) (@cz_binance) August 9, 2018\nZhao showed three essential features of the planned exchange, those being the creation, listing, and trading of tokens. As Zhao did not disclose the launch date, it remains to be seen when the exchange will be marketed and what volumes it will be able to handle.\nDecentralized exchanges are lauded as more secure than their centralized counterparts, which are more vulnerable to hacks. Decentralized platforms are set up in a manner which allows users to retain ownership of their coins using private keys. This solution reportedly prevents cryptocurrencies from being accumulated in one centralized \u201choneypot,\u201d or point of attack.\nEarlier this month, Binance bought Trust Wallet, an open source, anonymous, and decentralized wallet that supports Ethereum and over 20,000 different Ethereum-based tokens. Zhao then said that Binance plans to list Trust Wallet as a default wallet on its decentralized exchange.\nBinance, which moved its operations to Malta this spring, is the number one crypto exchange by trade volume, according to Coinmarketcap. In July, the exchange supported plans to create a blockchain-based bank with tokenized ownership. The future \u201cFounders Bank\u201d will reportedly be owned by digital token investors and be based in Malta, known for its robust and transparent crypto regulatory climate."

            "Wildfires have burned across tens of thousands of acres of parched terrain in Colorado, spurring thousands of evacuations and compelling officials to seal off a national forest from the public on Tuesday.\nSix wildfires were still active in the state, which has endured months of dry weather and little snowfall. The largest, in southwest Colorado, is known as the 416 fire because it was the 416th incident to be called in to emergency officials this year. As of Tuesday morning, it had consumed more than 23,000 acres on the edge of San Juan National Forest and was only about 15 percent contained, according to an interagency team. The authorities said they would keep the national forest closed until it receives \u201csufficient moisture to improve conditions.\u201d\nDetected at the beginning of the month, the fire has prompted evacuations of more than 2,160 residences so far and put residents of 500 other homes on notice for possible evacuation, according to the authorities. No deaths or injuries have been reported, officials said; residents have sought shelter in middle schools, and local officials fear tourists usually drawn to the region for the summer may not come."

            "For more than two decades, the R&B singer R. Kelly has been trailed by allegations of sexual misconduct. He was married to a young singer who turned out to be 15 years old. There were claims that he controlled women in a cultlike atmosphere. He was linked to an infamous sex tape. None of it meaningfully stood in his way.\nThen, on Friday in Chicago, after weeks of renewed scrutiny, Mr. Kelly was indicted.\nThe authorities accused him of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving four victims, three of whom were underage, according to the Cook County state\u2019s attorney, Kim Foxx. Aggravated criminal sexual abuse can carry a sentence of three to seven years in prison for each count. Mr. Kelly, whose real name is Robert Kelly, faces 10 of them.\n\u201cThis was 30 years in the making,\u201d said Jim DeRogatis, the music journalist who was among the first to document allegations against Mr. Kelly. The singer, 52, was tried on 14 counts of child pornography and ultimately acquitted in 2008.\nBut in the intervening years, the world around him has changed. The #MeToo movement has washed across the country. As the fallout from abuse by Catholic priests unspooled, statutes of limitations on the sexual acts involving children have been raised or, in states like Illinois, abolished altogether. Women who were afraid to come forward or who were not believed are increasingly being heard."

            "UKRAINE\nSergei Gapon, AFP | Ukrainian comedian and presidential candidate Volodymyr Zelenskiy reacts after the announcement of the first exit poll results in the second round of Ukraine's presidential election in Kiev on April 21, 2019.\nUkraine leapt into the unknown Monday after comedian Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president on promises of change but with just a vague blueprint of what he might do as leader.\nAdvertising Read more\nZelensky, whose previous political experience was playing the president on a TV show, crushed incumbent Petro Poroshenko in a stinging rebuke to the establishment fuelled by voters' anger over war with separatists and social injustice.\nUkrainians looked to the future with hope and anxiety after the performer took 73 percent of the vote on Sunday, according to nearly complete official results.\nZelensky at 41 will become Ukraine's youngest ever president when he is sworn into office by early June. It remained unclear Monday who would fill top positions in his governement, including prime minister.\nThe star of \"Servant of the People\", a sitcom now in its third season, has vowed to press ahead with the pro-European course set out by Poroshenko.\nBut he has also said he wants to improve ties with arch-enemy Russia.\nOn election night, however, he appeared to taunt the Kremlin when he told people in fellow post-Soviet countries that \"everything is possible.\"\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday it was \"too early to talk about President Putin congratulating Mr Zelensky, or about the possibility of working together.\"\nTies between Ukraine and Russia were shredded after a bloody uprising ousted a Kremlin-backed regime in 2014, prompting Moscow to annex Crimea and support insurgents in eastern Ukraine in a conflict that has claimed around 13,000 lives.\nPoroshenko pledges to return\nPoroshenko, 53, quickly conceded defeat and said he was ready to coach the successor.\nBut on Monday evening he told a rally he planned to take back the country's top job during the next presidential polls set for 2024.\nSeveral thousand supporters, who gathered outside the presidential offices, chanted they wanted him back \"in a year\".\n\"With God's help,\" Poroshenko replied.\n\"We will unite to secure our common victory in the near future.\"\nPoroshenko's faction has the most seats in the legislature and new parliamentary polls are due to be held in October.\nThe Ukrainian president has strong powers over defence, security and foreign policy but will need parliament backing to push through reforms.\nOn the streets of Kiev earlier Monday, many praised the elections as a fair and peaceful transfer of power after popular uprisings of 2004 and 2014.\n\"People showed that they want change,\" 28-year-old Karina told AFP.\n\"We had the most honest polls in the history of Ukraine,\" she added.\nZelensky shunned traditional campaign rallies, instead performing comedy gigs, and implied he would use the same unorthodox style to run the country of 45 million that depends on international aid.\nUS President Donald Trump and French leader Emmanuel Macron called the political novice to congratulate him, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel pledged support.\nG7 ambassadors said they looked forward to working closely with the new leader but also recognized the progress the country had made under Poroshenko since 2014.\nOSCE observers praised Ukraine's election as \"competitive and held with respect for fundamental freedoms\", while regretting that the campaigns were thin on substance.\n'Political honeymoon'\nThe Kremlin said it respected the choice of the people but questioned the legitimacy of the polls, noting that \"three million\" Ukrainian citizens living in Russia could not vote there.\nKiev refused to open polling stations at its diplomatic missions in Russia.\nZelensky has said that among his top priorities are securing the release of Ukrainians being held prisoner by Russia and rebooting moribund Western-brokered peace talks.\nBut many doubt the political neophyte will be able to stand up to Putin and revive the struggling economy.\nQuestions have also been raised over his close ties to Israel-based tycoon Igor Kolomoysky.\nVictoriya, a 74-year-old pensioner, said she liked the new president-elect but expressed concern that he may not last long.\n\"He has not met this pack of wolves yet,\" she said.\nAnalyst Volodymyr Fesenko said that Zelensky's political \"honeymoon\" would last two or three months before reality kicks in.\nUkrainians want to see a quick end to the war in the east and pay less for utility bills, Fesenko told AFP.\n\"It will be extremely difficult to meet these expectations,\" he said.\n(AFP)\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe"

            "Steve Dunlop\nThe week before the 2016 election, an anomaly in my work schedule made it necessary for me to drive from Pittsburgh to Toledo, Ohio \u2014 a distance of 233 miles \u2014 right through a part of the Rust Belt that would prove decisive in the race for president.\nIf I had flown between the two cities, I would have missed it. Along with the ghosts of factories, empty billboards, and weather-beaten barns, dozens of Trump-Pence signs were hammered into the fallow farmland by the roadside. Many of them were painted by hand, demonstrating the depth of feelings of those who had made them. That week, the smart money was still on Hillary Clinton. We all know how that turned out.\nSomething similar is happening with the grassroots movement to restore the Tappan Zee name to the new bridge across the Hudson. You can see it in the lawn signs that are popping up in hamlets near the span. You can hear it in the diners and at the gas pumps.\nThose who find no reason to revisit the \u201cGov. Mario M. Cuomo Bridge\u201d name have underestimated the intensity and breadth of growing public sentiment.\nA POLITICAL BRIDGE TOO FAR? Newly aligned bills would bring back 'Tappan Zee'\nUNBROKEN: Cuomo Bridge's second span gets connected\nCUOMO BRIDGE: How the governor claimed decades of planning as his own\nWhy is pressure growing now? For the same reason our state government has been so sclerotic for decades. The vast majority of New Yorkers don\u2019t pay attention.\nGov. Andrew Cuomo knows this well. A master of statecraft, he exploited that very somnolence when he snuck the name change at the close of the 2017 legislative session, then stuck it in the session-ending reconciliation session. He did it with no fanfare, and not even a token attempt to muster public support.\nHe did it because he could. And he could because no one was looking.\nBut the standard Albany playbook may not work this time. From the American Revolution to the Civil Rights movement, our country\u2019s history is replete with examples of passionate, well-organized groups of individuals who buck the odds and pull off an upset. That may be about to happen again.\nYou already know about the pending legislation to restore the name. Now consider the following:\nA number of area Democrats have told me they would vote \u201cyes\u201d on the bill if it gets to the floor in the Senate and Assembly.\nOn June 7, saveourtappanzee.org plans to deliver a petition to Albany with 110,000 signatures demanding that the original bridge name be restored.\nThe Orangetown Town Board passed a resolution May 15 in support of A8914A and S7671, legislation that seeks to add \u201cTappan Zee\u201d back to the bridge\u2019s name.\nThe Hudson Valley\u2019s genteel historical societies, for whom controversy has typically meant what type of finger sandwiches to serve at the garden party, also have supported legislation to add back \"Tappan Zee.\" Resolutions have been passed by the Historical Society of the Nyacks and the Historical Society of Rockland County, so far.\nTo Albany\u2019s powerbrokers, the opposition is an alien species.They must have no idea what to make of them. Their driving passion is \u2014 what? Not political, but historical? The political animals must be asking: What do they really want?\nIt\u2019s simple, actually. Just keep the historic Tappan Zee name, with roots going all the way back to the Tappan Indians who first inhabited our region, and the subsequent Dutch settlers (\u201cZee\u201d means \u201csea\u201d in Dutch).\nCuomo persists in viewing the issue through the same shopworn lens, claiming these newly minted activists are politically \u201crabid.\u201d But it is, in fact, the support for the \u201cGov. Mario M. Cuomo Bridge\u201d that is political in nature.\nNot unlike those struggling farmers in the Rust Belt, we New Yorkers are a busy, distracted people, mostly preoccupied with paying the bills. It\u2019s been part of our character ever since the Dutch established the location as a mercantile trading post. We really don\u2019t care much about Albany politics \u2014 until we do.\nFurther up the Hudson River, there\u2019s another famous character whose name is on a bridge: Rip Van Winkle. Just like him, we\u2019re awakening from a very long nap.\nThe writer, a Tappan resident, is a former New York City TV reporter and member of two Hudson Valley historical societies."

            "Politics & Government Photos: Patriot Prayer Rally In Seattle Meets Counterprotest The right-wing group Patriot Prayer held a pro-gun rally Saturday in Seattle. They were met with a large counter-protest. Reply\nSEATTLE, WA - Saturday's Patriot Prayer rally at Seattle City Hall pitted gun-toting Oath Keepers and Proud Boys against antifa and other left wing counterprotesters. The two sides were separated by 4th Avenue and plenty of Seattle police, but they were still able to taunt and shout at each other.\nThe rally began around 1 p.m. with Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson giving brief remarks. City Hall plaza was secured by police, but also dozens of armed men wearing homemade military-style gear. They forced some attendees to open their bags for security checks. Seattle police aided the security team by ejecting people who refused to be searched. The security was provided by the Oath Keepers and III% groups. A man from Eastern Washington who called himself \"A.D.\" was inside the rally wearing a Confederate flag on his head. He said he came to the rally to fight for gun rights. The rally was initially called to protest I-1639, a gun safety ballot initiative. A Thurston County judge on Friday blocked that initiative after a challenge brought by the National Rifle Association.\nAcross 4th Avenue from A.D., left wing protesters held up pictures of Heather Heyer, the woman killed by a white nationalist in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. A.D. said he wore the Confederate flag on his head because his family is from the south. \"I'm not a racist, I'm a lover of all,\" he said, underscoring that his family did not fight in the Civil War for slavery. \"I don't agree with owning slaves.\"\nCounter protesters invoked Heather Heyer, who died in August 2017 when a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd in Charlottesville, Virginia Men from the Oath Keepers and III% groups provided extra security. They dressed in homemade military garb and carried semiautomatic handguns. Angie True Fryar wore her friend's shirt to the rally. The friend, Thomas Sparks, said he bought the shirt for an event just like this one. A member of the Proud Boys wearing the signature black and yellow Fred Perry polo shirt One attendee implied that sexual harassment and sexual assault can be stopped by arming women with guns David, from Pierce County, said he came to protest \u201cleft wing violence.\u201d He was seated under a tent waving a large flag. He said he believed that the counterprotesters across the street were being paid to be there, a notion many on the right believe. David said he was concerned antifascist protesters would use slingshots and rocks to attack the Patriot Prayer rally.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why people can\u2019t get along,\u201d he said. David said he wants everyone to get behind Donald Trump. \"Can you imagine the good it would create if everyone stood behind the president?\" he said."

Harper headed in Coffey's cross but his celebrations were cut short after the referee adjudged the ball to have gone out of play.\nIn the end Rangers held out for glory as they gained revenge on the Hoops for the 3-0 defeat dished out in the same final two years ago."

            "Instagram Stories are about to get even busier, with the addition of licensed music. Starting today, users will be able to add background music to their posts on their Stories, with thousands of songs offered directly in the app (including actually popular music by artists like Bruno Mars, Demi Lovato, and Maroon 5). Instagram says new songs will be added daily.\nAdding songs to Stories works through Instagram\u2019s sticker feature, just like polls and sliders \u2014 you\u2019ll drag and drop in the new \u201cMusic\u201d sticker to your post, and select the perfect background music for whatever cool thing you\u2019re doing. Users will be able to then scrub through the song to get to the exact chunk of music they want playing for the particular video or image, too. Instagram had previously added deep linking to Spotify in Stories back at F8, but the new stickers go one step further by actually playing the music you\u2019ve chosen in the background.\nInstagram will also let users pick a song to play before they record a video too, which feels like a shot across the bow of the various lip-sync apps out there. Like with the sticker-based option, users will be able to pick a song using a new \u201cMusic\u201d option underneath the record button, find the snippet they want playing in the background, and then be able to record video as usual.\nAlong with the new soundtrack features, Instagram announced a new milestone for Stories, which the company says is now used by over 400 million users daily."

It's that waterway, with a drainage basin of 5,200 miles, that presents the most potential danger as it flows near large population centers in Fayetteville and Wilmington.\nOn Friday the river was at the 12-foot mark, but by 5 p.m. Monday it had reached 55 feet, 20 feet above minor flood stage. It was expected to peak at 62 feet Tuesday in Fayetteville. Downstream it would be higher.\nEven some residents who had experienced flooding from recent rains appeared little concerned about predicted river rises.\nMatthew is the point of comparison\nAs a measuring stick they used Hurricane Matthew, a storm that brought a 500-year flood in 2016 to the region.\nIn the Cedar Falls neighborhood west of downtown, waters had risen over streets, cutting off roads, swamping cars and flooding ground floors of some homes.\nAl Linthicum, 35, who bought a generator and supplies after water swept into his house two years ago, wasn't among those whose houses were flooded this year.\n\"Matthew was worse, for sure,\" said Linthicum who had bought a kayak that was used to visit some parts of the neighborhood.\nBut others said they knew of the warnings and were concerned.\nMichelle Brooks stood at the Cape Fear's edge near the Person Street Bridge, worrying over over her daughter in one of the neighborhoods threatened by flooding.\n\u201cI was around for the last flood, but this is supposed to be worse,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cMy daughter doesn\u2019t want to leave. She thinks it\u2019s over. But they keep saying it\u2019s not.\u201d"

If a leadership spill motion was then passed, he would not stand in the vote.\nWhoever emerges as Australia's next prime minister, they will become the country's sixth prime minister in less than a decade. None of those, which includes two stints for former Labor leader Kevin Rudd, have served a full term in office.\n\"Australians will be rightly appalled by what they are witnessing in their parliament,\" Mr Turnbull told reporters in Canberra.\nHe said the leadership crisis was an \"internal insurgency\" to move the Liberal party to the far right.\nMr Turnbull came to power in a party-room coup in September 2015.\nA social liberal and multi-millionaire former merchant banker, he has struggled to appeal to conservative voters and only narrowly won an election in 2016.\nThe ruling Liberal-National coalition government has consistently trailed the opposition Labor party in opinion polls, but Mr Turnbull has remained the voters' preferred prime minister over Labor leader Bill Shorten.\nMr Shorten said the \"cannibalistic behaviour\" over the Liberal leadership was eating the government alive.\n\"Australia no longer has a functioning government,\" he told parliament."

So that was one factor in Rolls getting the fight,\u201d said Tom Loeffler, the managing director of GGG Promotions. \u201cBut they also liked that he is undefeated and that he is a hungry fighter.\u201d\nRolls has been one of the finalists, alongside Hassan N\u2019Dam, since first choice Brandon Adams elected to face Jermall Charlo. We know all about Golovkin (38-1-1, 34 KO), so let\u2019s talk about Steve.\nRolls (19-0, 10 KO) is a 35-year-old who\u2019s spent at least some time at the legendary Kronk Gym and bounced between middleweight and super middleweight since his 2011 debut. He\u2019s had one appearance on a major stage, narrowly edging Demond Nicholson on a 2017 ShoBox card, and defeated KeAndrae Leatherwood last December in his first 10-rounder.\nRolls is easily the worst of Golovkin\u2019s four major options, which included the three mentioned above and unbeaten Pole Kamil Szeremeta. BoxRec has him 94th in the division and 4th among Canadian middleweights. For reasons unknown to me, however, the IBF has him at #9 and Golovkin at #10.\nBut hey, he does have a two-inch reach advantage, so what do I know?"

            "Coca-Cola Co. says it's monitoring the cannabis drinks business and is interested in drinks infused with CBD -- the non-psychoactive ingredient in marijuana that treats pain but doesn't get you high. (Seth Perlman / AP)\nThe world's largest beverage company may be the next industry giant to jump into the cannabis drinks business.\nCoca-Cola Co. says it's monitoring the nascent industry and is interested in drinks infused with CBD -- the non-psychoactive ingredient in marijuana that treats pain but doesn't get you high. The Atlanta-based soft drinks maker is in talks with Canadian marijuana producer Aurora Cannabis Inc. to develop the beverages, according to a report from BNN Bloomberg Television.\nAdvertisement\n\"We are closely watching the growth of non-psychoactive CBD as an ingredient in functional wellness beverages around the world,\" Coca-Cola spokesman Kent Landers said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg News. \"The space is evolving quickly. No decisions have been made at this time.\" Landers declined to comment on Aurora.\nPot stocks Tilray Inc., Cronos Group and Canopy Growth gained in pre-market trading Monday in response to Coca-Cola's interest. Tilray jumped 6.8 percent, adding to its 40 percent gain last week; Cronos rose 3.1 percent and Canopy's U.S. shares climbed 2.9 percent.\nAdvertisement\nCoke's possible foray into the marijuana sector comes as beverage makers are trying to add cannabis as a trendy ingredient while their traditional businesses slow. Last month, Corona beer brewer Constellation Brands Inc. announced it will spend $3.8 billion to increase its stake in Canopy Growth Corp., the Canadian marijuana producer with a value that exceeds C$13 billion ($10 billion).\nMolson Coors Brewing Co. is starting a joint venture with Quebec's Hydropothecary Corp. to develop cannabis drinks in Canada. Diageo, maker of Guinness beer, is holding discussions with at least three Canadian cannabis producers about a possible deal, BNN Bloomberg reported last month. Heineken's Lagunitas craft-brewing label has launched a brand specializing in non-alcoholic drinks infused with THC, marijuana's active ingredient.\nCoca-Cola has already been diversifying as consumption of soda continues to decline. The company, with its iconic brands ranging from Coke and Sprite to Powerade, announced it will acquire the Costa Coffee chain for $5.1 billion in August, and has expanded into other products including juice, tea and mineral water over the past decade.\nThe discussions with Aurora are focused on CBD-infused drinks to ease inflammation, pain and cramping, according to the BNN Bloomberg report. CBD, or cannabidiol, is the chemical in the pot plant often used for medicinal purposes, and doesn't produce the high that comes from THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol. There are no guarantees of any deal between Aurora and Coca-Cola, according to the report.\nHeather MacGregor, a spokeswoman for Aurora, said in an emailed statement that the cannabis producer has expressed specific interest in the infused-beverage space, and intends to enter that market, BNN Bloomberg's David George-Cosh reported.\nWhile marijuana remains illegal at the national level in the U.S., there is growing acceptance of the use of CBD derived from marijuana to treat illnesses ranging from chronic pain to anxiety and epilepsy. The first-ever medical treatment derived from a marijuana plant will hit the U.S. market soon, after regulators in June gave an epilepsy treatment by GW Pharmaceuticals the green light.\nAurora is Canada's third-largest pot company, with a market value of C$8.7 billion. The Edmonton, Alberta-based company has soared along with other pot stocks in Canada as the country gears up to become the first Group of Seven nation to legalize cannabis on Oct. 17. The BI Canada Cannabis Competitive Peers Index has more than doubled in the past 12 months, though has dropped 24 percent in 2018 on concern that the stocks are overvalued."

            "The juggernaut is rolling at full speed, and the Golden State Warriors are looking about as good as they ever have. After a couple of softer opponents, the Warriors tested their mettle against a very good Boston Celtics team. Now, fresh off their four-point win in Boston on Saturday, the Warriors head into Indiana to take on the Pacers in the final game of this road trip.\nGame Details\nWHO: Golden State Warriors (35-15) at Indiana Pacers (32-16)\nWHEN: Monday, January 28; 4 p.m.\nWHERE: Bankers Life Fieldhouse \u2014 Indianapolis, IN\nWATCH: NBCSBA, NBA TV\nRADIO: 95.7 The Game\nBlog buddy: Indy Cornrows\nA team without their star\nVictor Oladipo was having a breakout year while leading the surprising Indiana Pacers to the third seed in the East. He led the team in scoring with nearly 19 points per game and was near the top for the team in both rebounds (5.6) and assists (5.2) ...so losing him sucks. In case you missed it, he went down just two games ago on a non-contact play \u2014 the diagnosis is not good and he\u2019s done for the season.\nOne of my favorite parts about sports in general, and the NBA specifically, is that once a player gets injured, everyone is immediately rooting for them hard! Here\u2019s Demarcus Cousins, talking about injuries and how hard these men have to work to get back on the court.\nDeMarcus Cousins just went through a grueling rehab. He feels for Victor Oladipo: \u201cWe put our bodies through so much in the NBA. I feel like it\u2019s undervalued.\u201d pic.twitter.com/dEvFErmrzY \u2014 Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) January 27, 2019\nWithout Oladipo, the third place Pacers are assumed to begin an inexorable slide back down the standings. How far and how fast they slide will be determined by how well the remaining players are able to step up and fill the void left by Oladipo\u2019s unfortunate disappearance. They have got some options though.\nThad Young, a player many Warriors fans have been keeping tabs on for years, will step up \u2014 as will Bojan Bogdanovic and Darren Collison \u2014 but will it be enough? Probably not against a Warriors team that is firing on all cylinders. But Oladipo and his injury have redefined the entire Pacers season and I assume they are now somewhat in need of a moral victory or two. A close game against this Warriors squad is probably what they\u2019re aiming for tonight.\nCan the Warriors keep winning?\nNo strangers to record-setting hot streaks, Golden State finds themselves well positioned to reel off a nice streak of wins here. Already at ten straight, the Warriors haven\u2019t lost a game since that squeaker they dropped to the Houston Rockets back on January 3rd.\nThe upcoming schedule is not without danger \u2014 and of course anyone can lose on any given night \u2014 but after this Pacers game, the Warriors have a lot of very winnable games on the horizon.\nInterestingly, while the team\u2019s league-leading offense is continuing to climb, so is the defense. Once a perennial top defensive squad, the Warriors now rank 15th in team defensive efficiency. As Brady would say \u201cdecidedly mediocre.\u201d\nOne element to pay attention to: Demarcus Cousins\u2019 foul rate. Right now, the big man is averaging just over four fouls per game, which pro-rates to more than seven fouls per 36 minutes of action. Yes, he is recovering from a severe lower leg injury and hasn\u2019t played real basketball in over a year, but fouling like this is unsustainable.\nAgainst the Boston Celtics on Saturday, Cousins picked up five fouls in just 23 minutes. While the team doesn\u2019t really need him for much more time than that, the abundant fouls can lead to all sorts of problems by putting the other team in the bonus, screwing up our rotations or getting other players in their own heads worried about adding more fouls to the pile.\nBoston was the first real test for Cousins. The Pacers may not be quite on par with the Celtics after losing their best player, but they do have a number of good big men that they\u2019ll be using. Right now, the Warriors aren\u2019t too worried about all these fouls, but as the season moves along, at some point, this is going to become a discussion."

            "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump surprised Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, on Wednesday by abruptly announcing that Mr. McGahn will be leaving his job this fall, effectively forcing the long-anticipated exit of a top adviser who has cooperated extensively in the investigation into Russian election interference.\nThe president made the declaration on Twitter without first informing Mr. McGahn, according to people close to both men. It came 11 days after The New York Times reported the degree to which Mr. McGahn \u2014 who was by Mr. Trump\u2019s side at major moments as the president sought to keep control of the Russia inquiry \u2014 has emerged as a key witness in the investigation. Over the past nine months Mr. McGahn has given 30 hours of testimony in at least three voluntary interviews.\nMr. McGahn\u2019s departure leaves the White House without one of the few senior advisers who have been willing to push back against Mr. Trump. It also raised the prospect of further West Wing exits, particularly in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office, where Mr. McGahn has had a loyal staff, with several people staying in their jobs out of devotion to him.\nMr. McGahn had long discussed his intention to leave at some point, but the way Mr. Trump blindsided him with a tweet underscored how dysfunctional the relationship had become, even as the Russia inquiry appears to be reaching a critical phase, and the legal scrutiny is mounting for the president."

According to independent.ie , he received six different sentences of eight years in prison, all of which will run concurrently.\nThe Irish man was also registered as a sex offender and was fined $10,000 for one of the three Improper Relationships.\nThe 25 year old had travelled to Texas on a soccer scholarship and worked as a football coach and social studies teach in a Texas high school from 2015 to 2016 when the offences occured.\nSpeaking about the Welfare of their students, school superintendent, Dr. Alexandro M. Flores told local news station, KAVU-TV: \"At no point during his tenure here were we made aware of any inappropriate interactions between Mr. Gaffney and any of our students. Regardless of our district\u2019s best efforts to thoroughly vet and screen all incoming employees, we cannot ultimately predict the future behaviors or actions to be displayed by our staff.\"\n\"What we can tell you with certainty is that we will always follow up and investigate any claims, allegations, or reports regarding inappropriate contact of any kind between staff and students and will not hesitate to take immediate and effective action when necessary and warranted. Unfortunately, we live in a time where these kinds of incidents can occur anywhere, even in smaller rural districts such as our own.\"\n\"No one is truly immune. Please be aware that we are fully cooperating with authorities and their investigation regarding this matter. The safety and security of our students will always remain the top priority of our organization and we will continue to work tirelessly to improve upon any best practices which support and increase the safety of our children.\""

            "We're right in the middle of sick season. It's prime time to get struck by a viral or bacterial illness like tonsillitis, which can leave you feeling rotten and out of action for up to a week or two.\nBut if your sore throat is lingering, you may want to pay a little more attention to it.\nNew scientific research led by the University of Exeter and published in the British Journal of General Practice concludes that GPs seeing patients with persistent hoarse throats should consider whether it could be a symptom of something more serious, like laryngeal cancer.\nThe larynx is the part of the throat located at the top of the windpipe, and helps you to breathe and speak.\nThis content is imported from {embed-name}. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\nThe study assessed patients diagnosed with cancer of the larynx alongside a number of control patients, and found that a key symptom was a consistently sore throat - but only when paired with other ailments. Such symptoms include shortness of breath, trouble swallowing and earache.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Cancer Research UK said the information shouldn't scare people, but should inform them about what to pay attention to. \"A sore throat on its own wasn't linked to laryngeal cancer,\" a spokesperson reassured.\nProfessor Willie Hamilton, who co-authored the study, noted that its findings could be important because they indicate \"the potential severity of some symptom combinations previously thought to be low risk.\"\nGetty Images\nAnd he's right. A sore throat or an earache on their own aren't things we'd necessarily panic about - and that should continue to be the case. But if the symptoms persist, and you note they occur in conjunction with one another, it's best to get yourself checked out just in case something more serious could be at plat.\nThe UK sees around 2,000 diagnoses of laryngeal cancer each year, however it's proven to be more common in men. The disease is also thought to have strong links to smoking and drinking alcohol.\nRead more about laryngeal cancer and its symptoms over on Cancer Research's website.\nFollow Cat on Twitter."

            "The 2019 Ford Ranger isn't even on sale yet, but if an alleged leak turns out to be true, we've already got a good idea of just how many accessories future Ranger owners can dump money into.\nA post on the Ranger5G forum claims to have a leaked list of accessories for the 2019 Ford Ranger. The list is positively voluminous, covering a wide variety of accessories for the bed, exterior, interior, electronics and trailering. The prices are merely suggested retail prices, so if the list turns out to be 100 percent accurate, the pricing may still vary in your neck of the woods.\nLooking for something as simple as an ashtray that doubles as a coin holder? You're covered. Want some rails for your bed, in addition to a bedliner, a tailgate lock and a storage box? Ford's got it all. Need a beefy security system? The catalog has that, too.\nBut the most interesting corner of the catalog has to be the exterior accessories section. In addition to small stuff like window deflectors and chrome exhaust tips, there are some particularly gnarly upgrades. You can slap an ARB bull bar on the front, or widen the whole body by way of fender flares. There are also carriers galore, so you can attach your bikes, canoes or whatever without eating up all the space in the bed.\nYou can head over to Ranger5G to see the whole list for yourself. If anything, it'll make the beginnings of one wicked holiday wish list.\n(Hat tip to Autoblog!)"

The Aggies' defense is getting stops, now they just need the offense to put some points on the board.\nIt hasn't taken very long for some Clemson fans to start calling for a change at the quarterback position.\nSome want true freshman Trevor Lawrence to be put into the game. The first-year QB was a five-star recruit coming out of high school.\nYahoo!

He's comfortable using him early and won't hesitate to do so,\" he tweets.\nDabo has already said that he's likely going to play both Kelly Bryant and Trevor Lawrence.\n\"We definitely will play both quarterbacks,\" Swinney told reporters this week. \"There's no doubt about that. Nothing happened [against Furman] to warrant not playing both those guys.\"\nSwinney didn't give more details than that, though.\n\"We'll see as the week [of practice] goes,\" Swinney told ESPN. \"I won't lay out what our plan is before the game. You like to have a little secrecy as to your plan. But I'll tell you both of them are going to play.\"\nLawrence threw for 137 yards and 3 touchdowns in the season-opening win.

            "Adidas has long been committed to the fight against single-use plastics. Since 2015, it has partnered with Parley for the Oceans to respond to the plastic pollution crisis threatening marine life. In June, Adidas CEO Kasper Rorsted announced the company had sold one million shoes made from plastic collected and recycled from the oceans.\nNow, the company is stepping up that commitment with a vow to use only recycled plastics in all its products by 2024, CNN Money reported Monday.\nThis means the company will also abandon new polyester, a popular sportswear material that makes up around 50 percent of the material in Adidas products, Adidas global brands head Eric Liedtke told The Financial Times, according to The Huffington Post.\n\u201cWe aim to use 100% recycled polyester in every product and on every application where a solution exists by 2024,\u201d Adidas spokeswoman Maria Culp wrote in a statement to The Huffington Post.\nTo start, the company\u2019s 2019 spring and summer line will contain around 41 percent recycled polyester, Culp said.\nThe company will also phase out \u201cvirgin\u201d plastic from offices, warehouses, distribution centers and retail locations in a move expected to save 40 tons of plastic per year beginning in 2018, CNN Money reported.\nAdidas already replaced plastic bags in stores with paper ones in 2016, according to The Huffington Post.\nThe company now also hopes to increase sales of its ocean-plastic shoes to 5 million in 2018, CNN Money reported.\nThe announcement comes amid growing backlash to the proliferation of plastic in the natural environment. Last week, Starbucks announced a ban on plastic straws and two Australian states began July with the implementation of a plastic bag ban in major retailers.\nPlastic use has increased by 20 times in the last 50 years and is projected to double again in the next 20, but only 14 percent of it is collected to be recycled, according to CNN Money.\nHead of \u201cDetox My Fashion\u201d at Greenpeace Kirsten Brodde said that Adidas\u2019 announcement was a step in the right direction, but did not go far enough to address the waste endemic to the fashion industry.\n\u201cTo truly be sustainable, companies like Adidas need to produce less, more durable and repairable products,\u201d Brodde told The Huffington Post. \u201cTo solve our plastic waste problem, we need to stop producing so much plastic from the start, and in order to make fashion more sustainable, rethink a fashion system that hypes new trends every week.\u201d"

        "articles": [
            "The Trump administration is preparing a new rule that would punish legal immigrants who use health and nutrition programs like Medicaid or food stamps. It would make it harder for them to get green cards or citizenship, if they have used any of a long list of safety net programs, even temporarily.\nWe've heard legitimate concerns about people coming over here with no means to support themselves and becoming a burden on the American taxpayer. We can't throw our doors open to everyone who gets cancer in China or Mexico. But consider the impact on the ground. Three things are appalling about this, even for a fiscal conservative who favors restricting immigration.\nFirst, this rule applies to legal immigrants. Those who are here illegally are already banned from virtually all federal anti-poverty programs. That's right - despite Trump's rhetoric about people \"sneaking into the country,\" this is about denying care to someone who comes here legitimately for work, plays by all the rules, and then gets sick or falls on hard times.\nOnly whites need apply for citizenship? Trump now targets legal immigrants | Opinion\nThe second thing to understand is that most of the victims, by far, will be children; millions of whom are U.S. citizens. This is thanks to an entirely predictable chilling effect. Legal-immigrant parents, not up on the minutia of Trump policy, will be afraid to seek out benefits for not only themselves, but for their children who independently qualify.\nThey will forgo putting food in their kids' bellies and taking them to the doctor. Pregnant moms won't seek out checkups, for fear of jeopardizing their future legal status. This is happening already, local clinics say. And the confusion is deliberate. An earlier, harsher draft of this rule would have penalized immigrants not only for seeking out aid themselves, but for anyone in their household who did so.\nAmping-up this fear of interactions with the government, and discouraging use of these programs, is a calculated strategy by the Trump administration. And it's not only cruel. It could run up long term costs if kids and parents don't get adequate benefits, especially medical care. An untreated ear infection could lead to a serious and expensive illness.\nAnother reason this is bad fiscal policy: According to a report from the National Academy of Sciences, the public aid these immigrants get is typically short term, and the economic benefits they give our country kick in after that. Their reliance on safety net programs is most likely temporary, given that they are almost all working.\nSo whatever debt they run up during difficult times will be paid back in the long run. A government report commissioned, and then suppressed, by the Trump administration found the same of refugees. This is the problem with the idea that an immigrant who uses a safety net benefit at any time, or might do so in the future, is a \"public charge,\" as Trump's expansive proposal states.\nAs Shawn Fremstad from the Center for American Progress put it, \"What we need is a balanced immigration system that doesn't discriminate on the basis of class, rather than one in which you have to be Melania.\" Otherwise, we'll have trouble filling certain crucial but low-paying jobs, like caring for children or the elderly, which props up the higher earners in our economy.\nTrump's new policy is not just mean, it's bad economics. It reveals, too, that his administration - led by smug xenophobe Stephen Miller - just doesn't want more immigrants to dilute white America, even those who play by the rules that they are always touting. Because, in reality, it's not about who is \"legal.\" It's about dictating who gets to be an American.\nBookmark NJ.com/Opinion. Follow on Twitter @NJ_Opinion and find NJ.com Opinion on Facebook."

The show won 10 awards in all, including best musical, best actress in a musical for Katrina Lenk and best featured actor in a musical for Ari\u2019el Stachel.\nIn his acceptance speech, Shalhoub spoke of his immigrant father, Joe, who was 8 years old when he came to Ellis Island in 1920 on a boat from Lebanon.\n\u201cTonight, I celebrate him and all of those whose family journeyed before him and with him and after him. And I feel that this extremely generous gesture of yours honors not only their aspirations, their courage, their resourcefulness and their creativity and their selflessness,\u201d he said, becoming emotional.\n\u201c\u2026 May we, their descendants, never lose sight of what they taught us.\u201d\nAND THE TONYS WENT TO \u2026 Winners in major categories at Sunday night's Tony Awards: Best musical: \"The Band's Visit\" Best play: \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Parts One and Two\" Best revival of a musical: \"Once on This Island\" Best revival of a play: \"Angels in America\" Best lead actress in a musical: Katrina Lenk, \"The Band's Visit\" Best lead actor in a musical: Tony Shalhoub, \"The Band's Visit\" Best lead actress in a play: Glenda Jackson, \"Edward Albee's Three Tall Women\" Best lead actor in a play: Andrew Garfield, \"Angels in America\" Best featured actress in a musical: Lindsay Mendez, \"Rodgers & Hammerstein's Carousel\" Best featured actor in a musical: Ari'el Stachel, \"The Band's Visit\" Best featured actress in a play: Laurie Metcalf, \"Edward Albee's Three Tall Women\" Best featured actor in a play: Nathan Lane, \"Angels in America\"\nWhen he addressed the press backstage after the win, Shalhoub talked about an event from his childhood that played a major role in his love for theater.\nHe was 6 and was recruited by his older sister, Susan Shalhoub Larkin, to be among the children who performed in her high school production of \u201cThe King and I.\u201d During dress rehearsal, as Act I ended with a number by the children, he somehow found himself the only child on the outside of the curtain when it came down. There was laughter, and even more when he couldn\u2019t find the opening in the curtains to get off the stage.\nHe burst into tears, he said.\n\u201cIt has just been one humiliation after another since then,\u201d he joked. \u201cBut maybe that laughter was kind of like a bug burrowed into my system. It hooked me forever, I think.\u201d\nOther nominees with Wisconsin ties didn't fare as well.\nRELATED:Wisconsin makes strong show; Tony Shalhoub, Mark Rylance and Ayad Akhtar among Tony Award nominees\nMark Rylance, who's won three Tonys and an Academy Award, was nominated for best actor in a play for \"Farinelli and the King,\" but lost to Andrew Garfield, who won for his performance in the revival of Tony Kushner's \"Angels in America.\"\nPulitzer Prize winner and Brookfield Central High School alum Ayad Akhtar, nominated for best play for \"Junk,\" lost to the night's other big winner, \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Parts One and Two,\" which took home six Tonys in all.\nBonus local angle at Sunday's Tonys: Rachel Brosnahan, the Milwaukee native who won a Golden Globe for her performance on Amazon's \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\" introduced the musical number performed from \"The Band's Visit,\" \"Omar Sharif.\" The connection: Shalhoub plays Brosnahan's father on \"Mrs. Maisel.\"\nBut the night's biggest moment wasn't about giving or getting a Tony. After the telecast acknowledged that Melody Herzfeld \u2014 a drama teacher at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida who had kept her students safe in a classroom during the massacre that left 17 people dead \u2014 had received the awrad for excellence in theater education, Herzfeld's students took the stage and sang a stirring rendition of \u201cSeasons of Love,\u201d from \u201cRent.\u201d\nThe Green Bay Press Gazette's Kendra Meinert contributed to this report."

Amma dropped the feelings she was harboring towards Camille, and there was an actual progression in their relationship.\nAs for Adora and Camille, there's no way they'll ever be able to make things right. Adora has never loved Camille, and we didn't need her to confirm as much to her face.\nHell, to the media it was like Camille did not exist all those years ago.\nMarian was front and center during every family event before her death.\nRelated: Game of Thrones: HBO Boss Narrows Down Premiere Date\nThis is a horrible thing to say, but it would make for a great \"What If?\" episode if we got to see how Adora would have reacted if Camille died instead of Marian.\nI dare say she would not be as cut up about it.\nWe got yet more insight into the character of Kirk. I thought there was something off about him on Sharp Objects Season 1 Episode 4 when Amma touched his hand.\nWe now know that Camille had a sexual encounter with Kirk several years ago. There's a popular theory doing the rounds that Camille could be Amma's mother, and it would not surprise me.\nAdora could have forced Camille to give up the rights to her daughter and even covered up her being the mother altogether. Adora is cunning and knows how to pull the wool over the people of Wind Gap.\nIt's a sound theory that could ring true, but it raises the question about who Amma's father could be. Kirk may have wanted to meet with Camille, but it looked like there were a lot of painful memories brought back when he addressed Camille.\nCould that pain be that he is Amma's father? It certainly looks that way.\nIt wouldn't be a city gathering without some fighting, and it was only a matter of time before Tom and Bob went at it. Like I've said on multiple occasions, even if a person is deemed innocent after being arrested for a crime, there's always an element of doubt that follows the person around for the rest of their life.\nDid anyone else hate Adora showing Richard the house? It was like she wanted Camille to worry about what was being said, and why would Camille not worry?\nHer past is dark, full of mischief, and most of all, horror. Poor Camille likely thought Richard was going to get the heck out of dodge upon hearing about her.\nRelated: Sharp Objects Season 1 Episode 4 Review: Ripe\nThen there's Bob. Bob is pissed at the way the investigation is going. Vickery and Richard are no closer to finding the killer than they were on Sharp Objects Season 1 Episode 1.\nThe killer is smart and does not leave any sort of evidence, meaning that they've researched the heck out of every aspect of the killing game.\nAshley not being impressed with the article was tough luck. In today's world, not everything makes the cut when articles go live. Some quotes get lost in translation to create a narrative.\nThat's the way the cookie crumbles, but at least Camille knew how to handle her.\nOne person who continues to sketch me out is Jackie. Every single time I hear \"Camille Preaker\" I roll my eyes because it means we are in for another awkward meeting.\nThe good thing about Jackie is that she and Camille have very similar outlooks on the way things are run in Wind Gap. They are against it, and Jackie strives to defy orders.\nWe need to know more about her and fast. There are just three episodes left, and we need to get answers before this series concludes for good.\nOkay, Sharp Objects Fanatics!\nWhat are your thoughts on this episode?

            "MVP Player\u2019s Predictions\nBlizzard\u2019s The Overwatch League has managed to attract a huge following online, where Twitch viewer counts have been astronomical, but you will soon be able to watch the esports action on a very familiar sports channel: ESPN.\nDisney \u2014 the parent company of ESPN \u2014 and Blizzard made the announcement Wednesday, July 11, revealing that in addition to the main ESPN station, The Overwatch League matches will be broadcast on ESPN2, ABC, and Disney XD. The latter channel is no stranger to gaming content, as its Disney XP programming block last summer featured competitive gaming as well as more in-depth programs like The IGN Show.\nSo, when will you be able to start watching The Overwatch League on television? It actually begins tonight, when the playoffs kick off. The deal also includes the grand finals, the Overwatch World Cup in the fall, and The Overwatch League\u2019s second season.\n\u201cClearly by the way we\u2019re going to be covering it, starting with the playoffs and the finals this year, certainly speaks volumes to our excitement and our enthusiasm overall for esports moving forward,\u201d ESPN Vice President of Digital Media Programming John Lasker said in a statement.\nAs esports have become more mainstream, there has been less pushback regarding their place alongside more traditional sports on networks such as ESPN. Former ESPN personality Colin Cowherd was among the most vocal opponents, taking issue with Blizzard\u2019s Heroes of the Storm being played on ESPN2 back in 2015. His former SportsNation co-host Michelle Beadle had a much different response, becoming enthusiastic about the game despite her initial lack of interest.\nThe International Olympic Committee is scheduled to host an esports forum in Switzerland later this month to discuss the possibility of video games becoming an Olympic event. They would potentially be added to the Olympics for 2024, but only non-violent video games will be eligible. This means we won\u2019t be seeing any games like Overwatch or Heroes of the Storm. It\u2019s possible virtual sports series such as FIFA or Madden will be on display, instead, but we would love to see someone take home a gold medal for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.\nEditors' Recommendations"

See the list as released by the White House.\nThat list includes Don Willett, a former Texas Supreme Court justice who has mocked the president on Twitter, and Sen.

            "Sarah Henstra has won the 2018 Governor General's Literary Award for fiction for her novel The Red Word, a murky and twisted story about sexual assault on a college campus that the jury called \"an utterly effing good read.\"\nThe Governor General's Literary Awards, one of Canada's oldest and most prestigious prizes, annually acknowledge seven English-language and seven French-language books across several categories. Each winner receives $25,000.\nIn addition to The Red Word, the English-language winners of the 2018 Governor General's Literary Awards are:\nVisit Radio-Canada to find out the French-language winners.\nOn Nov. 29, 2018, the winners will gather in Ottawa to perform readings and sign their books for the public.\nEach year, in partnership with the Canada Council for the Arts, CBC Books publishes a commissioned series featuring original writing from winners of the Governor General's Literary Awards. This year's series will reflect on the theme Borders: lines that, when crossed or tampered with, mark a change. A companion radio episode will air on CBC Radio's Ideas in December.\nLast year's series was Chaos & Control and featured original writing from Joel Thomas Hynes, Cherie Dimaline, Richard Harrison, David A. Robertson and other winners.\nKeep reading to learn more about each of the 2018 English-language winners.\nThe Red Word is Sarah Henstra's first work of adult fiction. (Grove Press, ECW Press)\nSarah Henstra's novel The Red Word follows Karen, a college sophomore whose closest friends and roommates \u2014 a group of strong-willed intellectual feminists \u2014 are at odds with her fraternity brother boyfriend. Karen loves the cerebral debates she has at home with her roommates, as well as the raucous parties at her boyfriend's fraternity house. Caught up in both worlds, Karen inadvertently becomes part of her roommates's elaborate plan to expose rape culture at the fraternity and is haunted by the outcome.\n\"Groundbreaking and provocative, this is an astonishing evisceration of the clich\u00e9s of sexual politics as they exist not only on our college campuses, but also within broader present-day society. Alternately heartbreaking, funny, and critical, no one gets off easily. The Red Word plumbs the depths of literature, mythology, history, philosophy, and a host of contemporary issues \u2014 an utterly effing good read,\" said jurors Andrea MacPherson, Shani Mootoo and Craig Francis Power in a press release.\nDarrel McLeod is the author of Mamaskatch. (Ilja Herb, Douglas & McIntyre)\nDarrel McLeod's Mamaskatch is a memoir of his chaotic childhood and coming-of-age, mostly spent in the care of his fierce Cree mother, Bertha. McLeod describes vivid memories of moose stew and wild peppermint tea, surrounded by siblings, cousins, aunts and uncles. Though he experienced racism and abuse from non-Indigenous teachers, students and caregivers, McLeod learned from his mother, a residential school survivor, to be proud of his heritage.\n\"Mamaskatch: A Cree Coming of Age dares to immerse readers in provocative contemporary issues including gender fluidity, familial violence, and transcultural hybridity. A fast-moving, intimate memoir of dreams and nightmares \u2014 lyrical and gritty, raw and vulnerable, told without pity, but with phoenix-like strength,\" said the jury members, Ted Bishop, Leslie Shimotakahara and Merrily Weisbord, in a press release.\nCecily Nicholson is an award-winning poet from Vancouver, B.C. (Liam Britten/CBC/Talonbooks)\nCecily Nicholson takes a researched look at the landscape of the African diaspora in this poetic account of economy travel on Canadian and U.S. roadways. Crossing bridges and passing through tunnels in the Great Lakes region and beyond, Nicholson explores how migration, trauma and her own family history were shaped by transportation infrastructure and geography.\n\"In this hypnotic suite of long poems, Cecily Nicholson makes room, offering glimpses and echoes of the Canadian landscape as she explores ideas of borders, identity, industry and travel. She offers a catalogue of impressions, a collage of the ephemeral, held together by image and the pulsing phrase that stays with you long after the journey's over,\" said the jury, Garry Gottfriedson, Sachiko Murakami and Patrick Warner, in a press release.\nYoung people's literature \u2014 text: Sweep by Jonathan Auxier\nJonathan Auxier is the author of Sweep. (Puffin Canada)\nSet in Victorian London, Sweep revolves around a young orphan girl named Nan who sweeps chimneys for a dangerous and hardscrabble living. Nan nearly perishes in a deadly chimney fire, but is saved when a piece of charcoal comes to life as a mysterious golem-like creature. Together, the two hatch a plan to rescue young orphan chimney sweeps from losing their lives on the job for cruel masters.\n\"A tender story of what makes us human, Sweep doesn't shy away from the risks of love and monstrousness of indifference. With an impeccable narrative, Sweep shows how love can breathe life into darkness and how hope can spark change. Auxier weaves a multi-layered masterpiece with endearing characters and gut-wrenching twists that are certain to instill readers with a sense of wonder and discovery for the miracle of storytelling,\" said the jury, Shelley Hrdlitschka, Philip Roy and Sarah Tsiang, in a press release.\nYoung people's literature \u2014 illustrated books: They Say Blue by Jillian Tamaki\nThey Say Blue is Jillian Tamaki's first picture book. (Groundwood, Reynard Li)\nA vibrant picture book by Jillian Tamaki, They Say Blue is an exploration of colour told from the perspective of a curious and inquisitive little girl. In 2014, Tamaki won a Governor General's Literary Award for her work illustrating the graphic novel This One Summer, which was written by her cousin, Mariko Tamaki.\n\"They Say Blue is a wonderful blend of words and art, a sweeping, joyous book from cover to cover. Its lively and dynamic compositions are sure to captivate both children and those who love to read to children. Wonderfully uplifting and imaginative, it spans an entire range of emotions and colours and makes one's heart sing,\" said the jury, Adwoa Badoe, Renata Liwska and Hugh MacDonald, in a press release.\nTranslated literature: Descent into Night, translated by Phyllis Aronoff & Howard Scott from the original French by Edem Awumey\nDescent into Night was translated by Phyllis Aronoff and Howard Scott. (Talonbooks/Mawenzi)\nDescent into Night follows a playwright named Ito Baraka who, in his final days, furiously documents the hardships that have shaped him. In his native land, an unnamed West African country, Baraka was imprisoned in a camp and tortured for distributing leaflets with Samuel Beckett quotes. He owes his life to his cellmate, an old wise teacher named Koli Lem, with whom he shared a love for literature. The original French edition by Edem Awumey, Explication de la nuit, received rave reviews from literary critics.\n\"Descent into Night, translated by Phyllis Aronoff and Howard Scott, is a beautifully assured rendering of a text offering many translation challenges. The translators agilely follow the text as it shifts between an ailing Quebec writer's regrets about his life, and his long-ago involvement in a failed West African revolution, which haunts him into the present. This translation skillfully captures the lyricism of the French text,\" said the jury, Dawn M. Cornelio, Peter Feldstein and Kathryn Gabinet-Kroo, in a press release.\nBotticelli in the Fire & Sunday in Sodom is a collection of two plays written by playwright, author and theatre director Jordan Tannahill. (Alejandro Santiago/Playwrights Canada Press)\nPlaywright Jordan Tannahill revisits and reframes the historic and the mythic with Botticelli in the Fire & Sunday in Sodom. The work visits famed artist Sandro Botticelli as he paints the masterpiece that is The Birth of Venus to examine the sexual and political politics that were at play. In Sunday in Sodom, Tannahill places the Biblical destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in the present day, looking at Lot's wife and what transpired during that fateful event. Tannahill previously won the Governor General's Literary Award in 2014 for Age of Minority: Three Solo Plays.\n\"Jordan Tannahill's two-play volume explores the fragility of social consensus in a world made uneasy by the forces of social division. Both plays are poetic, irreverent and funny, offering the pleasure of entertainment while displaying masterful literary ability. Tannahill possesses a powerful artistic voice that reflects where we come from, who we are and who we may become,\" said jurors, Rosa Laborde, Ian Ross and Kent Stetson, in a press release."

            "Proposition 8 is a contradiction: Its promise to improve patient care at dialysis facilities and contain costs will not be realized \u2014 instead, the measure will negatively impact public health in California. The proposal to redirect health care resources is misguided and will lead to higher health care costs and barriers to care.\nHere\u2019s how:\nSome 83 percent of California dialysis clinics will operate at a loss if Prop. 8 is implemented, according to the forecast of the independent Berkeley Research Group. Fewer dialysis clinics in operation will lead to patient crowding in the remaining clinics and limit dialysis appointments.\nProp. 8 will limit access to care for all dialysis patients because it specifically limits reimbursement from private insurance. The higher reimbursement rates from private insurance are what currently offsets the lower reimbursements to the clinics for Medi-Cal and Medicare. Thus, financial risk is distributed among high-earning and low-earning clinics \u2014 some of which are not profitable \u2014 and between urban and rural clinics. DaVita and Fresenius, the two major dialysis corporations, provide the majority of dialysis services in California and have a broad geographic presence.\nProp. 8 will drive up administrative costs. To regulate revenues, dialysis clinics will be required to develop additional accounting practices to track charges to insurance companies. The California Department of Public Health will be required to review these filings, at an estimated cost in the millions of dollars. Unfortunately, none of these expenses contributes directly to improving clinical care.\nThe measure\u2019s narrow definition for allowable costs neglects the value of the indirect costs integral to clinic operations. One example, even though physician dialysis medical directors are mandated, their services would not be an allowable cost. Other exclusions include support staff, facility administrators, nurse coordinators and health educators. Each plays an important role and without a complete team, clinic performance will suffer.\nThe implications of cutbacks to health education programs are particularly severe and the costs steep. Dialysis patients benefit from a strong understanding of their disease as a single missed dialysis session results in a 30 percent increased risk of death. Patients who miss sessions will have to rely on urgent dialysis through emergency room visits and hospital admissions that are much more costly \u2014 a bill that will be spread to all Californians.\nThe timing of this measure could not be worse. In 2016, more than 139,000 patients sought care at dialysis centers \u2014 an increase of 46 percent from eight years before. Poorly controlled diabetes and high blood pressure leads to kidney failure, and patients with kidney failure are living longer.\nDr. Paul Cheung is a resident in internal medicine in San Francisco."

Two others appointed by Mayor David Briley won council approval last week.\nThe council's nine selections include four from neighborhoods that are considered economically distressed: Ashlee Davis, a diversity and inclusion strategist at Cargill; Jamel Campbell-Gooch, a Nashville organizer; Andres Martinez, who works at the Latino advocacy group Conexi\u00f3n Am\u00e9ricas; and Brenda Ross, a retired East Nashville activist.\nMeet the members:The diverse 11 who make up Nashville's new police oversight board\nThree were nominated by either a community group or by petition: Former Nashville Police Chief Emmett Turner; Adele Lewis, deputy chief medical examiner for the Tennessee Department of Health; and Danita Marsh, a former Nashville police officer who was critically injured on duty and now works for the Nashville Conflict Resolution Center.\nThe final two were nominated by individual council members: Nashville attorney and former Circuit Court Judge Matthew Sweeney; and Walter Holloway, a third former police officer appointed to the board.\n(Read more about each selection at the bottom of this story.)\nThe voting stretched until nearly midnight. The election process required the choices of all 33 council members present to be read aloud. It involved multiple rounds of voting in each of three categories to fulfill criteria established in a Metro Charter amendment approved by Nashville voters in November by an overwhelming 59 percent to 41 percent.\nThe council unanimously voted last week to sign off on Briley's two nominees, former Tennessee Attorney General Bob Cooper and Phyllis Hildreth, an administrator at American Baptist College.\nMore than half endorsed by Community Oversight Now\nSix of Tuesday's nine selections had been endorsed by the group Community Oversight Now, which led the petition-drive to trigger the referendum, as satisfactory nominees who would \"meet the letter and spirit of Amendment 1.\"\nVice Mayor Jim Shulman, who presided over the vote proceedings, said he's \"never been more proud\" of seeing so many Nashvillians step up to the plate, including many who had never been to the council chambers.\nHe called the vote difficult because there were \"so many good candidates,\" but said he appreciates everyone who stepped forward.\n\"It makes me proud to be a Nashvillian,\" he said as the council applauded the efforts of the nominees.\nThe board, which has the power to compel witnesses in its investigations, is the culmination of a decades-long push from black leaders in Nashville. It can issue reports assessing allegations of misconduct by Metro police and recommend disciplinary action to agencies involved in public safety.\nSupport our work: Subscribe to The Tennessean\nAmendment 1:How the campaign for Nashville's oversight board trounced the well-financed opposition\nWaffle House shooting hero, former public defender's bids fall short\nMore than 180 Nashvillians received initial nominations to serve on the panel.A council committee spent three days last week interviewing all 155 nominees who filled out questionnaires.\nThe Nashville Fraternal Order of Police, which unsuccessfully fought the referendum at the polls and so far in court, in a statement expressed concerns about the short timeline to interview nominees.\nBut the FOP offered support for the new board, saying it \"welcomes the diversity of background and experience that each of the appointed members bring to the board\" and looks forward to working with the members as the FOP \"continues its community outreach efforts.\"\nThe full list of nominees covered an even broader cross section of Nashville and included some prominent city leaders.\nNotable nominees who fell short included Antioch Waffle House shooting hero James Shaw Jr., who didn't receive a single vote, former Davidson County Public Defender Dawn Deaner, multiple former council members, and Sheila Clemmons-Lee, the mother of the late Jocques Clemmons, an African-American man who was fatally shot by a Nashville officer in 2017.\nLegal fight:Community oversight board belonged on the Nashville ballot, appeals court says; vote stands\nWhat's next for the oversight board?\nThe oversight board \u2014 inspired in part by recent shootings of two black men, including Clemmons, by white police officers in Nashville \u2014 must be in operation by March 29 in accordance with the charter amendment.\nBriley is expected to direct the board's next moves before the panel begins its work.\n\"Last night, the Metro Council selected a diverse group of highly qualified individuals for Nashville's Community Oversight Board,\" Briley said in a statement. \"I'm grateful to the council for the hard work of narrowing such an outstanding slate of nominees, and to the nominees for their willingness to serve.\"\nPrior to the November vote, Briley expressed reservations about the proposal.\nAmong his objections were \"politicizing\" the board by having the council in charge of approving nominations. He also cautioned that \"budgeting by charter amendment\" would set a bad precedent. The referendum proposal came with a $1.5 million annual price tag.\nNonetheless, Briley has said he supports the concept of community oversight and will do his part to implement the new board.\nThe state of Tennessee might have the final say over the oversight board, however.\nFollowing November's vote, the board caught the eye of the Republican-dominated state legislature, raising the possibility of intervention on the issue during the current General Assembly session. House Speaker Glen Casada, R-Franklin, has said he plans to explore whether to pursue state action that could preempt the new oversight board. He's raised legal concerns about the panel and said he and other Republicans are concerned Nashville \"wrote it poorly.\"\nWho they are: Nashville's 11 community oversight board members\nAshlee Davis specializes in inclusion and diversity at Cargill and previously worked in President Barack Obama's administration.

The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, a friend of Gold told the Times. He was 57.\nBorn in 1960, Gold grew up in L.A. and briefly played in a new-wave band called Overman. In 1982, he received a degree in music history and, later that decade, became music editor at LA Weekly. He went on to contribute to Spin, Rolling Stone, Details, and other music publications throughout the \u201990s, writing popular pieces on gangsta rap, Chris Cornell, and more.\nThe following decades saw him cement his reputation as a celebrated food critic around L.A. He picked up the Pulitzer Prize for criticism in 2007, during his second tenure at LA Weekly. In 2016, Ecco Press bought his proposal for a memoir that was to be titled \u201cBreakfast on Pico.\u201d\nCORRECTION: Gold was at LA Weekly when he won the Pulitzer, not, as previously stated, the Los Angeles Times."

Gahler said a total of seven people were shot in the attack, with the three others expected to survive.\nIt appears only one weapon was used - a 9 mm Glock handgun that was registered in Moseley's name - and no shots were fired by responding law enforcement officers, he added.\nThe female shooter listed 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth' as her favourite quote / Facebook\n\"She had reported for her workday as usual, and around 9 a.m. the shooting began, striking victims both outside the business and inside the facility,\" Mr Gahler said.\nThe shooter killed three people before turning the gun on herself / EPA\nHe called it a \"senseless crime,\" adding investigators didn't have any motive immediately after the shooting.

        "articles": [
            "SPOILER ALERT: This review contains details of the movie version of The Dirt\nHaving taken decades to make it to the screen, you kind of knew any adaptation of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce\u2019s 2001 memoir The Dirt was going to be problematic, to put it politely.\nInfamy has a tiring tendency to downgrade over time to just being lame, which truly is the greatest praise one can heap on this Jeff Tremaine directed pic that debuted today on Netflix. Perhaps due from the limited requirements of his past gigs helming the often hilarious but plotless Jackass movies, Tremaine delivers set-ups in The Dirt, but no actual story besides an elongated Behind The Music.\nThe fact is Nikki Sixx, Tommy Lee, ankylosing spondylitis suffering Mick Mars and Vince Neil deserved better. On board as producers, the battle-scarred bass player, drummer, guitarist and singer have earned a movie that confessionally puts it all out there, like their book.\nObviously, they didn\u2019t get it here.\nMaybe it\u2019s because versions of the best-selling oral history from the often tragically imbibing or imploding Sunset Strip band and Neil Strauss having passed through many hands and rights holders over the years. A process that seems to, like the drugs sold outside at Cr\u00fce shows back in the 80s, inevitably have stomped the kick out of the whole thing.\nThe slouching result of this Machine Gun Kelly, Daniel Webber, Douglas Booth and Game of Thrones alum Iwan Rheon starrer is more 2001\u2019s sad Rockstar featuring Marky Mark Wahlberg. That\u2019s a long-lost way in the tall grass from the arrogant abandon of Michael Winterbottom\u2019s 24 Hour Party People from 2002 \u2013 a more obvious blueprint, if you know what I mean?\nWith the exception of a mainly POV montage detailing a day on tour for Roadies vet Kelly portrayed Lee, which starts off with the drummer handcuffed to the bed, most of The Dirt is bleached pretty clean from its feral and self-admitted sordid source material. Yes, there is Vince Neil\u2019s drunken 1984 car crash that killed Hanoi Rocks drummer Razzle and the deeply moving death of the singer\u2019s young daughter from cancer.\nThose are, however, rare exceptions in this straight to MOR movie that has a limited emotional range outside of party time.\nEither in the interest of brevity, legal deniability in the #metoo era or being designated as violent pornography, the Tom Kapinos and Amanda Adelson penned script tosses out the truly terrible things and the interesting things that M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce did all those decades ago. The corporate climate seems to be having settled on reducing the tale of The Dirt to mainly a mere collection of drunken shenanigans and an overdose or three.\nAs well, entertaining intersections in the book with big names and other bands, that don\u2019t involve licking up urine with Ozzy Osbourne, are absent from the flick. So is at least one manager, Mel Gibson, and several wives, including Pamela Anderson.\nAlong with carving off all the messy or convoluted bits as authorized band biographies like Bohemian Rhapsody and Straight Outta Compton have done in recent years too, The Dirt is also oddly overly lite and visually flat. A truly bizarre prospect when you consider that darkly and deeply talented Get Out cinematographer Toby Oliver was behind the lens here \u2013 and how great that Jordon Peele directed Oscar winner looked.\nHaving seen the band at its peak on the Dr. Feelgood tour and a few more times since, it was always clear the Cr\u00fce was never a great band despite having some great tunes. However, what they were extremely entertaining at, even from the cheap seats. was being bad \u2013 which, sadly, is what The Dirt the movie is in all the wrong ways."

            "But on a picturesque summer day, the ocean off Longnook Beach proved too enticing, as dozens of people ventured into the water Thursday, despite numerous new shark sightings near the scene of the attack. Even those safe on shore said the attack \u2014 the first on a person in Massachusetts waters in six years \u2014 wouldn\u2019t keep them from the ocean long.\nTRURO \u2014 One day after a shark seriously injured a New York man in the waters off a remote Cape Cod beach here \u2014 a feeding ground for seals and the site of frequent shark activity \u2014 the ocean was supposed to be off limits and signs warned visitors to \u201cswim at your own risk.\u201d\nGreat white sharks were seen Thursday near Longnook Beach in Truro, where a man was bitten the day before.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the alternative is,\u201d said Peter Sistrom, who visited the ocean-side beach Thursday. \u201cYou just never go in the water again?\u201d\nThe victim, identified Thursday as William Lytton, 61, of Scarsdale, N.Y., remained in serious condition Thursday at Tufts Medical Center in Boston after sustaining puncture wounds to his hip area. Lytton was standing about 30 yards offshore when he was bitten, but was able to make it to shore.\nGet Metro Headlines The 10 top local news stories from metro Boston and around New England delivered daily. Enter Email Sign Up\nWitnesses said beachgoers ran to Lytton\u2019s aid, bundling him in a towel and carrying him up the sand dunes to emergency responders. Lytton\u2019s gash was deep, almost to the bone, one witness said.\nLytton is a professor of physiology and pharmacology at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn. He graduated from Harvard University in 1978.\n\u201cOur thoughts and well wishes are with him and his family as he recuperates,\u201d said Dawn Walker, a spokeswoman for SUNY Downstate Medical Center. Lytton\u2019s family requested privacy.\nOn Thursday, beachgoers recounted the horrifying incident. Marc Charbonneau, 56, of Montreal said he had seen Lytton swimming by himself at high tide, in water that was \u201cway over his head.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nLytton was swimming near seals, said Charbonneau and a friend, Kevin Cox, 69, of North Carolina. Lytton was beyond the seals when he swam past the two men, parallel to the shore, Cox said.\nSeals off the shore near Longnook Beach in Truro. (David L Ryan/Globe Staff\nAnother witness, who declined to give his name, said he and his family had just pulled into the parking lot when a woman ran up a steep bluff and yelled, \u201cDoes anybody have a cellphone? There\u2019s been a shark attack.\u201d\nSoon after, the man saw about 10 people carrying Lytton from the water. Lytton was wrapped in a towel, and when it slipped off the man saw \u201ca pattern of red marks\u201d on Lytton\u2019s leg, he said.\nJoanne Fredericks, Charbonneau\u2019s wife, said she tried to comfort a distraught woman after the attack.\n\u201cShe came up crying,\u201d Fredericks said. \u201cShe thought maybe he lost a limb or something.\u201d\nBrian Carlstrom, superintendent of the Cape Cod National Seashore, said officials were working with the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy to determine what kind of shark bit Lytton.\nKenneth Dutra was on duty at Longnook Beach. Warnings are posted about sharks and the possible danger of swimming. David L. Ryan/Globe Staff\nGreg Skomal, a senior biologist with the state Division of Marine Fisheries, said it was a \u201cvery good probability\u201d that the bite came from a great white shark, citing the species\u2019 strong presence off the Massachusetts coast this time of year.\nYet Skomal said he couldn\u2019t make a definitive determination without examining Lytton\u2019s wound and learning more about the encounter.\nJames Sulikowski, a shark researcher at the University of New England, said the bite may have come from a sandbar shark, a species that also lives off the Massachusetts coast and is much smaller. Sandbar sharks are about 4 to 5 feet long, while great whites measure about 8 feet.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cPuncture wounds are typical of a shark that size,\u201d he said.\nSulikowski said shark bites are extremely rare, even as the great white population appears to be increasing. Describing the incident as an \u201cattack\u201d was not accurate, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like the shark was waiting to come out of the darkness and bite this person,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a mistaken-identity interaction, more than anything else. It\u2019s nothing to get alarmed about.\u201d\nThe International Shark Attack File, a database of known attacks, cites only 26 fatal shark attacks off US waters in the last 50 years. The last fatal attack in Massachusetts is thought to have occurred in 1936, when a 16-year-old was seized by a 6-foot shark in Mattapoisett and later died from his wounds.\nThe Atlantic White Shark Conservancy tagged a shark. David L Ryan/Globe Staff\nBut encounters are happening more as shark populations grow, said Gavin Naylor, an evolutionary biologist who directs the Florida Program for Shark Research.\nThe increase is driven by two factors \u2014 conservation policies that protect great white sharks and seals, a favorite source of food that has become far more abundant, he said.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is this ecosystem come back to what it used to be maybe 50 years ago,\u201d Naylor said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the reinstatement of a natural balance.\u201d\nThat increase is a positive for the environment, but creates a natural tension \u201cbetween people wanting to be in the water and these predators,\u201d Naylor said.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cPeople need to be acutely aware that they share the water with these creatures,\u201d he said.\nDespite the attack, Steve Roderick, the president of the Truro Chamber of Commerce, said he doesn\u2019t anticipate a drop in visitors. When a man was bitten by a shark in Truro in 2012, the town saw no drop in tourism, he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of beaches in Truro. We have a lot of waterfront; there\u2019s a lot of places that you can go,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it would hopefully be a little ripple but not a long-term effect.\u201d\nThe Cape Cod National Seashore promotes shark safety tips, which include never swimming alone or close to seals, Carlstrom said.\nOn Thursday, there were seven shark sightings from Truro to the tip of the Cape, according to the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy.\nIn Truro, Laurie DeCiantis, 47, said she and her family have visited the beach every summer for the past 20 years. DeCiantis knew something was wrong when she saw at least five helicopters buzzing overhead on Wednesday afternoon.\nThere have been far more shark sightings in recent years, she said. But it wasn\u2019t until she talked to an official at the beach parking lot that she learned about the severity of the incident.\n\u201cOver the years we\u2019ve seen activity. We\u2019ve seen fins,\u201d she said. \u201cBut over the last few summers it\u2019s gotten much more prevalent.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nA beachgoer stood on his head at Longnook Beach in Truro.

Each year there is a theme, with a strong focus on remembrance and learning from the past. The Holocaust Memorial Day also pays tribute to those who died in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur.\nHow to mark Holocaust Memorial Day Each year thousands of activities take place for HMD, bringing people from all backgrounds together to learn lessons from the past. Activities are organised from schools to libraries, workplaces and local authorities. Since 2005, HMD has been supported by the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust (HMDT) - a government funded charity.\nHolocaust Memorial Day 2019: The remembrance day takes place on January 27\nIf you\u2019re not sure how you want to mark the day, the HMDT has provided a search engine where you can find activities near you. You can access the page HERE. HMD activities offer a real opportunity to honour the experiences of people affected by the Holocaust and genocide, and challenge ourselves to work for a safer, better future, the HMD Trust said. In 2016, nearly 6,000 HMD activities took place across the UK.\nHolocaust Memorial Day 2019: The remembrance has existed since 2001\nWhat is this year\u2019s theme? \"Torn from home\" is the theme for Holocaust Memorial Day 2019. The campaign encourages people to reflect on how the enforced loss of a safe place to call \u201chome\u201d is part of the trauma faced by anyone experiencing persecution and genocide, according to the HMD Trust. The trust writes: \u201cOn HMD 2019 we will reflect on what happens when individuals, families and communities are driven out of, or wrenched from their homes, because of persecution or the threat of genocide, alongside the continuing difficulties survivors face as they try to find and build new homes when the genocide is over.\nHolocaust Memorial Day 2019: A service is held at York Minster"

            "Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein assured Jordan that the FBI was doing everything in its power to respond to the House of Representatives' requests. (Video: Reuters)\nGift Article Share\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) is the Republicans' designated attack dog on the House Judiciary Committee. He's the guy pushing conspiracy theories about the FBI and President Trump. And he's the guy whose push for a second special counsel based on these theories earned a sharp rebuke from Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\nOn Thursday, Jordan again found himself getting shut down by one of the embattled leaders of the Justice Department \u2014 this time in somewhat embarrassing fashion.\nIn a tense exchange, Jordan suggested that Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who oversees special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's Russia investigation and has earned Trump's ire, was withholding key information from Congress about the probe. Jordan badgered Rosenstein for several minutes, clearly trying to get under his skin. And it worked, to some degree, with Rosenstein at one point saying, \u201cYour use of this to attack me personally is deeply wrong.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nBut then things fell apart for Jordan, and he undermined his own case. He turned to media reports about an alleged threat by Rosenstein to members of Congress. Fox News's Catherine Herridge reported June 12 that Rosenstein had threatened to \u201c 'subpoena' emails, phone records and other documents from lawmakers and staff on\u201d the GOP-controlled House Intelligence Committee. That's the committee led by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) that has been doing Trump's bidding in a way that its Senate counterpart simply hasn't, including releasing the \u201cNunes memo.\u201d Other conservative outlets have run with the claim, but outlets such as CNN and even Sessions have said it didn't happen.\nAfter Rosenstein rebuked Jordan's use of anonymous media reports, Jordan read from a quote that one anonymous House committee staffer gave to Fox.\n\u201cThis is what they said: 'Having the nation's number one law enforcement officer threaten to subpoena your calls and emails is downright chilling,' \u201d Jordan said. \u201cDid you threaten to subpoena their calls and emails?\u201d\nAdvertisement\n\u201cNo, sir, and there's no way to subpoena phone calls,\u201d Rosenstein said, clearly pleased with himself.\nThere were audible laughs in the room.\nJordan stumbled for what to say next \u2014 \u201cWell, I mean, I'm reading what the press said\u201d \u2014 before pressing Rosenstein on what he said. Rosenstein flatly denied that he had ever said it and noted that he was under oath. He challenged the sources who claim he threatened people to also say so under oath.\nThe subpoena distinction is a technical one, to be sure; while you can subpoena phone records, you can't subpoena phone calls. But Jordan was clearly knocked off his game and for some reason didn't even try to make that distinction. It's also a quote that suggests the staffer didn't exactly know what they were talking about.\nAnd the attempted undermining of the Russia investigation suffered another setback.\nGiftOutline Gift Article"

            "Whole Foods Salads Recalled For Salmonella And Listeria Concerns\nLeafy greens are yet again the topic of a food poisoning scare. Approximately 940 pounds of ready-to-eat salads with chicken sold at Whole Foods are being recalled due to possible salmonella and listeria contamination. According to the United States Department of Agriculture's Food and Safety Inspection Service, the prepackaged meals were made by Sacramento, California-based GH Foods and could contain a tainted corn ingredient.\nThe World's Biggest Food Poisoning Scares\nThe following products are affected by this recall:\n9.75-ounce clear plastic clamshell packages containing \"Santa Fe Style Salad With Chicken\" and \"best if sold by\" dates from October 17, 2018, to October 18, 2018\n10-ounce clear plastic clamshell packages containing \"365 by Whole Foods Market BBQ Style Chopped Salad With Chicken\" and \"best if sold by\" dates from October 17, 2018, to October 20, 2018\nSix-pound bagged kits containing \"BBQ Style Salad With White Chicken\" and \"use by\" dates from October 17, 2018, to October 22, 2018\nEight-ounce clear plastic clamshell packages containing \"365 by Whole Foods Market Chicken Fajita Salad\" and \"best if sold by\" dates from October 17, 2018, to October 20, 2018.\nThese items were produced on various dates from October 9, 2018, through October 13, 2018. All were shipped to retailers in California and bear the establishment number \"EST. P-39994\" inside the USDA mark of inspection. According to the USDA, there have been no confirmed illnesses in connection to this recall. Consumers worried about health issues should contact a medical provider at once. The Daily Meal has reached out to GH Foods and Whole Foods for comment.\nThe consumption of food contaminated with salmonella could result in salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever that show 12 to 72 hours after eating poisoned food. This normally goes away after four to seven days, and most people recover without treatment.\nSimilarly, food contaminated with listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis \u2014 a serious infection that primarily affects the elderly, those with weakened immune systems, pregnant women, and babies. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, headaches, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions \"sometimes preceded by diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms,\" according to the USDA. This illness requires medical attention and can be treated with antibiotics. Here's hoping you're ahead of the game with news of this product recall and are able to avoid food poisoning in the first place."

            "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\nIt was November 2003. Mark Geragos was earning a worldwide rep for defending the most reviled man in America inside a courtroom in Modesto, Calif., when his beeper started screaming. The business at hand was serious enough without digital distractions. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight That April, the murdered remains of a missing 27-year-old pregnant woman named Laci Peterson splashed ashore on San Francisco Bay. Police charged the victim\u2019s husband, Scott Peterson, a philandering fertilizer salesman who authorities said killed his wife and unborn son. Most legal experts and TV pundits said the evidence stacked against Peterson made an acquittal a long shot \u2014 an opinion echoed by Geragos on cable TV, until the mustachioed and media-savvy Los Angeles attorney decided to represent him.\nBut as he was in court with Peterson, his pager kept going off. The calls were to alert the attorney that another client, pop star Michael Jackson, had just been served search warrants at his Neverland Ranch. Two days later, Geragos walked Jackson into a police station in Santa Barbara, Calif., where he was charged with child molestation.\nAdvertisement\nGeragos was suddenly thrust front and center in the country\u2019s two most high-profile criminal cases. And his beeper did not shut up. Over a 24-hour period that week, his pager buzzed 700 times, Geragos told the New York Times.\n\u201cAt one point, I thought of throwing it in the ocean,\u201d the attorney explained to the Times. \u201cTo some degree it is embarrassing. I suppose because I don\u2019t think any of this is about me. It is about the client. Hopefully it passes and passes quickly.\u201d\nGeragos, however, never slipped back below the radar.\nOver the past two decades, he\u2019s become the go-to attorney for the rich and famous. His client list evokes a tabloid rundown of celebrity mug shots: actor Robert Downey Jr.; actress Winona Ryder; rapper Nate Dogg; presidential sibling Roger Clinton; pop star Chris Brown. Just in the last year, Geragos secured a settlement for Colin Kaepernick in his lawsuit against the NFL and also stepped in to defend \u201cEmpire\u201d actor Jussie Smollett against charges he faked a hate crime. The Rolodex of big-name clients, combined with regular cable news appearances, have made Geragos one of the most recognized figures in American law.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to represent somebody, I think at the very least they deserve someone who can find the good in them,\u201d Geragos told the Los Angeles Times in 2003. \u201cI don\u2019t think most people are evil. I think sometimes people are demonized unfairly.\u201d\nBut Geragos is now in his own surprising legal jam.\nOn Monday, federal authorities arrested attorney Michael Avenatti, the former lawyer for adult-film actress Stormy Daniels. As The Washington Post reported, one indictment against the attorney accuses Avenatti of trying to extort millions of dollars from Nike. Citing sources close to the investigation, The Post reported Geragos is the unnamed \u201cco-conspirator\u201d alleged to have worked the scheme with Avenatti. Following the news, CNN announced it was dropping Geragos as an on-air contributor.\nAvenatti has denied the charges. Geragos, who has not been charged, did not respond to an email for comment.\nAdvertisement\nBut the link between Avenatti and Geragos goes beyond Monday\u2019s allegations. Both are on-camera naturals fueled by an underdog ethos. And Geragos first landed in the national spotlight in the 1990s by walking into a political firestorm that led right to the White House \u2014 circumstances not unlike those that catapulted Avenatti into national recognition over the last year.\nLaw was in Geragos\u2019s blood. His family were members of Los Angeles\u2019s close Armenian American community. His father worked as a district attorney before entering private practice.\n\u201cMy father was sworn in as a D.A. in January 1957, the same month I was conceived,\u201d Geragos told Super Lawyers in 2009. As a kid, Geragos would sit in courtrooms and watch as his father\u2019s cases unfold, an experience that fixed his own trajectory toward the courthouse.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cYou could get paid for shooting your mouth off and not much else,\u201d he told Super Lawyers.\nGeragos studied anthropology and sociology at Haverford College, then after graduation entered Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. While studying law, he worked up a side business as a rock concert promoter in Pasadena, booking shows for acts such as the Ramones, the Pretenders, and the Go-Go\u2019s, according to Super Lawyers. In 1983, he began working at his father\u2019s firm.\n\u201cHe was always a very public kind of person,\u201d Stanley A. Goldman, a friend and former law professor, told the New York Times in 2003. \u201c[H]e claims he rarely showed up for class because he was organizing rock concerts. I like Mark Geragos. A lot of people don\u2019t. He can be extremely pushy.\u201d\nGeragos\u2019s first splash into mainstream news came more than a decade later, when he began representing a woman at the center of a presidential scandal then dominating national headlines.\nAdvertisement\nSusan McDougal was a former business partner of President Bill Clinton on the failed Whitewater real estate deal. When McDougal refused to testify before a grand jury called by independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, she was sentenced to 18 months in prison for civil contempt beginning in 1996.\nUpon release, McDougal was charged again for criminal contempt and obstruction of justice. At the suggestion of his father, Geragos stepped in to her defense. As he explained to the New York Times, Geragos took the case pro bono, explaining to McDougal that because of his Armenian background, he \u201chad a special appreciation for victims of government oppression.\u201d\nWhen McDougal went to trial in Little Rock in 1999, the cornerstone of Geragos\u2019s case was that his client had been railroaded in retaliation for not cooperating in Starr\u2019s \u201cvendetta\u201d against the Clintons. The proceedings started less than a month after Clinton was acquitted at his impeachment trial in the Senate.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI fully intend to put Kenneth W. Starr on trial,\u201d Geragos told reporters at the start of the case, The Post reported at the time.\nThe attorney made more headlines by grilling Starr deputy W. Hickman Ewing Jr. on the witness stand. Under Geragos\u2019s questioning, Ewing admitted he had drafted an indictment against Hillary Clinton during the Starr investigation.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like that she was evasive,\u201d Ewing testified, according to Super Lawyers.\n\u201cSort of like you right now?,\u201d Geragos snapped back.\nThe jury acquitted McDougal on the obstruction of justice charge and deadlocked on the criminal contempt charge. Geragos was defiant on the steps of the courthouse. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the guts to retry it,\u201d he said, the Los Angeles Times reported in 2003. He eventually worked to get McDougal a full pardon in the last hours of Clinton\u2019s presidency.\nAdvertisement\nAs Avenatti\u2019s representation of Daniels in her lawsuit against President Trump over an alleged affair punched the attorney\u2019s ticket into cable news green rooms, Geragos\u2019s work for McDougal elevated his career to a new level.\n\u201cI always tease him about my case launching him into the limelight,\u201d McDougal told the New York Times in 2003. \u201cHe was just absolutely perfect.\u201d\nUnlike Avenatti, Geragos spun the attention into a busy practice \u2014 too busy, some critics said. In 2003, when he was shuttling up and down California defending both Jackson and Peterson, the pop star eventually replaced him. He continued leading Peterson\u2019s defense, but lost the case; the husband was sentenced to death row.\nBut those setbacks have not kept his phone from buzzing whenever a high-profile personality is in trouble \u2014 including Avenatti. According to the Hollywood Reporter, when Avenatti was arrested over an alleged domestic violence situation last November, he consulted with Geragos about the charges. (Prosecutors declined to file any charges related to the incident.)\nAdvertisement\nBut if the recent indictment is correct, the two attorneys\u2019 relationship continued last week, when Avenatti and Geragos allegedly approached Nike, threatening to expose employees for funneling payments to top high school basketball players and their families.\nThe indictment alleges the attorneys demanded the company to hire them both to conduct an internal investigation into the issue for $15 million to $25 million. Should the case move forward, both attorneys will likely seek representation cut from the same mold \u2014 a vociferous, TV-ready advocate.\n\u201cI do take seriously the idea that you\u2019re not supposed to turn down a case just because of its notoriety,\u201dGeragos once told the Los Angeles Times.\nMore from Morning Mix:\nGiftOutline Gift Article"

            "Here are a few takeaways from the interview, including Garoppolo\u2019s unorthodox introduction to playing quarterback.\nThe surprising 2014 draft, studying and competing with an NFL legend, and the eventual trade to San Francisco were all heavily covered in a recent profile written by Bleacher Report\u2019s Joon Lee .\nHeading into his first full season as the starting quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, Jimmy Garoppolo still has a lot of thoughts on his time with the Patriots.\nGaroppolo was almost in a car crash heading to the airport after the 49ers trade.\nAs Lee describes it, Garoppolo was in the back of a limo taking him to the airport after the Patriots traded him to the 49ers when he was nearly in a car crash on I-95 in Massachusetts:\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThat\u2019s when the unexpected nightmare began. Another car exited the highway, skidded off the side of the ramp, turned straight toward Jimmy\u2019s door\u2014straight toward the man who is now the third-highest-paid player in the National Football League.\u201d\nGet Point After Delivering exclusive analysis and commentary on the Patriots and the NFL right to your inbox, on weekdays during the season. Enter Email Sign Up\nLuckily, Garoppolo\u2019s driver veered off the road, avoiding a collision.\nWhat was Garoppolo doing during his car ride? According to Lee, he was studying the new playbook he had to learn.\nRelated: Why are the Patriots suddenly not everyone\u2019s darlings of the NFL?\nHis response to the Brady-Belichick rumors almost pose more questions than they answer.\nWhen asked about the rumored drama between Bill Belichick and Tom Brady, and how it might have led to the 49ers trade, Garoppolo offered an ambiguous quote.\n\u201cParts of it were true, parts of it I knew weren\u2019t true, parts I didn\u2019t know if they were true or not,\u201d Garoppolo said. \u201cI appreciated that Coach Belichick put me in the best situation\u2014you hear those horror stories about guys finding out from \u2026 Twitter.\u201d\nHe was 6\u20192\u2033 in the sixth grade, but didn\u2019t play quarterback until high school.\nAdvertisement\nGaroppolo\u2019s background in football was explained to a new level, including that he didn\u2019t start playing the sport until sixth grade. Even then, he began as a tight end and linebacker.\nRemarkably, he was 6\u20192\u2033 in elementary school, and he became a running back. His coach would often call a halfback passing play, which was \u201calways\u201d a touchdown. Yet according to the story, Garoppolo turned down offers to switch positions to become a quarterback out of respect for his friend who lived down the street (and was the current starter).\nFinally, in 2008 as a junior in high school, Garoppolo transitioned to quarterback. Who did he model his game after? Tom Brady.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even like I was a Patriots fan,\u201d Garoppolo said, \u201cbut seeing him do that, it was flawless. I was like, \u2018OK, that\u2019s how I should throw.\u2019\u201d\nRelated: Bill Belichick texted Jimmy Garoppolo after each of his starts with the 49ers\nHis college coach was stunned he was at Eastern Illinois.\nAfter being recruited and put on scholarship almost blind by Eastern Illinois (\u201cthere was barely enough data or game tape to put together a firm scouting report\u201d), Garoppolo wowed his new coach, Dino Babers.\n\u201cThis guy shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Babers reportedly told a staffer. And after the staffer confused his meaning, Babers clarified.\n\u201cNo, he shouldn\u2019t be here, as in, he shouldn\u2019t be at I-AA,\u201d Babers explained. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole bunch of coaches who should be fired for missing this guy. He\u2019s really, really good.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWillie McGinest gave him a draft day jolt.\nGaroppolo registered his college roommates as his brothers in order to get them into the NFL draft in 2014. They all shared the same hotel room, with Garoppolo giving his bed to friends, instead sleeping on the couch.\nAnd, according to the profile, it led to a moment with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell:\n\u201cOn Day 1 of the draft, Roger Goodell approached the Garoppolo table in the green room. Juice Williams, who is 6\u20197\u201d, black and clearly not Italian, looked up at the commissioner. \u201cEight brothers, huh?\u201d Goodell said with a laugh. (The NFL disputes this.)\u201d\nOn the second day of the draft, Garoppolo had an impromptu run-in with former Patriot Willie McGinest. McGinest told him, \u201cI\u2019ve got a feeling I\u2019m about to call your name here in a bit.\u201d\nGaroppolo thought he was joking, but McGinest proved prophetic 40 minutes later. The first phone call with Belichick went by without incident despite the volume in the room.\n\u201cEveryone was making noises, and I couldn\u2019t hear half the things,\u201d Garoppolo told Lee. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter what was being said. I made sure to say, \u2018Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.\u2019\u201d\nHe shadowed Brady without \u201cruffling feathers.\u201d\nHaving met Brady briefly during a pre-draft visit, Garoppolo came to understood the subtlety of learning from the NFL legend without getting in his way.\n\u201cI was going to watch and literally absorb everything I could from him without being an annoyance,\u201d said Garoppolo. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to ask a ton of questions. I didn\u2019t want to ruffle any feathers. You have to play the politics a little bit.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nRelated: What\u2019s the state of the Patriots offensive line ahead of training camp?\n\u201cWe would push each other and we got two Super Bowls out of it.\u201d\nCompeting day-in and day-out with Brady was perfect for Garoppolo, who explained their post-practice \u201cbucket game\u201d (when quarterbacks try to drop passes into a bucket) was especially intense.\n\u201cThere would be days where one of us would win and you wouldn\u2019t talk to the other for a little while,\u201d Garoppolo noted. \u201cWe\u2019d be fine the next day, but it was one of the best things for me. We would push each other and we got two Super Bowls out of it.\u201d\n\u201cThe competitiveness between the two of us was very similar,\u201d Garoppolo said. \u201cIf I\u2019m playing my best friend in one-on-one basketball, if we are both into it, by the end, we are going to hate each other. That\u2019s how it is. All the good competitors have that. We got along, but there were always times where we wanted to kill each other. It was a healthy, competitive relationship.\u201d\nLove advice from Brady?\nThis was one of the few front on which Garoppolo revealed basically nothing.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that,\u201d he told Lee. \u201cThat\u2019s top-secret stuff.\u201d\nHe\u2019s always had the mindset to believe he could beat anyone, even Brady.\nAdvertisement\nGaroppolo acknowledged that he\u2019s not lacking in confidence, and never has. When he first arrived in New England, he admitted thinking he could win the starting job over Brady, even if that was impossible:\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had that mindset. I knew that [Brady] was better than me in my first day in the NFL. Naturally, you\u2019re the rookie and he\u2019s the veteran, but you have to have that mindset, that you want to be the starter.\n\u201cEven when I was a little kid, my brothers, whenever we would play, I would literally always think I was going to win. I wouldn\u2019t, but I would always think that. It\u2019s like when I go to New England, when I first got there, I thought in my head, \u201cI\u2019m better than this dude.\u201d\nGaroppolo tempered the quote by saying he would \u201cnever speak that\u201d quote aloud. In his own words, it\u2019s about his mindset.\n\u201cI\u2019m not stupid,\u201d Garoppolo said. \u201cYou have to pick your battles, but I had belief in myself that I could do certain things, and it\u2019s always worked out pretty well. It will always be in me, that drive that comes from my dad telling me that someone is always working harder, that I\u2019m always in last place and I need to catch up to someone else.\u201d\nThe 49ers wanted a quarterback who wouldn\u2019t wait for Brady to retire.\nWhile San Francisco\u2019s football hierarchy wanted Garoppolo well before the 2017 NFL trade deadline, they were really sold on him after he forced the Patriots\u2019 hand.\n\u201cI know New England wanted to keep him there and keep him on ice before Tom eventually retired \u2026 but what was exciting for me was that New England knew he wasn\u2019t going to re-sign there,\u201d Shanahan explained to Lee. \u201cHe wanted to start and he wanted to play. He forced their hand. \u2026 It would\u2019ve been cool to play for Belichick and do that stuff and be in that system once Brady retires, but he didn\u2019t want to wait. That\u2019s the guy you want.\u201d"

            "WASHINGTON \u2013 Obamacare is more popular with American voters than the Republican-enacted tax cuts, according to a new Fox News Poll.\nSlightly more than half of voters \u2013 51 percent \u2013 had a favorable opinion of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare.\nIn contrast, only 40 percent of voters had a favorable view of the 2017 tax cuts championed by congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump, according to the Aug. 19-21 poll of more than 1,000 registered voters. The poll has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.\nDemocrats have made health care a big issue in the upcoming congressional midterm elections, charging that Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress have worked to undermine gains made by Obamacare in the affordability and quality of health care coverage.\nRepublicans, meanwhile, are campaigning on their tax cuts, which they say have spurred economic development and created jobs.\nMore:President Donald Trump's answer to Obamacare: Short-term health insurance\nMore:House votes to delay Obamacare insurance tax, loosen health savings accounts restrictions\nVoters expressed a higher opinion of Democrats than Republicans in the poll, with 50 percent saying they have a favorable view of the Democratic Party and 39 percent expressing a favorable view of the Republican Party.\nTrump did slightly better than his party, with 41 percent of voters saying they had a favorable opinion of the GOP president.\nThe economy was the only issue where Trump had a higher percentage of voters approving rather than disapproving of his performance. Poll respondents narrowly approved of Trump's handling of the economy, 49 percent to 44 percent.\nOn Trump's signature issue of border security, 44 percent of voters approved of the president's performance and 51 percent disapproved. On the broader issue of immigration policy, 39 of voters approved of Trump and 57 percent disapproved.\nOn international trade issues, 39 percent approved of Trump's performance and 53 percent disapproved. Trump has drawn bipartisan criticism for imposing tariffs on trading partners, prompting them to raise fees on food and manufactured goods coming into their countries from the U.S.\nOn foreign policy, Trump received an approval rating of 37 percent and a disapproval rating of 55 percent.\nTrump received his lowest approval scores on the issues of health care and race relations.\nThe poll showed that 36 percent of voters approved of the job the president is doing on health care while 55 percent disapproved. Trump and congressional Republicans have tried unsuccessfully to repeal Obamacare but have taken steps to partially dismantle it.\nOn the volatile issue of race relations, only 33 percent of poll respondents approved of Trump's handling of the matter while 58 percent disapproved.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who is retiring after the November elections, remains the most popular congressional leader, although \"popular\" is a relative term.\nRyan had a favorability rate of 31 percent, compared with 29 percent for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., 28 percent for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and 22 percent for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\nRepublican Sen. John McCain, the maverick Arizonan who is being treated for brain cancer, is viewed far more favorably than Trump or any of the congressional leaders. The senator, who has been highly critical of Trump on foreign policy, immigration and a host of other issues, received a favorability rating of 52 percent.\nAmong poll respondents, 49 percent identified themselves as Democrats, 39 percent identified themselves as Republicans, and 12 percent identified themselves as independents or \"other.\""

            "Gift Article Share\nSOCHI, Russia \u2014 What happened Saturday night in the Sochi Olympic stadium defied earthly norms in enough ways that it wound up altering the brain until the scene looked misshapen. So it finally kind of made a demented sense in the 95th minute when the whole thing drifted into psychedelia, as Germany\u2019s relieved players went streaming down the sideline to heave into a festive pile in the stadium corner, having just beheld Toni Kroos\u2019s whiplash winner. They did so as German fans boomed a sound German fans never boom, that unmistakable sound of escape.\nWhat in the World Cup was this 2-1 win by Germany over Sweden?\nIt was a second group game that came off feeling like some gasping semifinal or some death scrap in a prairie. It was an event that gave its 44,287 witnesses an experience nobody ever has, that of seeing Germany \u2014 Germany, that staple of reliability! \u2014 running around all night on a precipice, when the whole idea of Germany is often about the avoidance of precipice. It was a night spent with a defending World Cup champion that hasn\u2019t fallen short of a semifinal this century looking like it might be eliminated after two first-round losses \u2014 as it would have if Sweden\u2019s 1-0 halftime lead had held \u2014 or if it might drift near the early-exit door, as it would have with a draw on Saturday.\nNow Germany has three points in Group F alongside Sweden behind front-running Mexico on six, even as the people who saw it play Sweden will carry home memories soccer fans so seldom have. They saw a German defense \u2014 the German defense, that bulwark of life on Earth! \u2014 look downright harum-scarum against the Swedish counterattack. They saw Germany\u2019s Jerome Boateng look so hopeless that in the 12th minute he had to shove Sweden\u2019s Marcus Berg on a breakaway, and should have gotten carded there with Sweden taking a penalty kick, yet didn\u2019t, yet somehow managed two other cards anyway to depart the premises in the 82nd minute.\nAdvertisement\nThen they saw Germany operate with 10 men from there, yet still hang out around the Swedish goal as if it had 12, so that Germany\u2019s 77-percent possession sometimes felt like 101. A fine mass of passes around the box in the 88th minute established Mario Gomez\u2019s header that goalkeeper Robin Olsen saved, and another threat in the 92nd wound up with Julian Brandt driving from 20 yards and smacking the right post of the goal.\nClearly, the Germans could not finish, and then, at the very last chance, they could.\nWant smart analysis, opinions, viewing guides and more from the World Cup? Sign up for our month-long newsletter. Every match day through the final July 15.\nSomehow in this kooky thing, Sweden\u2019s sub Jimmy Durmaz managed to trip Germany\u2019s Timo Werner left of the box, so that as the curtain fixed to drop on the night, Kroos had a free kick from that spot. He nudged the ball to Marco Reus, who simply stopped it with his foot, teeing up a shot that Kroos sent screaming on a fine curl around the masses and into the upper right side of the net, so that 55-year-old Sweden Manager Janne Andersson called it \u201cprobably the worst end of a game I\u2019ve experienced in my career.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nNobody will forget it, unless Germany just goes blah from here, in which case it will become a dandy little meaningless moment.\nIn fact, the night was so relentless with meaning and surprise that Andersson also expressed anger about the German celebration streaming past the Swedish bench and, he said, \u201crubbing it into our faces.\u201d\nGermany Manager Joachim Loew said, \u201cWe fell into each other\u2019s arms and were so elated.\u201d\nThe Real Madrid employee Kroos said: \u201cHappy, of course. Happy. Was a tough game again today for us. We suffered, but it\u2019s normal if you not score the early goal, and we had the chance, and it\u2019s going to be difficult in the end. It was, but now of course we\u2019re happy.\u201d\nThanks to its loss to Mexico last Sunday and to the Mexicans\u2019 2-1 win over South Korea earlier Saturday, Germany had gone to halftime on the verge of early dismissal, which hadn\u2019t happened to it at this stage since 1938. It had gone to this verge on a sonnet of a goal from Sweden\u2019s Ola Toivonen, who chested Viktor Claesson\u2019s pretty, descending cross in the 32nd minute and plucked the ball over goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. As part of the evening\u2019s gaudy decor, the yellow-clad Swedish quadrant of the stadium bounced like mad.\nAdvertisement\nThen the Germans decided they couldn\u2019t bear to join the roster of defending World Cup champions who fizzle the next time, seemingly exhausted, such as France in 2002 and Italy in 2010 and Spain in 2014. They got Werner\u2019s surge on the left by Gomez\u2019s foot to Reus\u2019s knee and into the left edge of the goal in the 48th.\nThen they spent the rest straining to avoid that draw. They had chances in the 49th minute, the 51st, 56th, 61st, 66th, 72nd, 81st, 88th and 92nd. They had Kroos going just wide, Thomas Mueller heading just wide, Werner flying around on the left, Werner to Jonas Hector, Joshua Kimmich to Werner but then Werner\u2019s shot over the goal, Olsen\u2019s save on Gomez, Brandt\u2019s strike to the post.\nThen, with a 1-1 draw and on one point in the group, with Sweden on four and Mexico on six and those two due to play each other next week, the Germans were done for the night and just about done for good.\nAdvertisement\nThen, they weren\u2019t.\nThey had drifted into such trouble, and clambered out of it so dramatically, that on a night that looked so unfamiliar, it hardly looked like Germany.\n\u2014Chuck Culpepper\n***\nWhat\u2019s next\nGermany: vs. South Korea in Kazan, Wednesday, 10 a.m.\nSweden: vs. Mexico in Ekaterinburg, Wednesday, 10 a.m.\n***\nIn-game updates\nGooooaaaalllll!\nSeconds before full time, Germany\u2019s Toni Kroos scored off a free kick.

What a goal! pic.twitter.com/KA0QkOSWZN \u2014 FOX Sports (@FOXSports) June 23, 2018\nMissed opportunities\nGermany had two chances to take the lead, but failed to do so. In the first, Sweden goalkeeper Robin Olsen made an incredible save, jumping up just in time to tip the ball over the net.\nIn the other, Germany got off a strong strike, but it hit the goal post and was unable to find its way into the net.\nAdvertisement\nBoateng ejected\nAfter Boateng received his second yellow card (in the 81st minute), he was ejected. The yellow card came when Boateng had a collision with Sweden\u2019s Marcus Berg.\nAnother yellow card\nAgainst Germany\u2019s Jerome Boateng in the 70th minute.\nYellow card\nCalled against Sweden\u2019s Albin Edkal in the 51st minute.\nGoal, Germany!\nJust two minutes into the second half, Germany finally got on the board in this World Cup. Marco Reus scored the equalizer in the 48th minute, breathing life into the German side\u2019s hopes of advancing. As long as it can hang on to this tie, Germany will have a shot at reaching the World Cup\u2019s knockout stages.\nMarco Reus gets the equalizer for Germany!\nGame on. pic.twitter.com/ToG82iXd4A \u2014 FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) June 23, 2018\nHalftime update\nIt was a slow first half, but Sweden leads Germany 1-0 heading into the break. The German side has taken more shots and possessed the ball more than the Swedes so far, but it is coming up short where it matters most. A lot is at stake for Germany in the remaining 45 minutes of the match; if they fail to win, they will be eliminated from the tournament.\nGooooaaaalllll!\nSweden draws first blood, scoring in the 31st minute of the game.

The lone goal in that loss came in the 35th minute, when 22-year-old Hirving Lozano picked up Javier Hernandez\u2019s pass inside the penalty area and beat a defender before scoring on Germany\u2019s goalkeeper, Manuel Neuer. The result sent shock waves through Mexico, literally, creating what may have been an artificial man-made earthquake in Mexico, while it left Germany\u2019s future at this World Cup uncertain.\nMexico plays South Korea earlier Saturday; if the favored El Tri earn at least a draw, Germany could be eliminated with a loss against Sweden. No defending champion has failed to make the knockout round since France in 2002.\nAdvertisement\nSweden, meanwhile, got a penalty kick goal from Andreas Granqvist in a 1-0 win over South Korea. It was the first time the Swedes had won their opening World Cup match since 1958, against \u2014 that\u2019s right \u2014 Mexico. Sweden hasn\u2019t beaten Germany in their last 11 meetings, dating to 1978, according to the BBC.\nWhen: Saturday, June 23, 2 p.m. Eastern.\nHow to watch on TV: Fox.\nHow to stream online: Fox Sports and the Fox Soccer Match Pass apps and FoxSportsGo.com.\nHow to watch in Spanish: Telemundo.\nHow to watch in Canada: Bell Media\u2019s TSN and CTV networks, the TSN GO app and TSN.ca/live.\nTeam profiles\nGermany (0-0-1, 0 points)\nLast showing in the World Cup: Champions, 2014.\nBest finish: Champions, 2014, 1990 and 1974.\nNotable: Germany has reached at least the quarterfinals (or finished in the top eight) in 17 of its 18 World Cup appearances. That\u2019s the best rate of any nation.\nFIFA world ranking: 1. ELO world ranking: 3.\nSweden (1-0-0, 3 points)\nLast showing in the World Cup: Round of 16, 2006.\nBest finish: Runner-up, 1958, in a tournament it hosted.\nNotable: Sweden is unbeaten in their last 10 group stage games. Their last group stage loss came in 1990, a 2-1 result against Costa Rica.\nFIFA world ranking: 24. ELO world ranking: 19.\nPlayers to watch\nWinger Emil Forsberg will be key for the Swedes to have a shot against the reigning champions. Forsberg has good speed and a solid repertoire of skills, and is counted on to key Sweden\u2019s attack. Germany\u2019s Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich) is one of the world\u2019s best goalkeepers. He missed most of the Bundesliga season with a foot injury before returning to the national team this month. For the Germans to make the sort of run they\u2019ve come to expect, he will have to be in top form.\nAdvertisement\n\u2014Kendra Andrews\nRead more about the World Cup:\nGiftOutline Gift Article"

            "Something went wrong, please try again later.\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\nWhen the Premier League markets itself as the best in the world, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City and Mauricio Pochettino's are undoubtedly two of the main attractions.\nFeast on the best teams and the best coaches in the world going up against each other in a thrilling league where anyone can beat anyone.\nWhat a farce, then, to butcher one of their biggest selling points by allowing the teams to face one another on a grisly pitch neither calls home watched on by thousands of empty seats. Considerable chunks of the pitch had been churned up by three consecutive NFL games - the most recent just 24 hours before such a showpiece match - and the bits that weren't still clearly boasted the markings of another sport.\nThankfully for those that run the league, City remain worth tuning in for on any occasion.\nDavid and Bernardo Silva give the impression they could pass their way out of a locked room and their exquisite close control has rarely looked better as Guardiola's side moved the ball with a silky smoothness that defied their surroundings.\nEven if the opening goal owed much to Ederson's thumping kick forward, more important was Raheem Sterling's guile to beat England teammate Kieran Trippier before providing the perfect cut-back for Riyad Mahrez - who is increasingly getting into the right moments for his new club.\nTottenham gave City more problems than most teams have this season, repeatedly exploiting space behind Benjamin Mendy on a night that brought the Frenchman's defensive deficiencies to the surface.\nFernandinho and the rest of the defence showed why this team have now gone six league games without conceding though, stretching every bit of strength and skill going to keep the ball away from their net.\nThe second half deteriorated into a game the pitch deserved. There were hoofs, hoiks, and miskicks from two sets of players capable of doing far more, but the rare moments of quality near the goal amid the dross came from the visitors.\nSilva came agonisingly close to finishing off Bernardo's inviting ball into the box and Sergio Aguero forced Hugo Lloris into another excellent save while Erik Lamela blazed over from level with the penalty spot after Pochettino's men had pressed Mahrez into erring.\nSpurs finished the game strongly and contributed to an uncomfortable final 15 minutes for City, Guardiola animated on the touchline as his team struggled to keep the ball and their cool.\nWith Ederson unflappable at the back, though, and Tottenham restricted to just four shots in total and one on target (compared to 13 and 6) it was a deserved win for the champions and one that takes them back to the top of the table after ten games.\nWhile the Premier League would do well to make sure such an evening never happens again, the other 19 teams could do with working out a way to stop this City juggernaut if they are not to see another repeat come the lifting of the title next spring."

            "Tecia Torres and Weili Zhang were on different ends of the mixed martial arts (MMA) spectrum heading into their women\u2019s Strawweight bout tonight (Sat., March 2, 2019) at UFC 235, which took place inside T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. \u201cTiny Tornado\u201d was on a two-fight losing skid, while \u201cMagnum\u201d was on an 18-fight tear dating back to 2014.\nMake that 19 after Zhang was able to dominate Torres en route to a unanimous decision victory after three rounds of action.\nZhang opened up the action with a fancy spinning attack, which she followed up with a high kick, but neither of which were able to get through Torres\u2019 defenses. Zhang landed a nice overhand left, but Torres countered with a right hand of her own. Zhang landed two more spinning back kicks and a nice shot upstairs, triggering a scramble that Torres was able to escape with a quickness. Zhang struggled for a takedown with two minutes remaining in the round, which Torres fought off well, but the Chinese fighter managed to circle behind her and jump on her back. Torres was eventually able to spin her off and clipped her with a nice, hard right hand on the break. Torres scored her own takedown with a few seconds remaining in the round, but Zhang pulled off a nice reversal as the clock expired.\nRound two opened with both ladies bouncing back-and-forth, with Zhang scoring first with a flush spinning backfist. It took about two minutes for things to heat up, with both fighters trading hard shots in the center of the Octagon. Zhang attempted to throw Torres, but she stood her ground and used the fence to remain upright. Zhang eventually got her to the ground and dished out a little ground-and-pound before Torres flipped her over and landed on top in her guard. Torres was unable to do anything with the dominant position, though, with Zhang landing a nice upkick at the buzzer.\nTorres started the third and final frame with a nice front kick to Zhang\u2019s belly, then an effective sidekick that also found its mark. Zhang responded by charging in with a wild combination, but it was Torres who scored with the harder shots as she was trying to retreat. Torres caught a spinning back kick, but then ate an elbow to the face as both her hands were occupied. Zhang scored a big takedown along the cage, but was unable to land anything significant as Torres hid her face in Zhang\u2019s mid-section. Zhang eventually was able to land some hard elbows to Torres\u2019 face \u2014 she was unable to get out from underneath her Chinese opponent.\nAnd that ultimately is what did her in, as Zhang controlled her for the duration of the round. She was also the more dynamic and dominant fighter throughout all three rounds, earning a unanimous decision nod from all three judges who were sitting ringside.\nZhang is on her way up, while Torres is on her way down. Indeed, a 19-fight win streak in MMA is impressive. And she was able to accomplish it at the expense of the No. 7-ranked female in the division.\nFor complete UFC 235: \u201cJones vs. Smith\u201d results, including play-by-play updates, click here."

The schools will exchange $300,000 for the first two games, and Boise State will be paid $800,000 for the game in 2026.\nWhich is fantastic news for Boise State fans and college football fans in general.\nThough we have to wait a good six years for the series to get going again (barring any bowl match ups), any time these two teams meet is going to be a good time.\nBoise State will be making two trips to Eugene, where the legend of The Chosen One began and lead to one of the coolest Blog Bets ever produced.\nAnd a return to Boise where the last time these two played the ending was... less than pleasant.\nBut no matter.\nThe fact that Boise State is a cool 3-0 versus the Ducks has to rub their fans the wrong way. And bragging rights go a long way in football.\nSix years is an eternity in terms of CFB considering we don\u2019t really know if the current coaching staff for either team will still be around. No matter. We, the fans, will still be kicking around.\nFor now we have the basketball rivalry to keep us going. And dustups on social media.\nYour turn\nThis is exciting news and most definitely an opportunity to keep a regional rivalry alive. Let me know how you feel."

            "Adam Candee\nSpecial to the Detroit Free Press\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 Nearly an hour after finally raising the Stanley Cup above his graying hair, Alex Ovechkin stood a few feet back from the trophy as it sat on the ice.\nOvechkin simply watched. Here came T.J. Oshie with his wife and two young daughters, kneeling for photos with it. Jay Beagle\u2019s family stepped in next, his toddler son too short to see inside the Cup\u2019s bowl but desperately curious to look inside.\nAfter 13 years, Ovechkin gazed like a proud father at the team he led to a championship that found so many painful ways to elude him over his career. After a few minutes, a group of friends implored Ovechkin to join them. He dove in headlong, let out a yell and celebrated the first title in the 43-year history of the Washington Capitals.\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain how I feel,\u201d Ovechkin said on the ice after the game. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\nThe Capitals erased a third-period deficit in a furious three-minute stretch of the third period to win 4-3 over the expansion Vegas Golden Knights in Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Final at T-Mobile Arena. Lars Eller netted the game-winning goal with just less than eight minutes remaining to give Washington its fourth consecutive win.\nOvechkin scored a power-play goal to give Washington a brief lead in the second period. Nicklas Backstrom, his longtime running mate in Washington, flipped a saucer pass across the ice that Ovechkin buried for his franchise-record 15th goal of the playoffs.\nHe high-stepped directly to the boards after scoring, pumping his arms and showing the fire that marked his stellar postseason.\n\u201cOvi had a different step tonight,\u201d Oshie said. \u201cYou saw that a lot in these playoffs. You watch his shifts, you watch what he did tonight \u2014 he changed the momentum of the game at some points. That\u2019s your leader. That\u2019s what you want him to do.\u201d\nWith or without a Stanley Cup, Ovechkin\u2019s spot in the Hall of Fame would likely have been secured.\nNow, the Russian winger joins the greats of the game with his name etched in silver. A marvelous career with 607 goals receives the ultimate validation after many years of his Capitals teams flaming out under heavier expectations than they carried in 2018.\n\u201cWe did this together, but Alex has been through a lot,\u201d Capitals defenseman Matt Niskanen said. \u201cHe\u2019s taken some heat in the past so man, that feels good to see him go out there and reach the pinnacle. Really happy for him. He was a stud this spring. He led the charge, he produced \u2014 played hard, blocked shots, ran people over. He did it all for us.\u201d\nFor that effort, Ovechkin also earned the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player throughout the playoffs.\n\"It's just like a dream,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cIt was a hard, long season. We fight through it. We worked so hard through all the years and we were together.\u201d\nOvechkin received more help from his team than in past seasons. Braden Holtby\u2019s diving stick save in Game 2 bailed out Washington on the cusp of falling behind two games to Vegas. The return of Evgeny Kuznetsov in Game 3 sparked the Washington offense as it had through the first three rounds. Kuznetsov led all scorers in the playoffs with 32 points, including an assist on Washington\u2019s first goal of the night.\nWashington\u2019s second line harassed Vegas throughout the series, and Oshie and Backstrom were exceptional. They teamed up for 44 points during the Stanley Cup Playoffs and created chance after chance in the finals.\nWithout their captain, though, the Capitals are not lifting the Cup.\n\u201cHe was very comfortable and he was very confident, I think,\u201d Backstrom said of Ovechkin. \u201cHe was really calm. Everything was really good. It\u2019s impressive the way he scores (goals) and the way he worked out there. He was just a machine there in the playoffs.\u201d\nWhen he arrived in 2004 as the first overall pick in the draft, Ovechkin felt like the cornerstone to a Capitals revival. The team reached the final in 1998 but did not win a game against the Detroit Red Wings.\nOvechkin understood and embraced the expectations from the start \u2014 they came straight from the top, from owner Ted Leonsis.\n\u201cFunny story, I was at [Ted's] house and we kind of met up with his family,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cWe were swimming in the pool and he told me one day we're going to win it. It was the first year. I didn\u2019t even know the team.\n\u201cI knew he wants it so bad and this organization wants it so bad. It's nice to be part of it. it's nice to be in this organization all 13 years or 14, whatever. It was a tough time, but we fight through it and we get results. I'm going home to our families, our fans and it's just something special, you know.\""

            "We're still not fully sure whether Texas is officially \"back\" as everyone likes to proclaim, but with back-to-back wins over USC and TCU, coach Tom Herman and his team have certainly created the buzz to get the chatter going again. Saturday, the Longhorns will aim to keep the momentum rolling when they take on a foe who has been a thorn in their side in recent memory in Kansas State.\nWhile Texas is rolling at 3-1 on the year, Kansas State is 2-2, but the Wildcats have been outscored by 50 in their two losses against ranked opponents (Mississippi State and West Virginia). Coach Bill Snyder is clearly one of the game's best, but another loss here and it would absolutely be fair to wonder whether this team even makes a bowl.\nViewing information\nDate: Saturday, Sept. 29 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ET\nLocation: Bill Snyder Family Stadium -- Manhattan, Kansas\nTV: FS1 | Live stream: fuboTV (Try for free)\nStorylines\nTexas: Now that the Horns have won a few games, it's time to dissect what they can actually improve upon. The defense has turned a corner, but can the offense keep building consistency? Quarterback Sam Ehlinger is best when he's running and then hitting receivers Collin Johnson and Lil'Jordan Humphrey over the top. The problem is the offense is streaky in executing this. Can they fill in the gaps with the running game and have a better plan on third downs? Texas is seventh in the Big 12 with a 37.7 percent conversion rate.\nKansas State: The 'Cats sure could use a win to stop the bleeding, and who better than Texas? K-State is usually a much better team in the second half of the season, but this time it feels less certain. Snyder, in a rare moment of actual helplessness, exclaimed after a 35-6 loss at West Virginia, \"I can't coach a team that can't get six inches on a play.\" K-State's offense is discombobulated and brutally bad, and it can't rely on the grind-it-out approach like it has in years past.\nGame prediction, picks\nThis is a somewhat surprisingly difficult pick. History says go with Snyder as a home dog. However, Kansas State is a mess, and for the first time in a while, it genuinely feels like Snyder's back is against the wall. Still, history also says Texas coach Tom Herman is far better against the spread as an underdog. A lot of clashing trends here, but for the sake of making a pick, I'd sooner bet on Snyder in this situation than Herman.

            "In its customary style, Samsung pulled off a fantastic event to launch its second flagship mobile gadget in 2018, the Samsung Galaxy Note 9. The company made some impressive changes to the device, as it chose to focus on specific user needs and experience instead of a new design and look for the gadget. Samsung also upgraded the Galaxy Note 9's S-Pen, which now has a battery and can carry out tasks such as snap photographs or control the device's volume.\nAdditionally, we also got two important performance upgrades in the form of a variant with 8GB of RAM and increased battery capacity for the Galaxy Note 9. As tests and analysis of the gadget start, one thing that several folks will like to hear about is benchmarks. Well, if you're one of them then we've got just the post for you today. Take a look below for more details.\nSamsung Galaxy Note 9 Compared To The iPhone X, OnePlus 6 & Other Gadgets In Benchmarking Run\nWhile there's a great amount of debate, with some solid arguments in favor of the fact that benchmarks do not reflect real-world performance, they still demonstrate how well a device's core performance statistics such as the GPU and CPU will perform, especially under strenuous workloads.\nWith that in mind, we've got some of the first benchmarks for the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 today which don't paint a rosy picture for the device. Folks over at TomsGuide have carried out a handful of tests for the smartphone, running on 6GB of RAM. As a result, we've got two performance and two supplementary tests today.\nSamsung Galaxy Note 9 Vs iPhone X Vs OnePlus 6: GeekBench 4 And 3D Mark Results Show Clear Lag For The Note 9\nThe first two tests related to performance. We've got GeekBench 4, which focuses on holistic performance rather than segments. In the test, Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 scores 8,876 points - which are in the ballpark of what one would expect from the Snapdragon 845. The iPhone X and the OnePlus 6 on the other hand score 10,357 and 9,088 points respectively, making for a clear lead on the iOS device. Additionally, the OnePlus 6 in the test is running on 8GB of RAM, so the Note 9 and the device are pretty much on par.\nMoving towards 3D Mark Slingshot Extreme 3.1, the Galaxy Note 9, iPhone X and OnePlus 6 scored 4639, 4994, and 5124 points respectively. While the OnePlus 6 and iPhone X are somewhat in the same ballpark, the Note 9's score is more on par with the Samsung Galaxy S9+, which manages to score 4634 points,\nSamsung Galaxy Note 9 Vs iPhone X Vs OnePlus6: Display Tests Demonstrate Relatively Stronger Performance By The Note 9\nA display brightness test for the Galaxy Note 9 reveals that the device has a peak luminosity of 604 nits, considerably greater than the iPhone X and OnePlus 6 which score 547 each. However, in this metric, the Galaxy S9+ and LG's G7 ThinQ top out the Note 9, managing to score 630 and 900 nits in light output.\nFinally, the Galaxy Note 9 tops the iPhone X in color percentage, managing to capture 224% of sRGB against the iPhone's 128.6%. The OnePus 6 and the Galaxy S9+, on the other hand, capture 240.3% and 231% of the spectrum respectively.\nTo conclude looks like the Note 9 is a device that will provide you with the same level of performance as other flagship devices, but using it will not result in an extraordinary experience. Thoughts? Let us know what you think in the comments section below and stay tuned. We'll keep you updated on the latest."

        "articles": [
            "(Pocket-lint) - With top tier smartphones pushing higher and costing more, it's created something of a gap between the sub-\u00a3500 market dominated by the likes of Xiaomi and OnePlus. Apple addressed this by launching the iPhone XR, which offers a very similar experience to the flagship XS/XS Max.\nIt doesn't have all of the same sparkly features that the more expensive Galaxy S10 and S10+ phones have but it keeps the power without the price. Samsung has more recently added the S10 Lite to the picture, offering another rival to the selection of S10 phones.\nThank you to Vodafone UK for supplying us with this review unit.\nsquirrel_widget_147138\nPOCKET-LINT VIDEO OF THE DAY\nOur quick take On the whole, the Samsung Galaxy S10e is a powerful, palm-friendly smartphone that's ready to compete head-on with the iPhone XS and the Pixel 3. And in many ways it comes out on top. It would be easy to point at the S10e's feature list and say it's not as exciting as the Galaxy S10 or S10+. But having used it for a while, we've come to realise it's not really missing anything that matters - except maybe that telephoto zoom camera and the in-screen fingerprint sensor. We might've come in expecting to be critical of this lesser featured Galaxy phone, but we've come away wanting nothing. In many ways it's simply the smaller Galaxy option for those who don't want a giant phone. By no means is it the poor-man's Galaxy we thought it might be.\n4.5 stars - Pocket-lint recommended For All the power and performance of the bigger models\nNo curved screen edges is a good thing Against Only dual camera versus S10's triple system\nDesign is a bit toy-ish in some colours\nsquirrel_147138\nDesign\nExternal fingerprint sensor\nIP68 water and dust resistant\n142 x 70 x 7.9mm, 150g\nGlance at it from the front and you could be forgiven for thinking the S10e is part of the iPhone X family. It has that flat screen with rounded corners and shiny rounded metal edges. But there's enough here on a second glance to dispel those initial impressions.\nFirstly, there's no hint of that hefty notch that's become the silhouette synonymous with Apple's latest phones. Instead, the S10e has the single cutout camera within the display, similar to the Galaxy S10.\nSecondly, the bottom bezel (or 'chin' as we so often call it) isn't the same thickness as the edges. It's thicker, which means the bottom corners of the screen don't perfectly fit in with the rounded corners of the frame. It's not terrible to look at, by any means, but it would look better if the screen stretched a little further and pushed closer into the bottom corners. Still, it's easily ignorable once you get used to the phone.\nNow, because the Galaxy S10e doesn't have the in-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor that the S10 and S10+ have, Samsung had to come up with a way to include a fingerprint scanner without adding hefty thickness to the screen's frame. Rather than put one on to the back, beneath the camera like previous phones, Samsung has built it in to the right edge, in the wake/sleep button.\nIt's placement is well considered. It's not exactly at the natural thumb height, which means you're unlikely to press and unlock accidentally. You have to slide the phone slightly to get to it, which is a minor inconvenience that staves off constant irritation at unintended unlocks. What's more, the volume and Bixby buttons are on the opposite side, which is so much better than, say, Sony's method of cramming them all together on the same side.\nAs a whole, the S10e is a neat package. The glass very subtly curves towards the metal edges, creating an almost seamless look and feel, while the polished metal gives it a real high-end look. With that said, the baby blue-ish tint on the prism white model does give it a bit of a \"kids' phone\" vibe, as does the dual camera protrusion with its silver finish.\nScreen time\n5.8-inch AMOLED panel\n1080 x 2280 resolution, 438ppi\nHDR10+ compliant\nThe interesting thing about this display is that it's smaller, at 5.8-inches, compared to the 6.1- and 6.4-inch displays of the bigger S10 and S10+. That makes for neater one-handed holding. But while the S10e's is a lower resolution (Full HD+ versus Quad HD+) the difference in terms of detail is quite minimal, because it still has in impressive pixel density and is built using the same AMOLED technology as its siblings.\nHere's the crux: despite the S10 and S10+ having QHD displays, Samsung sets them to Full HD by default, so you have to go into the settings to max out the resolution, which we presume most people will not be doing.\nA benefit of this screen is that it's completely flat - which means you don't get any of the slight distortion towards the edges that you might get on the curved edges of its bigger family members.\nThis means it's actually really great for gaming, watching movies or just about anything else you want to do on your phone. It's the ideal mobile Netflix screen, and if you choose the right HDR equipped shows, it can look really stunning.\nPerformance, battery and One UI\nExynos 9820 processor\n6GB/8GB RAM\n128GB/256GB storage\n3,100mAh battery\nAndroid Pie-based One UI\nWe've spoken about the changes in Samsung's software already - take a look at our detailed feature, here - and whichever Galaxy S10 model you choose the software is identical. So we won't go into too much detail on that here, except to say that it's equal parts great and also not so great.\nPocket-lint\nWe love the fluidity of the animations, the new overall shape and feel of notifications, the recent apps and app drawer. We're not big fans of the new default app icons though, as they seem a big too colourful and child-like. What's more, certain apps and screens just have too much space in them. Swipe down on Settings, for example, and the top \"Settings\" menu name fills half the screen.\nThe important thing is that it all runs really smoothly and effortlessly using the new Exynos processor. It doesn't seem to matter what game or app you load, it does so without a stutter. It's very responsive and quick.\nSimilarly, battery life never caused us an issue either. It may only be 3,100mAh (compared to 3,400mAh and 4,100mAh in the other S10 models), but it's powering a smaller, lower resolution screen, and therefore this battery lasts comfortably through a busy work day. Just charge it every night and we don't foresee any battery life shortage issues. It's got generally all most people need.\nThere's versatility and convenience in charging too, with both wired and wireless charging options available. On the downside, however, Samsung seems to be lagging behind the likes of Oppo and Huawei when it comes to charging quickly. The S10e has 15W fast-charging - which isn't anything close to the rapid charging that either of the big Chinese companies offer. If you're a \"plug it in at night and leave it 'til morning\" kind of person then this won't bother you, but it won't fill up as much in that quick 15-20 mins before rushing out as you'd be able to achieve with Oppo's 50W Super VOOC charging or Huawei's 40W SuperCharge.\nCamera\nDual camera\n12MP dual-aperture primary\n16MP ultrawide\nHardware and performance of the camera on the S10e is just like the S10 and S10+ - except its missing the telephoto 2x zoom lens. That means you get the ultra-wide and the primary 12-megapixel wide camera.\nWe won't go into too much detail here, since we've already covered it in the Galaxy S10+, but results and performance is great in most conditions. There's plenty of fun to be had with AR emoji and the super slow-motion video.\nPocket-lint\nThe one place Samsung currently doesn't match its rivals is in night modes. With the likes of the Google Pixel, Huawei and Oppo phones all offering super night modes of various degrees, Samsung needs to advance here.\nStill, photos from the S10e in moderate-to-good light come out sharp and well balanced, although sometimes have a tendency to come out a little overexposed from the main camera.\nsquirrel_widget_147138\nTo recap On the whole, the Samsung Galaxy S10e is a powerful, palm-friendly smartphone that's ready to compete head-on with the iPhone XS and the Pixel 3. And in many ways it comes out on top.\nWriting by Cam Bunton. Editing by Stuart Miles."

            "The Umbrella Academy Season 1 Episode 3 Recap\nMaking the mood more dour than a family death is a deft talent, but the former members of The Umbrella Academy are far from ordinary in every way. Number 5\u2019s glass eye-focused quest fizzled before dodging gunfire from Hazel and Cha-Cha. A hail of bullets did little to stop 5\u2019s search, but the well-armed duo found a new location to light up: the Hargreeves mansion. Good thing all of the other Hargreeves children were there discussing Mom\u2019s role in Reginald\u2019s death. All of that action ripped down the curtain, revealing even more vulnerable bits for all involved.\nWe Need To Talk About Mom\nAllison shows the unmarked tape to Luther, revealing that Mom was at Reginald\u2019s side when he died. Luther instantly suspects that she poisoned their father, but Mom has no recollection of that night\u2019s events. She doesn\u2019t even remember Reginald dying next to her. Allison realizes that the trauma caused to Mom by being left alone in the mansion for 13 years is lost in all of the murder-mystery turmoil. This does little to deter Luther. The two leave to gather their siblings for a family meeting.\nAll the Hargreeves, sans Number 5, gather in the sitting room to view the tape. Diego immediately throws water on Luther\u2019s theory by pointing out that Mom was simply removing Reginald\u2019s monocle in the video. He further knows this because he took the monocle from her after the memorial service. The rest flip, but conversation soon turns back to Mom. Vanya points out that she was built as both a caretaker and a protector but her mechanical elements could be degrading beyond repair. Luther floats the idea of turning her off and is swiftly met with opposition from Diego as he recalls Mom\u2019s support while he battled a stutter as a child. The group take a vote with Vanya and Klaus supporting Diego while Allison sides with Luther. Allison declares the vote open until Number 5 weighs in, whenever that might be.\nObsessions & Regrets\nPersonal passion is something that Vanya has struggled with since writing her book five years ago. The tireless work of telling her family\u2019s story seems to be the last time she had any motivation. She arrives late to her orchestra rehearsal and tries to make small talk with the first chair violinist afterward. All that elicits is the same message she received from her father: Vanya doesn\u2019t possess anything special. The confrontation leads her to seek solace at Leonard\u2019s wood shop. The delighted man shows her his collection of handmade wood carvings, including one he made overnight of Vanya. He gives it to her and asks her out to dinner before revealing his knowledge of the Umbrella Academy\u2019s history.\nAllison has her own baggage to work through as it relates to her daughter. She\u2019s being forced to attend therapy in exchange for visitation rights with Claire due to her using her rumor power on her. Everything in her life came as a result of rumoring people, leading her to believe nothing in her life is genuine. Not even Luther is able to make her feel better. Elsewhere, Number 5 stakes out the Meritech doctor despite interruptions from Luther and Klaus. He watches the doc exchange a briefcase for an envelope and begins following him.\nAssault On House Hargreeves\nHazel and Cha-Cha\u2019s failure to take out Number 5 is met with pay reduction and the threat of their payoff decreasing for every additional day it takes them to complete their task. The financial kick in the butt and a tip from the donut shop waitress leads them to the doors of the Hargreeves mansion. They don their cartoon masks and open fire on Diego after exploring the house. The gunshots summon Luther and Allison to the fight while Mom sits oblivious to the attack.\nHazel is soon left alone with Vanya but Luther returns to defend her. The two big boys battle as Diego wounds Cha-Cha. Hazel takes down Luther long enough to escape before Cha-Cha drops a chandelier on him. Luther rises from the wreckage barely harmed but the twisting metal rips his clothing, revealing his Martian gorilla body. He runs away as his kin looks on in astonishment.\nWhere To Go From Here\nDiego realizes Mom\u2019s lack of reaction to the battle waged only feet from her. Her disassociation convinces Diego that she should be shut down. His hard exterior comes down momentarily as his stutter returns while saying goodbye to the only mother he ever knew. That sadness morphs into anger directed at Vanya. He labels her a liability because she isn\u2019t like them. Vanya leaves thanks to feeling unwelcome in her childhood home yet again. She winds up at Leonard\u2019s home, telling him she had nowhere else to go.\nHazel and Cha-Cha regroup at the hotel after the botched mission. They clearly have no knowledge of the Hargreeves\u2019 past as superheroes, but Hazel didn\u2019t leave empty handed. He brought Klaus along for the ride in the trunk of his car. The duo now have a hostage. Unfortunately, they took the most extra Hargreeves child of all.\nWhat do you think about The Umbrella Academy season 1 episode 3?

            "The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Nintendo will release a new version of the Nintendo Switch console in the second half of 2019, but there are few details about what might be improved outside of vague wording about an upgraded screen.\nBut what would make the Switch better?\nThe screen/power problem\nNintendo Switch comes with a weird design issue where it has to work as a portable and as a console, and resolution shifts depending on where you\u2019re playing and how much power the system is drawing. So you can say you want a larger screen, or a screen with a higher resolution, but doing so means you\u2019ll need to increase the overall power of the system while also dealing with battery life when the console is in portable mode.\nAnd the screen\u2019s resolution doesn\u2019t really matter when you\u2019re playing it attached to a television where it can draw wall current. I also doubt Nintendo is going to create a system that isn\u2019t 100 percent backward compatible with the previous version of the Switch; we\u2019re not going to see a system revamp that has games the older systems can\u2019t play. So we\u2019re not going to see a huge jump in any of these areas. A nice speed bump that would make it easier for developers to release games that don\u2019t struggle with the framerate would of course be awesome, but I\u2019m not holding my breath.\nMight we see a screen that\u2019s brighter and clearer, that looks more like a modern smart phone screen? Absolutely. But a jump in resolution or size is less likely.\nSo what\u2019s left?\nMy realistic wishlist for a new Switch includes a lot of small quality of life improvements. A slightly larger battery would be worth the weight, and Joy-Cons that are better suited for larger hands or longer sessions would be amazing. There are so many of us whose hands cramp when they play a demanding game in portable mode for more than a few minutes.\nMore internal storage so the mini SD card doesn\u2019t feel like such a mandatory immediate purchase with the system would also be great, and storage is cheap these games. The 32 GB that comes standard with Nintendo Switch now is just paltry when you look at the size of many games.\nOne of Nintendo\u2019s most valuable assets is the data it has collected about how people are playing their Switches, and that will likely lead to improvements in some of the most standard use cases. The kickstand, for instance, gets much more use than I would have expected and just isn\u2019t up to the task. Making something a bit beefier that could support the Switch while it\u2019s being played on the road seems like it would be a simple, but welcome, addition to the hardware.\nA boost to the system\u2019s Wi-Fi range would also be a major improvement over the existing system.\nThis is probably my own niche tastes coming through, but a built-in way to play the system in tate mode for vertically oriented games would be incredible. There are third-party add-ons that help with this issue, and games that support the feature, but so far there\u2019s no easy way to get everything aligned so it\u2019s easy to use. Imagine a kickstand that can hold the system in other landscape or portrait mode when you set it down. Check out the Flip Grip gallery below to see how Nintendo might tackle this issue.\nGrid View Fangamer\nFangamer\nFangamer\nFangamer\nFangamer\nFangamer\nSo is that all?\nProbably! Getting a hardware refresh two years after launch doesn\u2019t seem that strange these days, but Nintendo won\u2019t want to mess with a good thing and fragment the market. So expect a slightly better screen, maybe some more storage and a few other basic quality of life changes that will make the new Switch better, without making it feel like all-new hardware.\nBut who knows? Nintendo never does the expected thing \u2014 it\u2019s not like any of us saw Labo coming before it was announced \u2014 which means the reported new hardware might veer off into some new direction. But I bet Nintendo is going to play it safe and release a system that\u2019s better than the original, but not radically so.\nAlso, if they could make the Joy-Cons a little quieter when they rumble? That would be fine."

Defensive ends Jonathan Woodard (concussion) and Charles Harris (calf) have been ruled out for the game against the Detroit Lions.\nIt\u2019s looking more encouraging for DE Cameron Wake (knee), who fully practiced Friday, but was listed as questionable for Sunday\u2019s game. Also having a questionable designation were CB Bobby McCain and safety T. J. McDonald, both with knee injuries, although they were full participants in practice.\nRounding out the defense, DE Andre Branch (knee) and FS Reshad Jones (shoulder) were listed as FP and had no injury designations assigned to them, indicating they\u2019ll be available to play.\nOn the offense, as previously reported, QB Ryan Tannehill (right shoulder) is officially listed as out and there is a question about him being available Thursday night against the Texans. The only other player with a designation was WR DeVante Parker (quadricep) as questionable, but he fully practiced all week.\nReported as FP were WR Jakeem Grant (shoulder/hamstring) and OT Jesse Davis (elbow). Tight end A.J. Derby (foot) practiced on a limited basis Friday after being a full participant all week. None of these players had a designation.\nRunning back Theo Riddick (knee) of the Detroit Lions, who did not practice all week, has been declared out for Sunday. Also on offense, offensive guard T.J.

            "This post is part of Polyarchy , an independent blog produced by the political reform program at New America , a Washington think tank devoted to developing new ideas and new voices.\nI\u2019m glad we\u2019re once again debating the antiquated Electoral College, inspired by Elizabeth Warren\u2019s recent call to abolish the vintage 1787 Rube Goldberg-style invention for picking a president at a time when popular democracy was highly suspect and slave states were fearful of losing their power based on population alone.\nAbolishing the Electoral College is a modern-democratic-principles slam dunk: Every vote should count the same, no matter where you live. Absent a baroque defense of hyper-federalization or a nakedly partisan argument dressed in the breeches and waistcoat of blind traditionalism, there is no good case for the Electoral College. Rather, the more interesting question is what to replace it with.\nThere\u2019s a very good reason no other democracy has ever copied our cockamamie system: It makes zero sense\nThe most popular replacement proposal is a direct popular vote: Whoever gets the most votes nationwide wins. Certainly, this is an improvement over the Electoral College. But it still employs the worst form of voting \u2014 simple plurality. I say worst form because simple plurality means a candidate does not have to win a majority of votes to win the election, and leaves open the possibility that the least-preferred candidate wins because two other candidates split the remaining vote. Or, as more commonly happens, plurality elections marginalize third parties as spoilers, and campaigns become simply lesser-of-two-evils contests.\nThe two-round system, which most presidential democracies use, is an obvious improvement over the single-round plurality system. In the second round, the winning candidate mathematically has to appeal to a majority. This generally produces more moderate winners than simple plurality elections, which generate more extreme winners and more divisive politics. Eric Holder, among others, has proposed the two-round system.\nFrance as a case study in the two-round presidential election\nTo understand how a two-round system might work, consider the 2017 French presidential election, which can illustrate both the benefits and the dangers of a two-round system. In the first-round election, centrist Emmanuel Macron got 24 percent of the vote and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen got 21 percent, narrowly coming in second.\nIn the second round, Macron won handily, defeating Le Pen 66 percent to 33 percent. In a head-to-head contest, unclouded by long-standing partisan affiliations, the French people solidly rejected the far-right populist, and France wound up with the candidate that most citizens could ultimately agree on.\nThe adage in France goes like this: On the first ballot, the voters select. On the second ballot, they elect. Or, put another way, on the first ballot voters choose; on the second they eliminate.\nThe 2017 French election shows a benefit of the two-round system: It created space for a shake-up of the existing ossified party structure. France\u2019s two long-standing major political parties, the center-left Socialists and the center-right Republicans, had lost considerable support. In the two-round system, it was possible for a party to emerge without being dismissed as a spoiler.\nBut things could have easily gone differently. The fourth-place finisher was Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, a far-left populist, who won just short of 20 percent of the vote. But M\u00e9lenchon might have done a little better, Macron a little worse, and the French people might have been left to choose between a far-left populist and a far-right populist.\nA two-round system encourages more candidates but then requires a high level of strategic voting for voters, who might have complicated preferences about who they think can win, versus who they\u2019d most like to win.\nMoreover, Macron may have won with 66 percent of the general election vote, but the large margin was not so much a reflection of his broad-based popularity as it was Le Pen\u2019s unpopularity. On his own, his popularity has fallen after he tried to claim a broader mandate than his support deserved.\nWhy ranked-choice voting is superior to the two-round system\nA better alternative would be ranked-choice voting for president. As the name suggests, ranked-choice voting lets voters rank their choices. Voters mark their first choice candidate first, their second choice candidate second, then their third-choice candidate third, and so on. Easy as 1-2-3. Think of it as a political listicle: Candidates in this election, ranked.\nThe votes are then tallied as follows: If one candidate has an outright majority of first-place votes, that candidate wins. But if no candidate has a majority in the first round, second-choice preferences come into play. The candidate with the fewest number of first-choice votes is eliminated, and voters who had ranked that candidate first have their votes transferred to the candidate they ranked second. This continues until a single candidate gathers a majority, with subsequent preferences transferring as candidates get eliminated from the bottom up.\nRanked-choice voting improves on the two-round runoff elections in the following ways. First, it is more likely to produce a broadly acceptable winner. Ranked-choice voting rewards candidates who can appeal most broadly, because candidates compete to be voters\u2019 second and third choices as well as their first. By contrast, in a two-round system, it\u2019s quite possible for the two candidates with the most dedicated but not necessarily broadest support to advance to the final round, recreating the lesser-of-two-evils problem.\nSecond, a two-round system demands complex strategic calculations for voters, who face a trade-off between who they want to win and who they think can make it to the second round. This can lead to very different outcomes based on small variations in polling. California\u2019s top-two primary displayed this problem last year, when Democratic voters struggled to coordinate around the candidate most likely to advance to the second round and avoid splitting a crowded field and allowing two Republicans to advance to the general election.\nThe complexities of these strategic calculations can also invite political operatives to support \u201closer\u201d or \u201cdummy\u201d candidates designed to fracture the field, confuse voters, and pull away crucial support from frontrunners in crowded fields (as also happened in California). The ranked-choice voting renders this strategy pointless. There are no spoilers in ranked-choice voting.\nThird, the two-round election can also lead to unintended vote-splitting among candidates competing for similar voters, denying voters the ability to find agreement through ranking. In ranked-choice voting, voters can vote sincerely. They don\u2019t need to worry if they are wasting their votes. And nobody has an incentive to run loser candidates.\nFourth, an instant runoff is both less costly for governments (one election costs less than two) and for voters (one visit to the polls takes less time than two). Voter turnout often declines in a second round, either because voters\u2019 preferred candidate didn\u2019t advance or because voters simply lose interest. The voters most likely to drop off in the second round are the least educated.\nAdditionally, if we\u2019re going to incorporate ranked-choice voting into how we select presidents, we should also use it for the primaries.\nAll else equal, a popular vote is better than the Electoral College (for obvious reasons). And a two-round popular vote is better than a single-round plurality popular vote, because by requiring the winner to earn a true majority, it avoids the problem of extreme minority candidates.\nBut ranked-choice voting is superior to the two-round system because it simultaneously maximizes voter participation and broad-based coalition-building. It also allows voters to vote sincerely and is most likely to avoid perverse outcomes.\nWe know more today about elections than we did in 1787. Our institutions should reflect that.\nThe Framers were political scientists with no existing model for electing a president and tremendous ambivalence over what they wanted out of an executive. They were practical politicians trying to work out an acceptable compromise.\nWe can forgive them for coming up with a sub-optimal approach given the urgency and limited time and political constraints. But with 230 years of experience in modern democracy, we now have plenty of data on what works best.\nNo electoral system is perfect. But some are demonstrably better than others. Rather than limit ourselves to an antiquated and inferior tradition, we should strive for the best possible. National popular ranked-choice voting is the best possible way of electing a president."

            "Former Los Angeles Lakers forward Julius Randle agrees to sign with the New Orleans Pelicans. (AP Photo)\nNearly an hour and a half after it was announced that the Los Angeles Lakers renounced Julius Randle, the forward agreed to sign with the New Orleans Pelicans. Randle\u2019s deal is worth $18 million for two years, according to a report by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski.\nThe news surfaced around 4 p.m. Pacific time and followed an interesting Monday of free agency action. Earlier in the day, former Pelicans point guard Rajon Rondo agreed to sign a one-year, $9 million deal with the Los Angeles Lakers.\nAs it relates to Randle, ESPN\u2019s Wojnarowski reported all-NBA Pelicans forward Anthony Davis played a large part in the recruitment. The next big question revolves around free agent DeMarcus Cousins.\nGod is great!!!! We are so excited to be apart of @PelicansNBA ready for some gumbo & beignets !!! Thanks everyone for your love and support! \u2014 Kendra Randle (@KendraRandle_) July 2, 2018\nLast year, at age 23, Randle averaged 16.1 points and eight rebounds per game. His progression since he was drafted out of Kentucky with the No. 7 pick in the 2014 NBA Draft raised eyes in his fourth NBA season.\nThe notable free agent nugget that remains as it relates to the New Orleans Pelicans is where Cousins will go. Not only are there questions surrounding how he will return from the achilles he tore in January, but analysts have also waffled on what type of contract they expect him to sign.\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\u2022 Massive basketball brawl results in 13 players getting ejected\n\u2022 LeBron effect: Lakers season ticket prices skyrocket\n\u2022 Mexico coach calls Neymar \u2018an embarrassment\u2019 for soccer at World Cup\n\u2022 Cavs owner Dan Gilbert pens touching tribute to LeBron"

            "Medal of Honor awarded to soldier who sacrificed himself to save others\nWashington \u2014 President Trump presented the Medal of Honor Wednesday to the family of Army Staff Sgt. Travis Atkins. It's the military's highest award for bravery in battle and Atkins died so other soldiers could live.\nIt was on the first of June 12 years ago that Atkins called from Iraq to tell his parents he was about to take his men out on a mission.\n\"He did say that he was sorry he had forgotten to get something in the mail for me for Mother's Day,\" said his mother Elaine Atkins.\nJust hours later, Army officers arrived to tell them their son was dead.\nArmy Sgt. Travis Atkins with his parents, Jack and Elaine Atkins, during a visit to see him at Fort Drum, N.Y., in 2006. The Atkins Family/Department of Defense\n\"After we spoke to the chaplain, I went to the mailbox and there was a little package from Travis with a Mother's Day card for me and a Father's Day card for Jack. The card said 'Thanks for everything' and it just brought it home,\" Elaine said.\nIt was only when they met with Sand Aijo and other soldiers in Atkins' unit that they found out how he died.\n\"He had definitely sacrificed himself so that we could live,\" Aijo said.\nAijo was the machine gunner in their humvee and he watched as Atkins and the team's medic got out to search two men they suspected of planting roadside bombs.\n\"That's when Travis started to actually engage in a form of hand to hand combat with this man. Travis bear hugged the man, lifted him off the ground and slammed him down,\" Aijo said.\nAijo didn't realize it yet, but the man had pulled the pin on a grenade to detonate a suicide vest. Atkins was wrestling himself into position to shield his men from the blast.\nWhen Aijo found out Atkins was going to receive the Medal of Honor, he said it felt good to see there was a \"grateful nation\" that was as thankful as he was.\nAtkins' father, a Vietnam veteran, says none of that surprised him because he had talked to his son about being a soldier.\n\"We talked about the responsibility of what you owe to people who are serving under you, and what you need to do to protect them,\" Jack Atkins said.\nThe medal was presented to Atkins' son Trevor Oliver, who was 10 when his father died. It is, of course, this nation's highest honor, but perhaps not Travis Atkins' greatest achievement.\n\"The real reward is what your men think of you,\" Jack said.\nThat was on full display when those who served with him -- privates to colonels -- were asked to stand.\nUS President Donald Trump presents a posthumous Medal of Honor for US Army Staff Sergeant Travis Atkins, to his surviving son Trevor Oliver, during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC, March 27, 2019.

The 50-over tournament features six teams. Here\u2019s all you need to know about the tournament:\nWho are the participating teams and what is the format?\nThe six participating teams are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Hong Kong. The teams are split into two groups. Group A consists of India, Pakistan and Hong Kong while Group B has Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Each team plays the other in the same group once. The top two teams from each group will qualify for the second stage, called the Super Four.\nThe four teams in this stage will play each other once. The top two will qualify for the final in Dubai on September 28.\nThe tournament reverts to the 50-over format. The previous edition, in 2016, was played as a Twenty20 tournament, in order to prepare the teams for the ICC World T20 that followed after the tournament. This time though the change in the format should help the teams (save for Hong Kong) prepare for the 50-over World Cup in England next year.\nWhat happened at the qualifying tournament?\nWith India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan having sealed their spots, for the sixth spot, the 2018 Asia Cup Qualifier tournament was held in Malaysia from August 29 to September 6, 2018. The participating teams were Hong Kong, UAE, Malaysia, Oman, Nepal, Malaysia and Singapore. UAE topped the group with 8 points while Hong Kong came second. The two teams qualified for the final.\nRain reduced the final to 24 overs a side. UAE managed 176 for 9 batting first. Hong Kong sneaked through by two wickets in the final over to seal their qualification for the main tournament.\nWhat is the status of Hong Kong\u2019s matches?\nHong Kong doesn\u2019t have official one-day international status. The team had earlier lost its ODI status after finishing poorly in the (50-over) World Cup Qualifiers earlier this year. However, the ICC has confirmed that all of Hong Kong\u2019s matches in the 2018 Asia Cup will be recognised as official one-day internationals.\nWhat is India and Pakistan\u2019s head-to-head record in the Asia Cup?\nSince the tournament\u2019s inception in 1984, India and Pakistan have played each other 12 times, with India winning 6 (5 ODIs plus 1 T20) and losing 5. In the 2018 edition, there is the prospect of the two sides meeting up to three times, first in the group stage, at the Super Four and the final, should they finish in the top two.\nSchedule\nGroup Stage\nSeptember 15: Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka\nSeptember 16: Pakistan vs Hong Kong\nSeptember 17: Sri Lanka vs Afghanistan\nSeptember 18: India vs Hong Kong\nSeptember 19: India vs Pakistan\nSeptember 20: Bangladesh vs Afghanistan\nSuper Four\nSeptember 21: Group A winner vs Group B runner-up\nSeptember 21: Group B winner vs Group A runner-up\nSeptember 23: Group A winner vs Group A runner-up\nSeptember 23: Group B Winner vs Group B runner-up\nSeptember 25: Group A winner vs Group B winner\nSeptember 26: Group A runner-up vs Group B runner-up\nSeptember 28: Final"

            "NASCAR at Indianapolis Motor Speedway: starting lineup breakdown\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Regan Smith didn't realize when he said he would substitute for Kasey Kahne that he would do so without even taking a lap in a car.\nSmith, who hasn't competed in a race all season as he moved to the Fox Sports broadcast team, got a call Thursday afternoon while on the golf course asking if he could replace Kahne, who is skipping the race to determine the cause of his recent excessive dehydration issues that left him nauseous and having difficulty seeing last week at Darlington.\nBecause of rain Saturday at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, drivers will race with no practice and no qualifying whether that is Sunday or Monday.\nSmith joked maybe he would sit in the Leavine Family Racing No. 95 car and have them make some engine noises so he could prepare for the race.\n\"I was literally on the golf course when [the team owner] called me,\" Smith said. \"And then I found out about the weather forecast. ... This could be fun here.\n\"Of all the Turn 1s that are challenging, Indy is one of the most challenging Turn 1s that we have because it is so narrow and because guys go three- or four-wide.\"\nSmith is no stranger to the substituting role. The \"super sub\" has filled in for Dale Earnhardt Jr., Tony Stewart, Kurt Busch, Kyle Larson and Aric Almirola since 2012.\n\"Call me whatever you want to call me as long as I get to drive occasionally,\" Smith said.\nSmith will start 27th in the Brickyard 400. Here is how they will line up for the Brickyard 400:\n1. Kyle Busch (Joe Gibbs Racing No. 18 Toyota): He won back-to-back Brickyards in 2015 and 2016 -- and possibly could have made it three consecutive if not for tangling with Martin Truex Jr. last year. He is 39 points up on Kevin Harvick for the regular-season title, and a 15th-place finish or better clinches that for him.\n2. Kevin Harvick (Stewart-Haas Racing No. 4 Ford): The 2003 Brickyard winner has back-to-back sixth-place finishes. He'll be a threat.\n3. Martin Truex Jr. (Furniture Row Racing No. 78 Toyota): Truex has just one career top-5 at Indianapolis. But if NASCAR wants a great storyline, either Truex or Daniel Suarez wins Sunday (or Monday if it rains).\n4. Kurt Busch (Stewart-Haas Racing No. 41 Ford): Busch's lone top-5 finish at the Brickyard came in his first race -- in 2001. This is not one of his best tracks -- his average finish is 15.6.\n5. Joey Logano (Team Penske No. 22 Ford): Logano has led 55 laps in the past five Brickyards and has three top-5s to show for it. Expect him to be in the mix.\n6. Brad Keselowski (Team Penske No. 2 Ford): Keselowski is riding the momentum of a Darlington finish. He has led plenty of laps at Indy (99 in eight starts) but has just one top-5.\n7. Kyle Larson (Chip Ganassi Racing No. 42 Chevrolet): He struggled at Indy last year (he started 25th and finished 28th) but he's traditionally strong at the track. Many wish he would run the Indy 500 someday.\n8. Clint Bowyer (Stewart-Haas Racing No. 14 Ford): Bowyer definitely wishes it was Richmond for him to get momentum into the playoffs. He has just one top-15 finish at Indy in his past five starts.\n9. Ryan Blaney (Team Penske No. 12 Ford): Blaney has failed to finish his past two Brickyard starts. He did already have good news this week -- Body Armour has increased its sponsorship to be a primary for at least three races next year and will be on the car Sunday.\n10. Denny Hamlin (Joe Gibbs Racing No. 11 Toyota): Hamlin had three consecutive top-5 Brickyard finishes before finishing 17th last year. Maybe it's a good thing Hamlin isn't starting up front. He has started from the pole in three of his past four races and has posted finishes of 13th, eighth and 10th in those events.\n11. Chase Elliott (Hendrick Motorsports No. 9 Chevrolet): He has one top-15 finish in three starts at Indianapolis. This one could be a struggle.\n12. Aric Almirola (Stewart-Haas Racing No. 10 Ford): Almirola has never led a lap and has no finish better than 13th at the Brickyard. But he's in the playoffs, and that's what counts.\n13. Erik Jones (Joe Gibbs Racing No. 20 Toyota): He led 10 laps but didn't finish the race a year ago. He struggled here in Xfinity with no top-20 finish in any of his three starts.\n14. Jimmie Johnson (Hendrick Motorsports No. 48 Chevrolet): A four-time Brickyard winner, Johnson isn't guaranteed a spot in the playoffs. If someone outside the current top-16 win and Alex Bowman earns 20 (and possibly 19) more points than Johnson, the seven-time Cup champion would miss the playoffs. Don't expect that to happen. But no one expected Johnson to be on the bubble.\n15. Alex Bowman (Hendrick Motorsports No. 88 Chevrolet): Bowman, who hasn't raced at Indy since 2015, could race his way into the playoffs with a win or earning 20 (and possibly 19) more points than 16.\n16. Ricky Stenhouse Jr. (Roush Fenway Racing No. 17 Ford): Stenhouse doesn't have a top-10 in his five Brickyard starts. He probably wishes he can race the temporary IMS dirt track again, as he did Thursday night.\n17. Ryan Newman (Richard Childress Racing No. 31 Chevrolet): : Newman is one of four drivers outside the top-16 who have won the Brickyard and need a win to make it into the playoffs. He has shown speed in recent weeks (qualifying top-10 in five of the past eight races). But he'll need a perfect race to make the playoffs.\n18. Austin Dillon (Richard Childress Racing No. 3 Chevrolet): Dillon has two top-10s in five career Brickyard starts. He has no stress, though, just as he hasn't had stress for the entire season since winning the Daytona 500.\n19. Paul Menard (Wood Brothers Racing No. 21 Ford): Menard's only Cup win came in the 2011 Brickyard 400. He's had 257 starts since then, the longest winless streak of any full-time driver.\n20. Daniel Suarez (Joe Gibbs Racing No. 19 Toyota): Suarez probably has had a tough time as it is likely that Truex replaces him next year at JGR. He could end up at Leavine Family Racing, but no one would blame him for testing the waters. He was 20th in the points last year and 20th this year. Indy is a good track for him -- he was seventh in this race last year and posted a third and seventh in his two Xfinity starts.\n21. Jamie McMurray (Chip Ganassi Racing No. 1 Chevrolet): McMurray won the 2010 Indy 500 and is coming off a ninth-place finish at Darlington. Can he capture the magic, win and make the playoffs? He probably has the best shot of anyone.\n22. William Byron (Hendrick Motorsports No. 24 Chevrolet): Byron is 1-for-1 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway as he won the Xfinity race at the track last year.\n23. Chris Buescher (JTG Daugherty Racing No. 37 Chevrolet): Buescher has a 14th and a ninth in his two Brickyard starts so don't be surprised to see him flirting with a top-10.\n24. AJ Allmendinger (JTG Daugherty Racing No. 47 Chevrolet): He has two top-10 finishes at Indy -- not counting his seventh-place finish in the 2013 Indianapolis 500.\n25. David Ragan (Front Row Motorsports No. 38 Ford): Ragan has finished 30th or worse in four of his past five Brickyard 400s. But he sat on the pole in 2011 and started third in 2015.\n26. Michael McDowell (Front Row Motorsports No. 34 Ford): McDowell seeks his first top-15 finish at the Brickyard.\n27. Regan Smith (Leavine Family Racing No. 95 Chevrolet): Smith replaces Kasey Kahne, who is sitting out until he can understand what is causing him to be dehydrated to the point of being nauseated and having trouble seeing, which happened last weekend at Darlington. Smith has not turned a lap in any race car this year.\n28. Bubba Wallace (Richard Petty Motorsports No. 43 Chevrolet): Wallace has a 23rd and 14th in his two Xfinity starts at the track. He has never competed in a Cup race at Indy.\n29. Matt Kenseth (Roush Fenway Racing No. 6 Ford): Kenseth has finished a trio of second-place Brickyard finishes. He has five top-5s in his past seven Brickyard starts. Glory days.\n30. Ty Dillon (Germain Racing No. 13 Chevrolet): Dillon won an Xfinity race at the track in 2014. He finished 19th in this race a year ago. A 19th on Sunday would probably make him smile.\n31. Matt DiBenedetto (Go Fas Racing No. 32 Ford): One of DiBenedetto's career highlights was an eighth-place finish at the Brickyard last year. He announced Friday that he won't be back in the car next season.\n32. Ross Chastain (Premium Motorsports No. 15 Chevrolet): Chastain probably is looking more forward to racing an Xfinity car for Ganassi again next week than he is the Brickyard 400. But the learning experience will be important Sunday.\n33. Cole Whitt (TriStar Motorsports No. 72 Chevrolet): If this team can stay out of the bottom three among the charter teams (34th-36th), that makes the charter more valuable when it goes back to Front Row. Right now, it's seven points ahead of 34th StarCom and 13 points ahead of 35th BK Racing (now owned by Front Row)\n34. Landon Cassill (StarCom Racing No. 00 Chevrolet): This team also is looking to stay out of the bottom three -- if a charter is in the bottom three for three consecutive years, NASCAR can pull the charter.\n35. J.J. Yeley (BK Racing No. 23 Toyota): This will be Yeley's eighth start at the Brickyard. Make that eighth NASCAR start. He was ninth in the 1998 Indianapolis 500.\n36. David Starr (Rick Ware Racing No. 51 Chevrolet): This is Starr's first Cup race of 2018.\n37. Jeffrey Earnhardt (Gaunt Brothers Racing No. 96 Toyota): For the first time since the first five weeks, Earnhardt is racing in back-to-back events.\n38. Reed Sorenson (Premium Motorsports No. 7 Chevrolet): Sorenson is the youngest pole winner for any Cup race at the Brickyard. When he won the 2007 pole, he was 21 years, 5 months and 24 days old.\n39. Timmy Hill (Carl Long Motorsports No. 66 Toyota): This is Hill's fourth start at the Brickyard. He has been running at the finish of the previous three, including a 14th-place finish last year.\n40. B.J. McLeod (Rick Ware Racing No. 52 Chevrolet): He competed in this race last year and finished 32nd."

            "Suburbanites are more fired up than rural voters\nThe most significant harbinger from the Ohio race may not be the narrow margin, but the turnout gap between the most and least heavily populated parts of a district that absorbs the close-in suburbs of Columbus and rural stretches of central Ohio.\nIn both Franklin County, which includes Columbus, and Delaware County, the fast-growing suburb just north of Ohio\u2019s capital, 42 percent of voters turned out. But in the five more lightly populated counties that round out the district, turnout ranged from 27 to 32 percent.\nThis is an ominous sign for Republicans: The highest-income and best-educated elements of the electorate \u2014 those deeply uneasy with President Trump \u2014 are showing the most interest in voting. Defending a few dozen districts that are either more heavily urban or feature a similar demographic mix as Ohio\u2019s 12th District, Republicans will need to find a way to win back suburbanites or better galvanize rural voters. If they do not, their House majority will slip away."

        "label": "Review of 'No Shame' by Lily Allen",
        "articles": [
            "It\u2019s hard not to heave a weary sigh as Lily Allen\u2019s fourth album gets under way. From the title down, No Shame has been trumpeted as a ballsy return to form following 2014\u2019s Sheezus \u2013 and yet the opening track, Come on Then, sounds remarkably like something off that album. A relative of Wind Your Neck In or URL Badman without the latter\u2019s acerbic wit, it\u2019s a prickly, defensive whinge about \u201cthe socials\u201d, their cyclical relationship with the tattle mags and tabloids and Allen\u2019s depiction therein.\nOf course, Allen has plenty to feel prickly about \u2013 growing up in public, she\u2019s been given the kind of hard time that Twitter\u2019s grimmer corners and sidebar-of-shame authors seem to reserve exclusively for young women who make their voices heard. Nevertheless, as she demands to know why what\u2019s written about her is \u201cso far from the truth\u201d, it\u2019s hard to assuage the feeling that you\u2019ve heard this all before, and not just from her. Modern pop is already waist-deep in songs bemoaning haters, deceitful journalists and the disparity between public perception and reality. It\u2019s the equivalent of 70s rock stars complaining that life on the road was lonely and tedious: a complaint about a downside of stardom that\u2019s been repeated to the point of cliche.\nA groan of \u201chere we go again\u201d is no way to start any album, especially one heralded as a big comeback. Yet the rest of No Shame is not like its opening track at all. At its centre are a suite of songs depicting in unsparing detail the collapse of Allen\u2019s marriage, and the emotional tone shifts continually: from self-loathing to blame-laying, from denial to melancholy, nostalgia and regret. It never otherwise deals in prickly defensiveness; Family Man and What You Waiting For are not songs from which the author emerges covered in glory.\nIt all feels very realistic. You listen to Allen accusing and admitting, contradicting and doubling back on herself, filled with second thoughts, and think: yeah, that\u2019s probably exactly what divorce is like. It would be a hard listen were it not for the fact that the music is so great: tropical house shot in soft-focus and slow-motion, orchestrated 70s singer-songwriter ballads, every melody and chorus finished to a uniformly high standard. It\u2019s the negative image of Coldplay\u2019s similarly themed Ghost Stories, an album that moped around in its dressing gown, too listless and depressed to come up with a memorable tune.\nElsewhere, her confidence shows up in other ways. Scattering your album with guest spots from UK rappers \u2013 Giggs, Meridian Dan, Lady Chann \u2013 could look like a desperate lunge for contemporaneity, but it never does. Allen\u2019s early work bore the sonic hallmarks of an artist who\u2019d spent their life with \u201cone foot in the rave\u201d, as she puts it on Trigger Bang, immersed in London\u2019s urban music past and present: it takes an innate understanding of reggae, ska, calypso and hip-hop to blend them so successfully into the pop confection of 2006\u2019s Alright, Still. Similarly, on No Shame, she seems to know exactly what to do with her guest stars: their appearances feel integral, never grafted on; the moment Lady Chann and Allen start singing together on Waste is pure joy.\nOn Three, meanwhile, she\u2019s confident enough to even try a gushy paean to her kids, something all rock and pop artists should be contractually obliged not to do \u2013 if Stevie Wonder at the zenith of his powers couldn\u2019t get the baby snaps out without making you want to die of embarrassment, you\u2019ve got no chance. So it proves. Writing a song from the point of view of a toddler proves impossible to do without sounding cutesy; the piano ballad accompaniment is the least interesting on the album. Pushing Up Daisies meanwhile, hymns a new relationship with til-death-us-do-part fealty. The lyrical update of When I\u2019m 64 is very witty \u2013 will you still need me, it ponders, \u201cwhen we\u2019re just a strain on the NHS \u2026 when I\u2019m a Daily Mail-reading know-what\u2019s-best\u201d \u2013 but feels weird after seven tracks that depict a marriage falling apart in unforgiving depth. It\u2019s as if Ingmar Bergman\u2019s punishing Scenes from a Marriage had ended with the cast putting paper hats on and doing the conga.\nSo, No Shame is a slightly odd album, where the horror of divorce is laid bare next to cheery pledges of everlasting love, where stuff wrapped in cliche coexists with songs that are painfully honest and revealing. Still, as Allen would doubtless point out, she never claimed to be perfect. What she is, No Shame strongly suggests, is ready and able to tough it out."

        "label": "Joel Embiid vs Raptors",
        "articles": [
            "There are not many players in the league who can claim to have flummoxed Joel Embiid through the first three seasons of his career. The Sixers' franchise player is a walking nightmare for opponents \u2014 he draws fouls at an elite rate, he's as big and strong as anybody in the league, and he has the touch of a player half his size. You can't put him on the line, you can't concede mid-range jumpers, and most of the time you can't hope to stand him up in the post.\nToronto's Marc Gasol, however, is not like most of the matchups Embiid faces around the league. No one this side of Al Horford has proven better equipped to stop Embiid since he entered the league.\nAs a continuation of our series looking at individual matchups before the series begins in Toronto, let's take a look at what the numbers say about Embiid vs. Gasol, the competing interests in Toronto and Philadelphia, and where we might all end up when the dust settles.\nToronto's trade for Gasol was made with this matchup in mind\nGrabbing Gasol at the trade deadline this year was a statement of intent from the Raptors. Kawhi Leonard is an unrestricted free agent this offseason, and Toronto has spent all season trying to convince him to stick around for the long-term despite the noise that he will flee for Los Angeles come July. Rather than playing it safe and hoping the incumbents would be enough to do so, the Raptors sought out an upgrade to make a real run at the title this year.\n\"When you look at what Milwaukee did or the 76ers did or Toronto did prior to the trade deadline, everybody loaded up,\" Brett Brown said Thursday. \"It was an arms race for the Eastern Conference Championship. Gasol was an incredible acquisition for them, he really fits perfectly to the point where after the trade was made, they're the best three-point shooting team in the NBA.\"\nTo get there, the Raptors will have to get through Embiid's Sixers. And while Gasol's skill package is useful for any team, the veteran center is particularly important if your goal is to slow down the big man from Cameroon.\nThe NBA only provides matchup data for the last two seasons, but Embiid's numbers against Gasol when he was still with the Grizzlies were an absolute trainwreck relative to his lofty standards. Embiid is 10/29 from the field on possessions where Gasol has covered him the last two seasons, a drop-off of 14 percentage points from his season averages over that time. It is in many ways a product of his shot selection \u2014 Embiid is 0/9 on threes with Gasol guarding him, which we'll revisit in a second.\nIf you ask the head coach, Embiid's struggles against Gasol are pretty easy to understand.\n\"His experience, combined with his sort of physical gifts and intellect, make it sort of [an] apples for apples body type matchup. It's not like you have [Jarrett Allen] on him,\" Brown said Thursday. \"You get to the other end of the floor, Marc is an incredible quarterback passing from wherever. Passing out of pick-and-roll, passing in trail, he doesn't to me at this stage of the career need to be a high-volume shot guy, he's a great distributor.\"\nThose two halves of the whole are not disconnected. Gasol can step out and shoot threes and attack you as a passer, which puts stress on Embiid on the defensive end of the floor. Embiid has thrived against some of his matchups with big, traditional centers, but most of them don't have the passing and/or shooting talent of Gasol.\nHow does Gasol present problems?\nThe short version of the answer \u2014 it's going to take some problem-solving from the coaching staff and the players on the floor.\n\"To feel you're just going to turn out JJ, throw the ball to JJ, and dump it into Joel with Gasol on him would be pretty naive. You need a greater plan than that,\" Brown said. \"I gotta do a good job of helping free Joel up.\"\nIt will be up to Toronto to decide how they want to defend Embiid with Gasol on the floor, but I can't imagine it will be all that different than most gameplans look against him at this point. When Gasol was in Memphis, they were aggressive leaving Embiid open from behind the three-point line, and he wasn't able to make them pay. There's nothing Gasol is doing here to prevent Embiid from making this shot:\nLooking back at the away trip to Memphis this year, I think there's a case to be made that Embiid simply had tired legs. The Sixers were on a back-to-back and woefully shorthanded after agreeing to the trade that brought Jimmy Butler in the day of the game, and Jaren Jackson Jr. gave Embiid plenty of problems when he tried to set up shop on the low block, too.\nThe game in Philly offered more insight, but there is context to consider there, too. Many of Embiid's misses came late in the shot clock in that game, and not on plays where he just dribbled out the clock by himself. The stats count the same, but it's not necessarily about a particular struggle with Gasol if Embiid misses a late-clock jumper after responsibility fell into his lap at the last second.\nThat said, there are times when those late-clock shots are a reflection of the battle with Gasol. The vet makes you work hard to establish position against him, ditto when you try to hold it. Gasol is a master of leaning into you enough to keep you off-balance without resorting to the pushing or tugging that leads to foul calls.\nFace Gasol up, and you run into a lot of the same problems. He has never been especially quick, but he doesn't necessarily need to be. He will sit back in a stance and establish his footing, preparing for the moment you make contact.\nYou can't go through him, and the Sixers will want to avoid a world where they have to rely on dragging him out, because that means Embiid needs to take and make a lot of threes. I'm more progressive on that front than many of you, but you want Embiid around the basket as much as possible. So what do you do?\nKeep Embiid moving\nThe simplest approach is to simply work around this. Much like the Ben Simmons vs. Kawhi Leonard issue, you're not going to solve this by trying to barrel through it. Luckily, the Sixers have already incorporated some of the plays they'll need to in order to navigate around Gasol.\nGetting the ball to Embiid on the move has been a struggle for the Sixers for years, and part of that is tied to how he wants to play. Embiid doesn't want to be relegated to a mere roll man on offense, nor should he. But his aversion to those sets cuts down your options.\nBut if Embiid takes the initiative to turn sagging off of him on the perimeter around on an opponent, he becomes dangerous. Late in the Brooklyn series, we saw him take the initiative as a cutter away from the ball, and nobody really wants to get in the way of Embiid if he comes through the lane with force.\nGranted, I would expect Gasol to be a little more attentive than Allen was on these plays, and Toronto's help defense is on another level than Brooklyn's if indeed Gasol screws up.\nThe Sixers have also done a better job of designing lobs for Embiid in recent months, a product of the time Embiid and Simmons have spent on the floor together the last couple months. Simmons' passing is high level, so he can hit the big man at the perfect time when he goes up to flush the ball.\nAs Brown pointed out, you might not be able to have JJ Redick just dump the ball into the post. But you can use the threat of Redick's shooting to help out Embiid. With the Nets top locking Redick to try to prevent him from reaching the perimeter, the Sixers had him run his own man into Embiid's guy, effectively screening two players at once to clear the lane.\nYou're not going to eliminate post-ups or face-up jumpers altogether for Embiid. But the Sixers will need to sprinkle in different looks to keep Gasol guessing, and to take some of the burden off of Embiid in a tough matchup.\nFollow Kyle on Twitter: @KyleNeubeck\nLike us on Facebook: PhillyVoice Sports"

Download The Action Network App to get real-time odds and live win probabilities on your bets.\nThe Knights (18-12-1 against the spread) have dropped their past two games ATS after covering in each of their previous eight contests. On the flip side, the Rams (20-11-1 ATS) failed to cover in three of their past five affairs.\nWhich team presents the most value in this Round of 64 matchup? Let\u2019s breakdown the biggest factors.\nHow Healthy is Marcus Evans?\nThe 6-foot-2 guard exited the Rams\u2019 Atlantic 10 tournament quarterfinals (knee injury) and failed to return. Evans isn\u2019t able to simulate game action in practice, but he\u2019s set to give it a go for their contest against the Knights.\nEvans has notched the 23rd-highest steal rate (4.1%) in the country, but it\u2019s unknown how much lateral movement he\u2019ll have at that end of the court.\nWill Tacko Fall 7 Co. Dominate Inside?\nThe Knights\u2019 59th-ranked Adjusted Offensive Efficiency (110.6 points per 100 possessions) stems from their prowess for attacking the rim.\nNot only has Johnny Dawkins\u2019 bunch produced the 79th-highest 2-point clip (52.5%) in college basketball \u2014 led by the 7-foot-6, 310-pound Tacko Fall (10.9 points per game) \u2014 but it has also generated the second-highest free-throw rate (46.4%) in the country.\nUCF point guard B.J. Taylor (16.0 ppg) initiates it all, along with tallying the 31st-highest individual rate in that department.\nVCU has struggled to stay out of foul trouble, especially in A-10 play, allowing the second-highest free-throw rate (37.6%). Overall, Mike Rhoades\u2019 squad has let up the 20th-highest scoring from that vicinity (20.9%).\nThe Rams still possess an advantage in the turnover department, though, even if Evans isn\u2019t as effective as usual. They\u2019ve manufactured the ninth-highest opponents\u2019 turnover rate (23.4%) while the Knight accrued the fifth-highest rate in AAC play. Expect Rhoades\u2019 ball pressure to give UCF issues, particularly when it looks to feed Fall in the low-post.\nCan VCU Succeed in Half-Court Sets?\nThe Rams\u2019 transition offense is electric when they turn their opponents over, utilizing the 40th-highest average possession length (16.1 seconds).\nBut their interior offense has been effective, too, totaling the 52nd-highest 2-point clip (53.7%) in the nation. The 6-foot-7 Marcus Santos-Silva (10.1 ppg) showcased his low-post prowess following Evans\u2019 departure on Friday, going off for a 26-point, 22-rebound performance.\nUCF\u2019s 2-point defense regressed in conference play, yielding the fourth-highest scoring rate (49.4%) to league foes. That\u2019s a product of its inability to control the glass, and VCU owns the 88th-highest offensive rebounding rate (31.1%) in the country.\nExpect the 6-foot-6 Isaac Vaas and the aforementioned Santos-Silva to have a major impact inside the arc, and anything Evans delivers off the dribble is a plus.\nEli\u2019s Pick: VCU +1, but don\u2019t bet it past VCU PK.\nOur Projected Odds: VCU vs. UCF\nGet point spreads for this game and every possible tournament matchup with our bracket simulator built by Sean Koerner, our Director of Predictive Analytics, a former oddsmaker and FantasyPros\u2019 most accurate in-season fantasy football ranker from 2015-2017.\nSpread: UCF -1\nUCF -1 Total: 125.5\n125.5 Proj Score: VCU 62.5 | UCF 63.5\nVCU 62.5 | UCF 63.5 Win Probability: VCU 49.8% | UCF 50.2%"

            "President Trump\u2019s longtime attorney Michael Cohen pointed a finger at his old boss Tuesday, saying he committed two campaign finance crimes at the direction of Trump when he arranged six-figure payoffs for women alleging affairs.\n\"His crime was the president's crime,\" Cohen attorney Lanny Davis, a Democrat who represented former President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, told Fox News Wednesday.\nBut many legal experts say Cohen didn't actually commit a campaign finance crime, leading to speculation about why he pleaded guilty, and what his confession may mean for Trump.\nThe criminal case against Cohen dealt largely with unrelated tax and bank fraud charges. The campaign finance charges were the only ones directly related to Trump, and in pleading guilty he accepted a contentious legal theory that payoffs to porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal were campaign contributions.\nAmong election law experts, however, there\u2019s doubt that Cohen committed a crime. Skeptics say silencing the women may have helped Trump during the 2016 campaign, but also protected Trump's family and company from embarrassment, meaning it wasn't an election contribution.\n[Also read: Trump's 'bad week': Manafort found guilty, Cohen enters plea deal]\nExperts point to the failed prosecution against former Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., whose wealthy supporters gave money to his mistress Rielle Hunter to silence her.\n\u201cThe big fish here is Trump, and this is a long way toward trying to \u2018get Trump,\u2019 so to speak,\u201d said Bradley Smith, a former Republican chairman of the Federal Election Commission.\nBut Smith, a professor at Capital University Law School who is \"not a big fan of Trump,\" said Cohen\u2019s plea doesn\u2019t necessarily torpedo the president, given the legal question is unsettled.\n\u201cI think it is not a crime to pay a mistress in this way, because it\u2019s not a campaign expense, even though it is something that potentially benefits the campaign,\u201d he said.\nSmith said campaign finance offenses are generally dealt with civil fines unless the offense is \u201cknowing and willful,\u201d a difficult standard when precedent is unsettled. \u201cKnowing and willful is what makes it criminal, absent the knowing and willful it\u2019s just a civil violation and you get a fine,\u201d he said.\nSmith said it\u2019s conceivable, however, that prosecutors would seek some tangential criminal charge against Trump pegged to Cohen\u2019s conduct, such as a fraud or conspiracy charge.\nOutside of court Tuesday, prosecutor Robert Khuzami, deputy U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said Cohen submitted \u201csham\u201d invoices for reimbursement after acting at Trump's direction to pay $130,000 to Daniels and to broker payment of $150,000 to McDougal by the Trump-allied National Enquirer\u2019s parent company.\nDavid Warrington, a Republican attorney who formerly worked with the Trump campaign, said he believes prosecutors may have sought Cohen\u2019s plea to the campaign finance counts to help special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\u201cSlapping on the campaign finance violation, maybe somebody in the prosecutors office thinks that helps them build a narrative in the Mueller investigation, even though this was done by the Southern District of New York,\u201d he said.\nWarrington said he could imagine a legal theory from Mueller's team relying on the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act of 2002, a corporate accountability law that he said has been wielded by prosecutors because of a broad prohibition on creating false records.\n\"I could see the Department of Justice coming up with a theory that allegedly false invoices would amount to a violation of Sarbanes-Oxley, in conjunction with the Federal Election Campaign Act alleged violation Cohen did,\" Warrington said. \"All of that is a stretch from a legal standpoint, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily stop the Department of Justice from investigating and charging someone under those theories.\"\nWarrington also believes that the alleged campaign finance crimes aren\u2019t actually crimes, and questions the legal guidance of Davis.\n\u201cLanny Davis had his client plead guilty to a crime that isn't a crime,\u201d Warrington said. \"Who\u2019s Lanny Davis really working for, Michael Cohen or the Clintons?\u201d\nTrump made the same argument Wednesday, tweeting, \"Michael Cohen plead guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime.\"\nWarrington said he believes that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the Southern District of New York, which prosecuted Cohen after a referral from Mueller\u2019s team, would not seek to unilaterally indict Trump, instead deferring to Mueller on the potentially unprecedented action.\nOther experts believe the Cohen plea implicating Trump may be intended primarily for political effect, potentially empowering an impeachment push among Democrats, should they regain control of Congress in the November election.\n\"The idea that this is a campaign contribution or expenditure is highly speculative,\" said attorney Cleta Mitchell, a Republican election law expert, saying that she believes Cohen's plea was not motivated by legal strategy, but by political motivations.\nHans von Spakovsky, a former member of the FEC who works at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that \"I believe the Justice Department would have a hard time prosecuting any such claim\" that payoffs were campaign expenses.\nDavis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nSmith, the former Republican FEC chairman who is not a Trump supporter, said he's concerned about prosecutors' actions.\n\u201cI find the whole thing kind of disturbing \u2013 what seems to be almost a determination to use whatever laws we can find to get Trump because a lot of people know Trump\u2019s such a bad guy, he must be violating the law, and even if he\u2019s not, we have to get him anyways,\" he said."

            "A preview of SeaWorld's new Sesame Street that will open to the public on Wednesday, March 27, 2019.\nThe magic of Sesame Street runs deep in SeaWorld Orlando\u2019s latest expansion, as the new land stays faithful to the television show but encompasses modern technology to get children to play.\nThe 18-month design and construction project will be complete Wednesday when the 6-acre land debuts to the public.\nAdvertisement\nThere are buttons to press, interactive screens to touch and Oscar the Grouch\u2019s garbage can to pound on \u2014 all part of a set designed to feel like the Muppets really live here.\nYoung guests take a spin on the Super Grover's Box Car Derby roller coaster at Sesame Street at SeaWorld Orlando, Tuesday, March 26, 2019. The new section of the park officially opens to guests on Wednesday. (Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) 3075270 (Joe Burbank / Orlando Sentinel)\nIt\u2019s possible to bump into other walk-around characters at SeaWorld\u2019s Sesame Street who \u201ccover the land heavily in the morning\u201d and then reappear in the afternoon for the parade \u2014 the first ever in the history of SeaWorld Orlando, said Amanda Trauger, creative development manager during a tour of the land.\nAdvertisement\nElmo, Bert, Ernie, Rosita and the Count pulled children from the crowd to dance amid the brightly decorated floats during a news media preview of the parade Tuesday. Even Big Bird moved surprisingly well in the hot sun with his large feet.\nBig Bird will be set up in his big nest, where one of his friends \u2013 that is, a human SeaWorld worker \u2013 will read stories to kids who gather around.\n\u201cThe nest is one of my favorite places,\u201d Trauger said. \u201cWhen that was in, it was like, \u2018This is Sesame Street.\u2019\u201d\nSeaWorld Orlando\u2019s grand opening comes during what is expected to be a blockbuster year in the theme park industry. The company, in the midst of a comeback that began in 2018, is competing for visitors as Universal Orlando debuts a new roller coaster from the beloved Harry Potter franchise on June 13 and Disney World opens its ambitious Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge on Aug. 29. Legoland Florida is also opening up its latest expansion based on The Lego Movie franchise Wednesday.\nThe new Sesame Street land, full of secret Easter Egg surprises, not only recreates the set of the television show in some places but also gave SeaWorld and Sesame Workshop room to make something new. It feels like a real urban neighborhood with two-story brick buildings where Elmo and other characters appear in the windows on high-definition screens.\nBig Bird and Elmo greets guests during the parade at the Sesame Street at SeaWorld Orlando preview, Tuesday, March 26, 2019. The parade is the first daily-scheduled parade in the park's history.

Evidence of the child-friendly environment is the queue with enough room for doublewide strollers as families wait in line for a photo opportunity with Elmo and Cookie Monster in a space dubbed the dressing rooms for the Muppets\u2019 theatrical productions. Displayed here are posters for \u201cLes Monsterables,\u201d \u201cBearspray\u201d and \u201cScramilton,\u201d starring Oscar the Grouch.\nAdvertisement\nOne of the many Easter Eggs at Sesame Street land.

Customers can buy big, monstrously blue cookies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sugar cookie on the outside, but the surprise is that on the inside is a whole chocolate-chip cookie,\u201d said Hector Colon, SeaWorld\u2019s executive chef. The snack is topped with white chocolate chips.\nColon is mixing it up on some of the traditional options, too.\n\u201cI\u2019m doing the old with a little bit of the new,\u201d he said, including tempura tenders and Hawaiian-style ones with pulled pork, barbecue sauce and bacon. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the kids, and it\u2019s good for the adults, too.\u201d\nBut parents and other adults must look for alcohol elsewhere in the park. No booze is sold on Sesame Street.\nAdvertisement\nIt's clear Cookie Monster is driving this food truck, a replica of a vehicle in the Sesame Street TV show.

Or use the wand at a mail delivery slot, and the Sesame Street\u2019s Yip Yips Martians appear under the flap to entertain on screen.\n\u201cIt takes the empowerment moment and gives it to a child,\u201d Trauger said.\nThe souvenirs are sold, naturally, from Mr. Hooper\u2019s Store, which has a prime location right on Sesame Street.\nOn television, viewers have only seen the front room, which at SeaWorld includes a portrait of the beloved Hooper, the store\u2019s first dollar, framed, and a toy cash register.

Now kids can board Super Grover\u2019s Box Car Derby roller coaster (previously Shamu Express), with cars that look like they\u2019re designed by the characters. Grover is in the lead car.\n\u201cThe idea is that the four other characters also created boxcars out of some of their favorite things. And then you jump on it and you go for a race,\u201d Trauger said.\nOther rides portray Big Bird in bird-watching mode, Slimy slithering around and Abby\u2019s Flower Tower, which spins and rises above the street scene.\nThe Sesame Street area has two new play areas, one dry and one wet that shoots out 500 gallons of water a minute. Kids will splash around at the colorful Rubber Duckie Water Works climb around Count-around Playground.\nWith little hoopla, Sesame Street at SeaWorld Orlando will be open during regular park hours Wednesday from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. No special events are expected to be held.\nAdvertisement\nGot a news tip? dbevil@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5477; Twitter: @ThemeParks and grusson@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5470; Twitter, @GabrielleRusson\nOscar The Grouch greets guests at Sesame Street at SeaWorld Orlando, Tuesday, March 26, 2019.

More info\nManchester United picked up their third win of the season with a workmanlike 2-1 victory over Watford. Romelu Lukaku opened the scoring at Vicarage Road with a bundled finish from Ashley Young\u2019s cross after 35 minutes. Chris Smalling then showed a delightful touch in the box to double the advantage, chesting and volleying past Ben Foster just three minutes later. Watford, who boasted four wins from four matches ahead of kick-off, hit back through Andre Gray in the second half but couldn\u2019t find a way back onto level terms and maintain their unbeaten record.\nExpress Sport has run the rule over the Manchester United players during their latest win, but do you agree with these ratings? Manchester United player ratings vs Watford \u2013 Premier League GK: David De Gea \u2013 6 One stunning save from Troy Deeney kept the scores level before United found the breakthrough. A late stop from Christian Kabasele was another demonstration of his worth to the team, although he will be disappointed to miss out on a clean sheet yet again. RB: Antonio Valencia \u2013 5 Still too slow with his decision making in the final third but always sticks to his guns defensively. CB: Chris Smalling \u2013 8 Has established himself as the first-choice centre-back at Old Trafford, displaying more leadership than has been seen in recent season. Then popped up at the other end with masterful control and a thumping finish to double United\u2019s lead. CB: Victor Lindelof \u2013 7 Very impressive range of passing and coped well with the physical presence of Deeney and Gray.\nWhich Manchester United players impressed most during their win over Watford?\nRomelu Lukaku opened the scoring with a bundled finish from Ashley Young's cross\nLB: Ashley Young \u2013 6 Given another chance to stake his claim with Luke Shaw sidelined and displayed an improved delivery. Provided the cross for Lukaku\u2019s goal, and generally kept Will Hughes quiet. CM: Paul Pogba \u2013 8 Involved in a private battle with Ben Foster, bringing the best out of the Hornets goalkeeper on two separate occasions in the first half. Looks at his best when striding forward in possession, and the team selection let him do that. CM: Marouane Fellaini \u2013 9 Preferred over Fred as United opted for greater physicality in midfield, and the Belgian ace didn\u2019t disappoint. Involved in both goals and looks one of Mourinho\u2019s more reliable players, despite still being unpopular among fans. Also provided an effective defensive shield and deserves to start again next week. CM: Nemanja Matic \u2013 5 With Fellaini in the holding role, Matic was undoubtedly neat and tidy but somewhat redundant. Similar to his time at Chelsea alongside N'Golo Kante, the Serbian needs to offer more offensively if he is going to justify his selection. Then demonstrated ill-discipline to pick up a second yellow in injury time.\nMarouane Fellaini was instrumental against both Watford and last time out against Burnley\nRAM: Jesse Lingard \u2013 6 One delightful cross to Pogba that should have been finished, and used his movement to open up space for others. LAM: Alexis Sanchez \u2013 4 Still working to recapture his best form, with the Chilean often looking frustrated at both his team-mates and himself for failing to meet his high standards. Worked Foster with a fierce drive but looks a shadow of his former self. ST \u2013 Romelu Lukaku \u2013 7 Benefited from Fellaini\u2019s selection and picked up the pieces after his team-mate caused carnage in the box, bundling home with his midriff. Now has four goals this season, despite not really setting the world alight with his performances.\nAlexis Sanchez had a frustrating afternoon at Vicarage Road\nSUB: Anthony Martial (on for Lingard, 70 mins) \u2013 4 Looked off the pace and made some poor decisions in possession as United came under pressure. SUB: Scott McTominay (on for Sanchez, 83 mins) \u2013 4 Brought on to add a physical presence in the closing stages, but also seemed sluggish at Watford threw the kitchen sink at United. SUB: Eric Bailly (on for Valencia, 91 mins) \u2013 N/A Jose Mourinho did his best to wind down the clock late on."

            "Just when we thought that the Bigg Boss Telugu house is unlike other language versions of the reality show, week 2 of the house changed all of that. From fights to tasks and emotions, the Telugu audience witnessed an extra dose of drama this week.\nWith his weekend gig, Nani took on his hosting responsibilities not only by announcing eliminations but also rightly picking out contestants who messed up during the week.\nAfter a dual elimination, week two's nominees were Ganesh, Kaushal, Nutan Naidu, Babu Gogenini and Deepthi Sunaina. And one must say, most bets were on either Nutan Naidu or Ganesh to exit the house and as predicted Nutan Naidu was announced as the second contestant to exit the Bigg Boss Telugu 2 house.\nWhile plenty of action unfolded in the house over the past few days, here's what got the audience most hooked:\nDirty Games\nThis week's luxury budget task involved performing in plenty of mud, which ultimately lead to heated up arguments between both the teams. As Geetha spearheaded this task, knowingly or unknowingly the singer gets dragged into most fights. While Kaushal particularly gets criticised for going against Geetha's decision time and again, Babu Gogineni has a moment of rage questioning Bigg Boss about the safety of the housemates. From Tanish's rage to Kaushal's lack of sportiness, it is all directed towards Geetha, evidently leaving her pissed and in an argument with Tanish. At the end of the dirty games between Nandini & Co vs Deepthi & Co, Deepthi and Nutan are once again sent to jail for losing.\nPunishment & war in the name of house rules\nThe weekly luxury budget task came to an end, with Deepthi and Nutan eventually coming out, but with lots of questions being raised about Kaushal. The fact that the actor had the jail card and did not want to use it for anyone, raised lots of eyebrows. But moving on, the main drama in the house starts only after this. Bigg Boss calls out Samrat, the captain of the week and lists out a slew of complaints. The contestants are pointed out for talking in English, sleeping and many other house rules that everyone seems to neglect. Samrat is made to take a dip in in the pool every time a housemate converses in English and the rest of them light up candles all night as punishment.\nTanish vs Kaushal\nWhile Samrat is still struggling to get the housemates to obey rules, this week's twist too takes places or rather begins with the captain himself. Samrat gets serious as he instructs the housemates to clean up their own dishes and keep bathrooms clean among other petty things. But Nutan finds Samrat's requests offensive and against family values, leading to a harsh argument.\nThings obviously heat up and hell breaks loose as Tanish and Kaushal involve themselves in support of Samrat and Nutan. The two are then at loggerheads for an entire episode, trying to make their point and arguing about figure of speech. Tanish accuses Kaushal of throwing a fit for no reason at the wrong time and Kaushal, on the other hand, is pissed with Tanish for being arrogant and supporting Samrat. The two also continue to fight regarding an incident that took place during the 'Chapandi Prabhu' task last week. Kaushal is accused of making Deepthi Sunaina feel uncomfortable, while Kaushal makes zero sense of this argument, as he feels it was done and dusted the moment he made peace with Sunaina. Or at least that's what everyone thinks, because little do they know that Sunaina wasn't actually done with that incident yet.\nAmit elected as captain of Week 3\nKaushal, Tanish and Amit stand up for the captaincy of week 3 and after a grueling task, Amit is announced as the winner. But yet again, the drama continues with Kaushal at loggerheads with Keeriti this time around. Keeriti is seen playing duplictious games and instigating Kaushal for no apparent reason. Keeriti kicks off Kaushal's rage once again by trying to turn the women of the house against him. And while Amit is made the new captain, arguments about Keeriti's mind games continue to take place.\nNani points fingers at Tanish and Deepthi Sunaina\nAfter an intense week of arguments, threats and what not, it was time for Nani to take over. With his weekend stint, while he made the housemates laugh with plenty of fun tasks and entertained the audience with witty remarks, he also makes a point or two. Nani goes on to talk about the impact the Bigg Boss contestants have on Telugu audience and how even a slight change in behavior can affect their votes. He emphasises on Kaushal's concern at being cornered and how his honest fight turned around the game for him.\nWhile that was the case for Kaushal, Tanish and Deepthi Sunaina definitely seem to be in Nani's bad books for the time being. As Sunaina was pulled up for not standing for herself, bitching and constantly being treated as a kid, Tanish's anger management was addressed too. The two seemed to be in deep trouble for their attitude and are chastised by Nani.\nApart from one-on-one tiffs, Nani also throws light on group-ism keeping in mind Tejaswi, Samrat and Tanish in particular and how this is alienating other contestants. The star host goes on to warn housemates about favourable behavior and audience reaction to the same.\nA lot of new controversies with existing bonds are now brewing in the house, post the eviction of Sanjana and now Nutan, both of whom were season two's first jail inmates and the most controversial ones too. Meanwhile, as Amit promises to bring back the house together, Nani wraps up week two stating how anything can change anytime in the Bigg Boss house. So, with new enemies and recent shift in the atmosphere, looks like the reality show is definitely gearing up for a killer and rather dramatic week three."

            "There's an old adage about running for office: when a person runs, their whole family runs along with them. And yet, in an era where the private is increasingly public, John McCain managed to keep his family life largely out of the spotlight.\nThough his own actions were very much in the public sphere, the late Senator, who passed away on Saturday after a prolonged battle with brain cancer, eschewed calling attention to his family or sharing tidbits of their personal lives. It was a particularly impressive feat, considering that his brood included seven children born across four decades.\n\u201cIt\u2019s intentional,\u201d McCain once said, when questioned about the conspicuous absence of his family during his 2008 presidential campaign. \u201cI just feel it\u2019s inappropriate for us to mention our children. ... I\u2019d like them to have their own lives. I wouldn\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m trying to gain some kind of advantage. I just feel that it\u2019s a private thing.\u201d\nMore From Town & Country\nCindy McCain stands with Meghan, Andy, Jimmy, Jack, Doug, Bridget, and Sidney McCain during the Republican National Convention on September 4, 2008 Alex Wong // Getty Images\nWith the exceptions of Cindy McCain, who stood by her husband's side throughout his political career and during his recent battle with cancer, and their daughter Meghan, who has made a name for herself as a political and pop-culture commentator, the other members of the McCain family have mostly opted for low-profile lifestyles that have garnered little public attention. And yet, from their places in the background, each member of the McCain family helped to shape the Senator into the man who became a major public figure and worked at the heart of the American political scene.\nRelated Story Roberta McCain at 100 and in Command\nCarol McCain\nJohn McCain married his first wife, Carol, in 1965. She was, at the time, a single mother of two boys and would within their first year of marriage give birth to a daughter as well. Their life as a young family was cut short in 1967 when McCain, a Navy pilot, was shot down over Vietnam and held there as a prisoner of war. Carol took on the job of raising her three children on her own, finally welcoming McCain home when he was released in 1973.\nHowever, the years and traumas had taken a toll on their marriage. \u201cAs dad progressed, he was gone a lot, doing a lot of international travel, and it was putting a little stress on the marriage,\u201d their son Andy recalled in the documentary John McCain: For Whom the Bell Tolls. In 1979, McCain met Cindy, who would become his second wife a scant six weeks after his divorce from Carol was finalized. \"I was pretty much blindsided and it broke my heart,\u201d Carol said in the documentary.\nDespite the rocky end to their marriage, though, Carol and McCain maintained a warm relationship in the ensuing decades. \u201cA lot of people tried to get me to say bad things about him during [the 2008 presidential campaign,\" she stated. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Are you crazy? I would never do that, you don\u2019t know me or you wouldn\u2019t ask me. ... I mean, I love the man. I would never do anything to harm him in any way.\u201d\nCindy McCain\nJohn and Cindy McCain at the family\u2019s Arizona ranch in March 2000. David Hume Kennerly // Getty Images\nThe courtship between McCain and his second wife was brief. At the time, she was working a special education teacher in Arizona and happened be invited to a reception that McCain was attending. \"He introduced himself to me and I just didn\u2019t know what to expect,\" Cindy stated in the documentary. \"What I saw was this incredible human being that was a lot of fun to be around.\u201d\nWithin a year of meeting, the 43 year old McCain would propose 25 year old Cindy. \u201cI really didn\u2019t think he\u2019d propose,\u201d Cindy said. \u201cHe was older. I knew he cared very deeply for me. I did know that.\u201d\nThe couple wed in 1980, and over the course of their 38 year marriage would go on to have four children, run multiple political campaigns including two bids for the presidency, and work side by side in efforts both political and humanitarian.\nThis content is imported from twitter.

I am so lucky to have lived the adventure of loving this incredible man for 38 years,\" Cindy wrote on Twitter in response to McCain's passing on August 25. \"He passed the way he lived, on his own terms, surrounded by the people he loved, in the place he loved best.\"\nDoug McCain\nThe eldest of McCain's children, Doug, 58, was the first of Carol McCain's two sons from her first marriage. After wedding Carol, McCain quickly adopted Doug and his younger brother, Andy. Though McCain was shot down over Vietnam in 1967 and held there as a prisoner of war until 1973, it's obvious that his service made a serious impression on his oldest son. Like his father, Doug would go on to become a pilot in the Navy and now serves as a captain for American Airlines, a company that shared a moving tribute to the late Senator.\n\"Senator McCain will be sorely missed but his impact lives on. We will not forget his shining example of patriotism based on the ideals of freedom and equality for all and global leadership by the United States in support of those ideals,\" the airline said in a statement, offering condolences to the McCain family and Doug in particular.\nAndrew McCain\nThe youngest of Carol's sons, 56-year-old Andy also chose to follow a path deeply intwined with his adopted father's life, though in a distinctly different way from his brother's.\nLike all three children from McCain's first marriage, Andy had a strained start with his stepmother Cindy (neither Doug, Andy, nor Sidney reportedly attended the couple's 1980 wedding ceremony), but the two evidently developed close ties over the years. After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and MBA from Vanderbilt, Andy started working for Hensley Beverage Company, a beverage distributorship in association with Anheuser-Busch. The company was founded in 1955 by Cindy's father, Jim Hensely; Andy has served as an executive there for many years.\nJohn and Cindy McCain pose with Andy, Jimmy, Jack, Bridget, Meghan, Doug, and Sidney McCain in February 2000 in New Hampshire. David Hume Kennerly // Getty Images\nSidney McCain\nBorn just a year before her father's plane was shot down over Vietnam, Sidney, 51, was just 9 months old when her father was captured. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have a father to miss because I didn\u2019t know what a father was,\u201d she told the New York Times of the five and a half years of her childhood during McCain's absence. Upon his return, she said, \u201cI remember my dad just squeezing me and not wanting to let me go. It was very overwhelming at the time.\u201d\nA music executive and longtime registered Democrat, Sidney was reportedly the most politically disparate from her father, but that didn't stop the two from maintaining a close connection. \u201cI was the boundary pusher,\u201d Sidney said in that 2007 interview. \u201cIn high school I was very rebellious. I needed to look at all sides. At least he would hear me out.\u201d\nMeghan McCain\nSenator John McCain visited \u2019The View\u2019 for daughter Meghan McCain\u2019s birthday in October 2017. Heidi Gutman // Getty Images\nMeghan McCain was the Senator's first child with his second wife Cindy. Meghan, 33, has developed a following in her own right since she first began garnering attention for her work on her father's 2008 presidential campaign, and for posting about her experiences on the road on the now-defunct McCainBlogette.com. The Columbia grad went on to become a commentator on Fox News and currently serves as a co-host on The View.\nWhile she has remained a stalwart champion of her father's political career in the decade since and operated as the family's spokesperson in the latter days of the Senator's life, she remembered him first and foremost as a loving father.\nThis content is imported from twitter.

All that I am is thanks to him. Now that he is gone, the task of my lifetime is to live up to his example, his expectations and his love.\"\nAt his memorial service at the Washington National Cathedral on Saturday, Meghan gave a moving tribute to her father, who she remember both for his strength in guiding the nation as well as his dedication to his family.\n\"An ancient Greek historian wrote The image of great men is woven into the stuff of other men's lives. Dad, your greatness is woven into my life, it is woven into my mother's life, into my sister's life, and it is woven into my brothers' lives. It is woven into the life and liberty of the country you sacrificed so much to defend,\" she said.

MANDEL NGAN // Getty Images\nNamed after his father, John Sidney McCain IV, aged 32, is better known to his family as Jack. McCain's third son was so dedicated to following his father's example that the Naval Academy was the only school he applied to when he graduated high school. \u201cI want to be a part of our family legacy,\u201d he reportedly said. The decision ultimately paid off, with Jack carrying on the family's aviation tradition by becoming a MH-60 Seahawk helicopter pilot.\nIn 2013, he married Renee Swift McCain, a former Air Force Reserve captain.\n\"It is not the man that was great, but instead it was his desire to serve a cause greater than himself that defined his life. To me, he was a giant, but to him he was an imperfect servant of the nation he loved deeply,\" Jack wrote on Twitter following his father's death. \"Fair winds, following seas, and clear skies.\"\nJames \"Jimmy\" McCain\nThe youngest of the McCain boys, Jimmy, 30, also followed in his father's footsteps by enlisting for military service. Rather than training as a pilot, though, Jimmy chose to serve as a Marine, including a tour in Iraq when he was 19. It was in this, perhaps, that McCain most prominently showed his dedication to not using his family for political points, refusing to mention his son's active service even when questioned about the military situation in Iraq at the time.\nAt McCain's funeral, Jimmy read out McCain's favorite poem, Requiem by Robert Louis Stevenson. McCain reportedly read the same selection at his own father's funeral.\nBridget McCain\nCindy and Bridget McCain hold hands at the 2008 Republican National Convention. Scott Olson // Getty Images\nThe last of McCain's children, 27-year-old Bridget came into the McCain family through Cindy's humanitarian work. While visiting an orphanage in Bangladesh in 1991, Cindy came across baby Bridget who suffered from a severe cleft palette as well as a congenital heart condition. Cindy obtained visas and managed to bring the baby back to the US for medical treatment\u2014all without informing her husband. The first McCain learned of it, according to former McCain aide Wes Gullett was when Cindy and Bridget got off the plane from Bangladesh. \"He asked: 'Where is she going?'\" Gullett explained, introducing Bridget at the 2008 Republican National Convention.\"To which [Cindy] replied: 'To our house.'\"\n\"[Overseas adoptions] were very odd, rare things then, but Cindy never said anything more than, \u2018We have this baby now,'\" a family friend told People. \"Just \u2018This is my daughter, she\u2019s from Bangladesh, I couldn\u2019t leave without her.'\"\nOn Thursday August 30th, Bridget read a bible verse at the memorial service for her father at North Phoenix Baptist Church.\nRelated Story 10 Inspiring Quotes From John McCain\nRelated Story John McCain's Memorial Service in Photos"

            "Nevertheless, she insisted.\nWhile most fellow 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls ducked and dived to find safe ground \u2014 and party elders solemnly warned against over-reach \u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren stepped boldly out into the open late Friday and called on the House to begin an impeachment process against President Donald Trump based on special counsel Robert Mueller's report.\nThe Massachusetts senator and 2020 Democratic presidential contender slammed Trump for having \"welcomed\" the help of a \"hostile\" foreign government and having obstructed the probe into an attack on an American election.\n\"To ignore a President's repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country,\" Warren tweeted. \"The severity of this misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty. That means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the President of the United States.\"\nIt was a rare moment in a crowded and unsettled primary: A seized opportunity for a candidate to cut through the campaign trail cacophony and define the terms of a debate that will rage throughout the contest.\nWith her party torn between its impulses \u2014 to avoid the potential political death spiral of a failed impeachment even though it may be popular with the energized base and to hold Trump accountable for what Democrats see as gross abuses \u2014 Warren framed pursuing House hearings as a matter of conscience.\nIn other words, she sided with that base of core party supporters, defined its cause in moral terms and hollered the message from the mountaintop.\nThat's classic Warren. And in a period when she's focused her campaign on serious policy proposals, it is a timely reminder to progressives that they like her politics, too.\nDownload the NBC News app for breaking news and politics\n\"Not doubting her sincerity here but it's also probably a very shrewd primary move to leap out front on this,\" tweeted David Axelrod, who served as a top campaign and White House adviser to President Barack Obama.\nA campaign official told NBC News Warren believed it was the right course of action after reading Mueller's report during a flight home from the campaign trail Thursday. Nevertheless, she will remain focused on her policy platform, not impeachment, the official said.\nAnd yet, calling for the removal of a president \u2014 especially when so many other Democrats are reluctant to do so (shortly before Warren issued her statement, fellow senator and 2020 hopeful Amy Klobuchar said, \"I think you've seen all the senators are very cautious about talking about this because we would be the jury if there was any kind of an action brought over from the House\") \u2014 isn't a particularly forgettable act.\nAdam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren, said the political left is outraged over the handling of the Mueller report by Attorney General William Barr and the response by the White House.\nWarren's move could help her capitalize on that energy at a time when several of her rivals have been garnering more attention \u2014 as well as bigger fundraising hauls and higher poll numbers \u2014 in the early months of the primary campaign.\n\"If you think about the oxygen that is now in the room for the entire Russia-Mueller-impeachment swirl of stuff, for weeks or months, every time someone comes out publicly and agrees that we need to begin impeachment hearings, people will remember that Elizabeth Warren is the presidential candidate that got that started,\" Green said.\nWhile Green noted Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., introduced the House resolution that would be a likely vehicle for beginning impeachment hearings, Warren's status as a significant player in the primary will likely make her announcement a major marker if the House moves forward against the president.\nAt nearly the same time as Warren spoke out, fellow progressive Bernie Sanders, the polling leader among candidates currently in the race, waved off press questions about the Mueller report in South Carolina.\nOn Thursday, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, who said during his Senate campaign last year against Ted Cruz that he would vote to impeach Trump, framed the question as one for Congress or the voters \u2014 rather than presidential candidates.\nAsked about impeachment proceedings, O'Rourke says: \"I'm gonna leave that to those members of the House who as they review those findings can make that decision. ... But ultimately at this point I believe that this is going to be decided in November 2020.\" https://t.co/kAEhVFeYdP \u2014 Patrick Svitek (@PatrickSvitek) April 18, 2019\nMayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, said he was \"pretty sure\" Trump \"deserves to be impeached\" but deferred to Congress, while former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, speaking before Warren, said it would be \"perfectly reasonable\" for lawmakers to launch impeachment proceedings. \"This president should be held accountable,\" Castro said on MSNBC.\nSen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said on MSNBC's \"All In with Chris Hayes\" on Thursday that she wants to hear what Mueller has to say about his report before passing judgment on whether impeachment proceedings should begin \u2014 similar to the position of her fellow Californian, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, perhaps the most important player in any impeachment drama.\nThe reticence of some Warren's rivals suggests her decision to walk point on the left flank of the impeachment front carries some risk, even if it's a quick path to rally support from liberals.\nIt will not only put her squarely back in Trump's field of vision, but it also will expose her to friendly political fire from Democrats who believe pursuing his ouster is the surest way to ensure his re-election.\nStill, Warren, often cited as the heir to Edward M. Kennedy as the liberal lion of the Senate, has shown that her brand can be most compelling when a healthy dose of politics is mixed in with her substance.\nThat's what happened when GOP senators cited the chamber's rules to take away Warren's speaking privileges during a 2017 debate over Trump's nomination of Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. Warren had read from a letter criticizing Sessions that had been written by Coretta Scott King in 1986.\nSince Sessions was a member of the Senate at the time of the nomination fight, Warren was told she couldn't malign him under the rules. The Senate voted to prevent her from speaking again on Sessions' nomination.\n\"She was warned. She was given an explanation,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said afterward. \"Nevertheless, she persisted.\"\nProgressives quickly adopted McConnell's disparaging phrase as a symbol for strong women. It was even condensed to \"She Persisted\" for the title of a bestselling book by Chelsea Clinton.\nIt remains to be seen whether Warren's impeachment call will give her a major boost. But there aren't many opportunities to stand out from the crowd, and she took this one without hesitation."

            "Many Indonesians have taken to social media to express their disappointment at what they say was a lacklustre presidential debate kicking off the race to lead the island nation of 250 million people.\nKey points: The first round of the Indonesia's presidential debate focused on law, human rights, terrorism, and corruption.\nThe first round of the Indonesia's presidential debate focused on law, human rights, terrorism, and corruption. Critics said the debate was less interesting because the candidates looked like they had memorised it\nCritics said the debate was less interesting because the candidates looked like they had memorised it There will be four more round debates before the election taken place in April 2019\nIndonesian netizens were tweeting with anticipation on Thursday night in the lead-up to the first debate ahead of April elections, sending hashtag #DebatePilpres2019 to the top of Twitter's world trends list.\nBut as the debate between President Joko Widodo and Opposition Leader Prabowo Subianto kicked off, the mood seemed to change as many criticised both men for parroting speeches rather than devising punchy rebuttals.\nOne social media user even compared it to a high school debate.\n\"This is a debate, not a memorising competition. They respond once to their opponent and they are done. High school students are even better than this and they do it in English,\" he posted on Twitter.\nWhen the leaders were questioned about their plans to prevent terrorism and radicalisation, Mr Subianto responded by blaming the issues on \"infiltration from overseas\" and local injustice.\n\"I will support the deradicalisation program, I will invest heavily in pesantren [Islamic schools], teachers, and our people by improving their quality of life \u2014 they won't feel despair and hate the country,\" he said.\nAfter a similar answer from the opposing side, program commentators said the discussion between two candidates \"wasn't dynamic\", as neither side was preparing follow-up questions to attack their opponent.\n\"That's probably because they were not mastering the terrorism issues in Indonesia,\" a commentator said.\nMr Widodo (left) told his opponent \"don't just accuse me, give evidence\". ( AP: Tatan Syuflana )\nLeaders facing off in election for second time\nAs has become the norm in Indonesian political campaigns, the leaders wore outfits matching those of their running mates, with Mr Subianto and vice presidential candidate Sandiaga Uno arriving early to the venue in blue suits and maroon ties.\nMr Widodo and his running mate \u2014 wearing matching white shirts \u2014 arrived late due to one of Jakarta's notorious traffic jams.\nPresident Widodo, known widely as Jokowi, is running for a second term against Mr Subianto, a former general who many accuse of a history of human rights abuses.\nThis is the second time the two men have faced off in an election.\nIn 2014, Mr Widodo narrowly beat Mr Subianto, gaining 53 per cent of the vote.\nBut after the election, many supporters of Mr Subianto questioned whether Mr Widodo was \"Islamic enough\" to lead the majority Muslim nation.\nThis year, Mr Widodo chose as his running mate 75-year-old Ma'ruf Amin, head of the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), Indonesia's top Muslim clerical body.\nIn contrast Mr Uno, the former deputy governor of Jakarta, is an avid marathon runner who is often portrayed in the local media as a millennial magnet.\nAmnesty International Indonesia said it appreciated Mr Subianto (left) recognised the importance of human rights. ( AP: Tatan Syuflana )\nReligious matters appeared to be of particular interest to social media users, with a frenzy of posts pertaining to the pre-debate prayers of both candidates.\nMr Widodo's supporters tweeted that he prayed in the mosque with Mr Amin before the debate.\nOthers responded saying Mr Subianto and Mr Uno also prayed together and they have asked for blessings from Islamic scholars.\nLocal media reported both sides rehearsed for the debate, although they denied it.\nReports also claimed they both hired communications and political campaign experts to familiarise them with the talking points that were provided in advance by Indonesia's General Elections Commission (KPU).\nThe focus of the questions was law, human rights, terrorism, and corruption, but experts blamed the advance questions for a lack of energy shown by the speakers.\n\"This is what happened if the questions are already given to the candidates,\" Feri Amsari, the director of Centre Studies of Constitution at Indonesia's Universitas Andalas, said.\n\"The debate became less interesting because the candidates look like they memorised it,\" he said on a local TV station during the debate.\nPraise among criticism\nDuring his introductory speech, Mr Widodo expressed his vision for Indonesia, reading what seemed to be a pre-prepared text.\nMr Prabowo's opening remarks were more confident. Speaking without notes, he explained his vision for Indonesia and also gave the floor to his running mate to speak.\nBut his speech was criticised for repeating the key messages on his campaign materials.\nDespite the negative reviews, Mr Widodo was praised for being more courageous in his rebuttals.\nSeveral times Mr Widodo responded to his opponent saying, \"don't just accuse, give evidence, and lodge an official report\".\nBut many Indonesians were left disappointed when both candidates failed to fully address key issues such as military involvement in combatting terrorism, the controversial ITE law, and the status of the Corruption Eradication Commission.\nThere has been some speculation the two candidates agreed to stay away from controversial human rights issues.\nHowever, Usman Hamid from Amnesty International Indonesia said the efforts of the two candidates need to be appreciated.\nThere is speculation the two presidential candidates agreed to stay away from controversial human rights issues. ( AP: Tatan Syuflana )\n\"Mr Widodo has committed to putting greater value on human rights and Mr Subianto also marked the importance of it,\" Mr Hamid told Kompas TV.\nHe also said both candidates committed to respecting human rights when combatting terrorism and deradicalisation, although they did not give specific answers regarding this nor did they prioritise it during the debate.\nDuring the final segment, the debate moderators asked the candidates to give final two-minute statements in appreciation of their opponent, but both refused the offer.\nFour more rounds of debates are scheduled in the lead-up to the April election.\nThe second, to be held next month, will focus on energy, food, natural resources, environment, and infrastructure.\nThe fourth debate, scheduled in March, will cover ideology, governance, security, and international relationships.\nIt remains to be seen if Indonesia's relationship with Australia will be mentioned by the candidates."

            "Bank of England raises UK interest rates Published 2 August 2018\nImage source, Reuters\nThe Bank of England has raised the interest rate for only the second time in a decade.\nThe rate has risen by a quarter of a percentage point, from 0.5% to 0.75% - the highest level since March 2009.\nWhile the decision means that the 3.5 million people with variable or tracker mortgages will pay more, the rise will be welcomed by savers.\nMark Carney, the Bank's governor, said there would be further \"gradual\" and \"limited\" rate rises to come.\nSome business groups questioned the decision to raise the rate now ahead of the UK agreeing a Brexit deal with the European Union.\nHowever, Mr Carney told the BBC that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) would cut rates if needed.\n\"There are a variety of scenarios that can happen with Brexit \u2026 but in many of those scenarios interest rates should be at least at these levels and so this decision is consistent with that,\" he said.\n\"In those scenarios where the interest rate should be lower, well then the MPC which meets eight times a year would, I'm confident, take the right decision to adjust interest rates at that time.\"\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Media caption, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney\nSuren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"While a quarter-point rise may have a limited long-term financial impact on most businesses, it risks undermining confidence at a time of significant political and economic uncertainty.\"\nWhy are they doing this now?\nThe Bank's MPC had been expected to raise interest rates in May, but held fire because the economy went through a weak patch at the start of the year - partly because of the harsh weather conditions, dubbed the Beast from the East.\nThe Bank is now confident that the dip was temporary and that economic growth will recover from the 0.2% rate seen in the first quarter, to 0.4% in the second quarter and maintain that pace later in the year.\nImage source, Getty Images Image caption, Homeowners with a variable rate or tracker mortgage will face an increase in payments\nThe Bank is sticking to previous guidance that there will be further interest rate rises, but Mr Carney said these will be \"limited and gradual\".\n\"Rates can be expected to rise gradually. Policy needs to walk, not run, to stand still,\" he said.\nHowever, the Institute of Directors said the Bank had \"jumped the gun\" by raising the rate now.\nIt said: \"The rise threatens to dampen consumer and business confidence at an already fragile time.\n\"Growth has remained subdued, and the recent partial rebound is the least that could be expected after the lack of progress in the year's first quarter.\"\nFive interest rate facts\nMore than 3.5 million residential mortgages are on a variable or tracker rate\nThe average standard variable rate mortgage is 4.72%\nOn a \u00a3150,000 variable mortgage, a rise to 0.75% is likely to increase the annual cost by \u00a3224\nA Bank rate rise does not guarantee the equivalent increase in interest paid to savers. Half did not move after the last rate rise\nNo easy access savings account at a major High Street bank pays interest of more than 0.5%\nThe Bank said a pick-up in the economy is being supported by household spending, which the Bank said had been \"erratic\" earlier in the year.\nIt is also believes the recent series of store closures on the High Street does not reflect a lack of appetite for shopping.\nIn its Quarterly Inflation Report, the Bank said: \"Although in the past year the number of retail closures have increased and retail footfall has fallen, contacts of the Bank's agents suggest that mainly reflects shifts in consumer demand to online stores and from goods to services.\"\nThis video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Media caption, Homeowner Sarah Cottingham: \"All my spare money goes on my mortgage now\"\nCommenting on Brexit, Mr Carney said the Monetary Policy Committee \"recognises that the economic outlook could be influenced significantly by the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal\".\nHe said: \"Negotiations are now entering a critical period, with the UK and EU both seeking an agreement by the end of the year.\n\"Although the range of potential outcomes is wide, what matters for monetary policy is how people react to developments.\"\nHe said British households so far have been \"resilient - but not indifferent - to Brexit news\".\nWhat is the outlook?\nThe Bank sees continuing \"modest\" economic growth of 1.4% this year and an increase to 1.8% next year.\nThe unemployment rate is expected to fall further from 4.2% and wage growth is expected to pick up.\nInflation is forecast to fall back to 2% - the Bank of England's target - by 2020.\nThe Bank sees some clouds on the economic horizon.\nImage source, Getty Images Image caption, The Bank of England said a trade row between the US and China was weighing on the global economic outlook\nIt said the outlook for the global economy was a bit gloomier, partly owing to the trade war between the US and China which has seen tariffs imposed on a range of goods.\nIt also highlighted a slowdown in the UK housing market this year, which has been \"concentrated in London\", where mortgage completions are down 12% on 2016.\nBut the Bank thinks that weakness might just be specific to the capital and may not say much about the prospects for the UK housing market as a whole.\nWhat happens next?\nThe Bank is sticking to its guidance that interest rates will continue to head higher, but only at gradual pace and to a limited extent.\nThe financial markets have taken this on board and are forecasting one, and perhaps two, rises of 0.25% before 2020.\nIt also seems unlikely the UK will return to interest rates of 5% and above.\nIn its inflation report, the Bank said that an ageing population would hold relatively more assets, while lower productivity means reduced demand for capital from businesses.\nCombined, those two trends would lower the interest rate needed to stop the economy from overheating."

            "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain took part in outdoor training with Dejan Lovren and Ben Woodburn on Monday, as Liverpool\u2019s warm-weather camp in Dubai begins.\nThe Reds left Merseyside after Saturday\u2019s 4-3 win over Crystal Palace, with a lengthy break before the arrival of Leicester on January 30 providing an opportunity to get away.\nJurgen Klopp has taken his squad to Dubai, as with this time last year, and insisted at the weekend that \u201cit will not be a real break, we have to use it for training.\u201d\nWhile the majority of his players had two days to rest, Oxlade-Chamberlain took to the pitches at Nad Al Sheba Sports Complex to continue his recovery from a long-term knee injury.\nHe was joined by short-term absentees Lovren (hamstring) and Woodburn (ankle) as head of fitness and conditioning Andreas Kornmayer put them through their paces in the UAE sun:\nOxlade-Chamberlain can be seen working on his close control, passing and heading, and as Klopp enthused in a recent press conference, looks to be moving freely despite the severity of the injury picked up back in April.\n\u201cWhen I see him running, or when I see him moving with the ball and all that stuff, what he\u2019s doing already, that looks really good,\u201d the manager explained.\n\u201cPromising, close to a return. But he\u2019s so long out\u2014April, what a situation against Rome.\n\u201cBut it will be fine. It looks completely without any problems in the moment, no swellings anymore, stuff like that.\n\u201cSo he can really work already on his fitness issues, which he obviously has after a long time.\u201d\nPatience is still required with the 25-year-old, but Klopp added that he \u201cthinks we will see him this season,\u201d which is hugely encouraging.\nThe return of Lovren will be a boost ahead of the end-of-the-month clash with Leicester, as defensive options Joe Gomez, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Fabinho and Ki-Jana Hoever are all currently sidelined.\nAnd with Woodburn working his way back to full fitness, he is likely to depart on another loan spell this month following the early termination of his deal with Sheffield United.\nIt is unclear as of yet which other players have travelled to Dubai, but This Is Anfield will bring full updates when possible."

As per preliminary information, the family was on the way back from Thrissur where they had gone to visit a temple.\nWhile Balabhaskar and his wife, Lakshmi have been rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment, their 2-year-old daughter, Tejasvini, unfortunately could not be saved.\n\u201cWe assume that the driver dozed off, which caused the accident. The family was returning from Thrissur after visiting a temple,\u201d Mangalapuram police told TNM.\nThe violinist and his family were travelling in the vehicle on Tuesday morning when it hit a tree. The police are currently speculating that the driver may have dozed off while driving, which may have caused him to crash into the tree. A highway patrol unit rushed the family to a nearby hospital immediately, however, the child could not be saved. Her body has been kept at the hospital.\nBalabhaskar and Lakshmi are reported to be in a critical condition at present and are receiving treatment from doctors.\nHis driver, Arjun, too was injured in the accident and has also been admitted to the hospital.\nThe singer is a quite well-known musician and is popular for his stage performances. He began his music career at the young age of 12 and was the youngest music composer to have worked in the Malayalam film industry, with the soundtrack for the movie Mangalya Pallak.

The teen had autism and had previously suffered from seizures.\n\"To my sweet love, Jett... you are in our hearts forever,\" Kelly wrote alongside a black-and-white photo of her and John kissing Jett on a bed. \"I send love to all of the beautiful autistic children and the wonderful people who love them. May we all shine and grant love and respect to children with special needs? #autismawareness #autism\"\nThe sweet post came during Autism Awareness Month and just ahead of Jett's 27th birthday. John, 65, commented on his wife's post with a heart emoji.\nKelly and John also share Ella, 19, and Benjamin, 8. Back in 2016, John opened up to Good Morning America about how welcoming Benjamin five years after Jett's death helped their family come together.\n\"We certainly have bonded together,\" he said at the time. \"And certainly, having little Ben has been a beautiful kind of glue for us to rebond after tremendous loss.\"\nWatch the video below for more on Kelly and John's family:\nGET THE ET NEWSLETTER Email By signing up, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy\nRELATED CONTENT:\nEXCLUSIVE: John Travolta Thanks Late Son Jett After 'People v.

            "A second woman came forward Sunday to accuse Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of a decades-old sexual assault, the same day his first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, committed to testifying about her own allegations before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.\nHere's what we know about Kavanaugh's second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, and her allegations:\nWhat Ramirez alleges\nRamirez alleged in an article in The New Yorker magazine that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party when they were both freshmen at Yale University.\nAccording to Ramirez, she and Kavanaugh were among a small group of students playing a drinking game in a dorm room in the university's Lawrence Hall when the alleged incident occurred.\nRamirez said the game quickly led to her intoxication. She recalls being on the floor and slurring her words when she alleges a male student exposed himself and shoved his penis in her face. She said she pushed the man away, touching him in the process.\nShe alleged she remembered Kavanaugh pulling up his pants and laughing.\nRamirez told The New Yorker the incident left her \"embarrassed and ashamed and humiliated.\"\nMore:Second woman accuses Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault in New Yorker report\nHazy memories\nRamirez told The New Yorker that she was initially reluctant to come forward because she was intoxicated when the alleged incident occurred and \"her memories contained gaps.\"\nThe New Yorker report said that at first she \"was reluctant to characterize Kavanaugh\u2019s role in the alleged incident with certainty. After six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney, Ramirez said that she felt confident enough\" to come forward.\nThe New Yorker said it was unable to identify any other witnesses who remember Kavanaugh attending the dorm-room party in question.\nMore:Democrats ask Kavanaugh to withdraw as Republicans cast doubt on second assault allegation\nWho is Deborah Ramirez?\nRamirez, 53, was raised a \"devout Catholic\" in Connecticut, according to The New Yorker. She currently lives in Boulder, Colorado.\nRamirez studied sociology and psychology at Yale, where she graduated in 1987, along with Kavanaugh. NBC News reports that she is a board member and volunteer at Safehouse Progressive Alliance for Nonviolence, an organization that helps victims of domestic violence.\nShe is a registered Democrat but denied that her allegation was politically motivated, The New Yorker reported.\nRamirez's attorney Stanley Garnett told The New Yorker that she is \"as careful and credible a witness as I\u2019ve encountered in 36 years of practicing law.\"\nKavanaugh denies the allegation\nIn response to the New Yorker story, the White House released a statement from Kavanaugh who said the incident alleged by Ramirez \"did not happen\" and called the allegation \"a smear, plain and simple.\"\n\"This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen,\" Kavanaugh said. \"The people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so. This is a smear, plain and simple. I look forward to testifying on Thursday about the truth, and defending my good name \u2013 and the reputation for character and integrity I have spent a lifetime building \u2013 against these last-minute allegations.\"\nOn Monday, Kavanaugh sent a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and the Judiciary Committee's ranking Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., in which he said Ramirez had made \"a false and uncorroborated accusation.\" He denounced a \"frenzy\" to block his confirmation and a \"coordinated effort to destroy my good name.\"\nKavanaugh said the allegations \"debase our public discourse\" and are \"a threat to any many or woman who wishes to serve our country.\"\n\"Such grotesque and obvious character assassination \u2013 if allowed to succeed \u2013 will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from service,\" he wrote. \"I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process.\"\nThe White House weighs in\nOn Monday, President Donald Trump said Kavanaugh is a \" fine man with an unblemished past\" and dismissed the \"highly unsubstantiated statements from people represented by lawyers\" as \"totally political.\"\n\"There is a chance this could be one of the single most unfair, unjust things to happen to a candidate for anything,\" Trump said.\nWhite House spokeswoman Kerri Kupec dismissed Ramirez's allegation as a \"coordinated smear campaign,\" in a statement on Sunday.\n\"This 35-year-old, uncorroborated claim is the latest in a coordinated smear campaign by the Democrats designed to tear down a good man,\" Kupec said. \"This claim is denied by all who were said to be present and is wholly inconsistent with what many women and men who knew Judge Kavanaugh at the time in college say. The White House stands firmly behind Judge Kavanaugh.\"\nMore:Read Christine Blasey Ford's letter detailing the alleged assault by Brett Kavanaugh\nKavanaugh's friends support him\nThe New Yorker said it reached out to many of Ramirez and Kavanaugh's classmates to see if anyone could corroborate her allegation.\nThe magazine said that two of the men Ramirez identified as being in the dorm room where the alleged incident took place, the wife of a third man she said was there, and six more classmates all signed a statement disputing Ramirez's story.\n\"We can say with confidence that if the incident Debbie alleges ever occurred, we would have seen or heard about it \u2013 and we did not,\" the statement read. \"The behavior she describes would be completely out of character for Brett. In addition, some of us knew Debbie long after Yale, and she never described this incident until Brett\u2019s Supreme Court nomination was pending.\"\nMore:Analysis: Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation sets up a high-stakes trade-off for the GOP\nSome recall hearing about the alleged incident\nOne student, who chose to remain anonymous, told The New Yorker that he recalled being told about the alleged incident that night or the next day. He said he was \"100 percent sure\" that the person who told him about it identified Kavanaugh as the student who exposed himself.\nAnother classmate at Yale, now-emergency room doctor Richard Oh, remembered a tearful female student describing the incident but he could not recall who the student was.\nAccording to The New Yorker, Ramirez told her mother and sister at the time that something upsetting had happened to her but did not share details with them because she was too embarrassed.\nKavanaugh's roommate at the time of the alleged incident, James Roche, said he never witnessed Kavanaugh commit any act of sexual misconduct but he told The New Yorker that Kavanaugh was \"frequently incoherently drunk.\"\nRoche became friends with Ramirez, whom he called \"exceptionally honest and gentle.\" He said he could not \"imagine her making this up\" and said it was \"believable\" that Kavanaugh could have been involved in an incident like the one alleged by Ramirez.\nSenate Democrats call for a delay of Thursday hearing\nSenate Democrats are investigating Ramirez's allegation against Kavanaugh, The New Yorker reported, and some have called for a postponement of Kavanaugh's second confirmation hearing.\nCalifornia Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked Chairman Chuck Grassley for \"an immediate postponement of any further proceedings related to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh\" in a letter on Sunday.\nFeinstein called for an FBI investigation into Ramirez's allegation and repeated her call for an FBI investigation into the accusation by Christine Blasey Ford. Ford came forward a week before Ramirez with an allegation that a drunken Kavanaugh held her down and tried to remove her clothes at a party when they were both in high school.\nFord committed on Sunday to testify before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday at 10 a.m. EDT. Committee Republicans have insisted that only Ford and Kavanaugh will be the only witnesses called.\nThe New Yorker reported that Senate Democrats first learned of Ramirez's allegation from a civil rights lawyer."

            "The drought of international hundreds was playing big time in his mind and that\u2019s why the century in the opening T20 International against England \u201cmeans the world\u201d to the talented Indian batsman KL Rahul. Rahul\u2019s unbeaten 54-ball-101 ensured a walk in the park for India as they chased down 160 against the home team on Tuesday.\n\u201cThis is very satisfying. I have a few international hundreds, but this means the world to me. This is very special because the last international hundred I got was about two years ago,\u201d Rahul told senior teammate Dinesh Karthik during an interview for the bcci.tv.\nThe earlier century he was referring to was against England in a Test match \u2014 199 in Chennai in 2016. Rahul admitted that it has been a rough road for him as far as his place in the limited overs squad is concerned.\n\u201cI have been getting fifties in the IPL and Test matches, been in and out of the one-day team. It\u2019s been a rough road in the last one, one-and-a-half years with injuries, going out. I haven\u2019t chased anything this much, with so much heart and passion, so this innings means the world to me,\u201d a beaming Rahul said.\nThe common refrain among most international cricketers is that they don\u2019t chase numbers but Rahul said that when the three-figure mark eludes a player, he values it even more.\n\u201cBeing out of form is getting out in single-digits, but that wasn\u2019t happening. I was getting starts, I was batting well. Obviously a couple of injuries, going in and out of the team . . . not finding a spot after some time has always been tough.\n\u201cSo to get that opportunity and deliver, to get that three-figure mark \u2013 I\u2019ve always said that I\u2019ve not been somebody who has chased numbers, but when I wasn\u2019t getting the three-figure mark, that\u2019s when I really realised how important three figures was.\u201d"

        "articles": [
            "Kawasaki just released its 2019 KX450F, complete with electric start, a redesigned motor, a hydraulic clutch and a coil-spring Showa fork. Here\u2019s what Kawasaki\u2019s PR department says about it:\nThe Kawasaki KX\u2122 lineup has an unmatched history of success and has paved the path to championships for the motocross heroes of today, while continuing to serve as the ultimate tool for the future stars of tomorrow. The KX family is the most dominant motocross and supercross brand of motorcycle available today, led by its flagship model the KX\u2122450. The all-new 2019 KX450 weighs in at 232.4 lbs without fuel while boasting a powerful engine, nimble handling, and technologically advanced features that are derived directly from the motorcycles used by Kawasaki\u2019s factory race team. All-new features for 2019 include a new lightweight, more powerful engine, new slimmer aluminum frame, new Showa coil spring front forks with A-KIT technology, new hydraulic clutch and new electric start system.\nThe KX450 motorcycle is the bike that builds champions. Kawasaki racers also receive the benefit of the industry-leading Team Green\u2122 support network that can be found trackside at events across the nation. The Kawasaki KX450 is notorious for asserting its championship proven dominance across the world.\nThe hydraulic clutch on the new Kawasaki KX450F is the first we\u2019ve seen on a production Japanese bike.\nENGINE\nNEW Kawasaki\u2019s first electric start motocross bike\nNEW hydraulic clutch\nNEW finger-follower valve train designed by Kawasaki\u2019s World Superbike engineers\nNEW aggressive cam profiles\nNEW larger intake and exhaust valves\nNEW lightweight bridged-box piston\nNEW thinner air cleaner element\nNEW downdraft-style intake routing\nNEW longer exhaust header pipe\nNEW larger 44 mm throttle body\nNEW change drum and shift fork reduce weight\nNEW plain bearings for the connecting rod big-end\nNEW compact fuel pump\nThe engine of the KX450 has always been strong, and the lightweight engine package is even stronger in 2019 thanks to the input from the factory race team. The four-stroke, single cylinder, DOHC, water-cooled 449 cc engine has increased peak power and a flatter torque curve that makes it easier to get on the gas sooner.\nNew for 2019, the KX450 becomes Kawasaki\u2019s first motocross bike with an electric start, which is activated by the push of a button located on the handlebar near the right grip making starting easy and convenient. A lightweight, compact Li-ion battery helps keep weight down, as does an automatic centrifugal decompression system fitted to the exhaust cam, which lifts one exhaust valve to facilitate starting.\nIn addition to an electric start, the KX450 also becomes Kawasaki\u2019s first motocross bike equipped with a hydraulic clutch. The new clutch offers a more direct feel and an easier pull for lighter lever action, helping to reduce fatigue while on the racetrack. The hydraulic clutch is designed to provide a more consistent feeling through minimal change in clutch play as the clutch heats up during heavy use.\nKawasaki brought top-level road racing technology to the KX450 valve train, using designs from Kawasaki World Superbike engineers. It uses finger-follower valve actuation, enabling larger-diameter valves and more aggressive cam profiles. Thanks to the finger-follower valve actuation, the rev-limit has been raised, contributing to increased high-rpm performance. The change to finger-follower valve actuation reduces the valve train mass and friction compared to a tappet-style valve actuation. A DLC coating on the finger followers helps protect against wear.\nComplementing more aggressive cams, larger 40 mm intake valves and 33 mm exhaust valves with increased lift help air flow and contribute to increased power. Valves are formed from lightweight titanium, reducing reciprocating weight and offering high-rpm reliability. Chromium steel valve spring retainers and a highly durable chromium nitride coating on the camshafts improve reliability at high-rpm. The lightweight bridged-box piston uses the same design as the Monster Energy\u00ae Kawasaki race team\u2019s factory race bikes, contributing to strong performance throughout the entire rpm range. The revised piston design reduces weight and optimizes strength for durability.\nThe cylinder is offset 8.5 mm forward to reduce mechanical loss through friction from the piston movement, enabling more efficient power generation. A special coating used on the intake port cores during the casting process make ports ultra-smooth, which increases efficiency and performance throughout the rpm range.\nThe new header pipe length has been increased by 105 mm to match the updated engine package and improves low-end power. A resonator chamber fitted to the exhaust system header effectively increases exhaust pipe length and helps reduce the decibel sound level. A new thinner air cleaner element improves air flow, contributing to increased performance at all rpm. New downdraft-style intake routing allows an even straighter approach for intake air into the cylinder, improving cylinder-filling efficiency and contributing to increased engine power. The new 44 mm throttle body is now larger and features reversed orientation of the butterfly for better fuel atomization from the top mounted injector. A new fine atomizing, 12-hole injector now sprays 75 micron droplets and flows over 20 percent more fuel to contribute to increased power, smooth power delivery and superb engine response at partial throttle.\nA close-ratio five-speed transmission features lightweight gears and shafts to keep weight down, yet retain strength, while contributing to the motorcycle\u2019s winning performance. Revisions have been made to the shift drum and shift fork, resulting in a weight savings. The engine cases, which feature a scavenger pump on the right case, have been constructed of extremely light materials and are designed to meet the highest standards of durability. A change from needle bearings to plain bearings for the connecting rod big-end reduces mechanical loss, contributing to overall performance.\nThe new lightweight fuel pump is located in the plastic fuel tank and has a revised design that is more compact, enabling a flatter design for the top of the tank.\nDFI COUPLERS\nNEW Ability to adjust mapping while engine is running\nContributing to the race-winning engine characteristics, the digital fuel injection system of the KX450 features a coupler package that has set the industry standard. Each KX450 motorcycle comes standard with three different couplers, easily allowing riders to select pre-programmed fuel injection and ignition mapping to suit their riding style or track conditions. The four-pin DFI\u00ae couplers select maps that are designed for standard, hard or soft terrain settings. Changing the engine map is as simple as connecting the coupler cap of choice. For riders looking to fine tune their ECU settings, the KX FI Calibration Kit (Handheld) is offered as a Kawasaki Genuine Accessory, and provides access to the fully programmable ECU. The handheld device eliminates the need for a trackside laptop and gives riders the ability to create custom maps for precise adjustment of fuel and ignition settings. The user-friendly device can store up to seven preset maps and is PC-compatible. For 2019, maps can now be changed while the engine is running by changing couplers, eliminating the need to shut off the engine.\nLAUNCH CONTROL\nThe launch control system of the KX450 motorcycle is a favorite for riders who are focused on getting to the first turn ahead of their competition. The push-button activation retards ignition timing in first and second gear, helping maximize traction and put the bike\u2019s potent power to the ground. Once the rider shifts into third gear, normal ignition mapping immediately resumes and full power is restored.\nThe 2019 Kawasaki KX450F frame is said to be narrower and more rigid.\nCHASSIS\nNEW slimmer aluminum perimeter frame\nNEW engine used as a stressed member for rigidity balance\nNEW swingarm with revised rigidity to match the main frame\nKawasaki\u2019s engineering team has worked closely with the factory racing team to develop an industry-leading slim aluminum perimeter frame that is capable of providing precise cornering through excellent front-end feel and the ultimate agility at high speeds. As an evolution of the current design, the new frame boasts increased overall rigidity balance. The frame\u2019s lightweight construction is composed of forged, extruded and cast parts, while the engine is used as a stressed member and adds to the frames rigidity balance. The overall rigidity balance has been increased through a new steering head area with optimized rigidity, main frame rails with revised cross-section, and a revised line for the swingarm brackets. Lower frame rails have been widened and also contribute to the bikes overall rigidity balance. Forged chain adjusters are also equipped with a self-locking rear axle nut. The axle nut holds 80 lb-ft torque without the need of a cotter pin, simplifying maintenance at the track.\nThe KX450 motorcycle also features a new lightweight swingarm that has revised rigidity and was designed to match the frame, and contributes to increased traction at the rear wheel. The alloy swingarm is constructed of a cast front section and twin tapered hydro-formed spars in a raw aluminum finish. With center of gravity and balanced handling in mind, engineers carefully placed the dimension of the swingarm pivot, output sprocket, and rear axle locations, so that the rear tire would drive the bike forward.\nSUSPENSION & BRAKES\nNEW Showa 49 mm coil spring fork with A-KIT technology\nNEW revised linkage ratios\nNEW rear shock layout and Uni-Trak\u00ae rear suspension\nNEW front brake master cylinder\nNEW larger 250 mm rear disc\nNEW rear brake master cylinder and hose\nNEW larger-diameter 22 mm front axle\nFor 2019, the KX450 motorcycle is equipped with new high-performance Showa 49 mm coil spring front forks with A-KIT technology, which feature large diameter inner tubes that are the same size as those found on Kawasaki\u2019s factory racing team\u2019s bikes and enable the use of large damping pistons for smooth action and firm damping. A hard titanium coating on the outer surface of the fork inner tubes helps prevent wear abrasion. The increased surface hardness of the dark navy blue coating also helps to prevent scratches and damage to the tubes. As a result of the surface remaining smoother for a longer period, the reduction of friction creates a smoother and more enjoyable ride. A Showa \u201cDimplush\u2122\u201d finish process plus Kashima Coat creates a micro-dimpled surface on the inner walls of the outer fork tubes to improve oil retention, and helps prevent wear abrasion on the inside of the tubes, ensuring the sliding surfaces remain smooth for a long time, while the outside is protected against corrosion. The A-KIT technology used in valving, surface treatments and finishes, contributes to noticeably smoother suspension action at the initial part of the stroke and a better ride feel. Incredibly precise personalized settings can be found with 16-position compression and 16-position rebound adjustments.\nOn the rear suspension, a new Kawasaki Uni-Trak\u00ae linkage system is designed to work in conjunction with the new shock, new aluminum frame and new swingarm. The linkage, which is mounted below the swingarm, allows for a longer rear suspension stroke and allows more precise rear suspension tuning. The linkage ratios have been revised to help keep the rear wheel planted for increased traction. The Showa shock layout has been shifted 5 mm to the right to allow room for the new downdraft-style engine intake and increases rear wheel traction. The new Showa Compact Design rear shock has A-KIT technology with bigger diameter compression adjuster, improving damping on the high frequency movements found on today\u2019s motocross tracks. Dual compression adjustability can be found on the rear shock, allowing high-speed and low-speed damping to be adjusted separately. The fully adjustable shock allows for settings to be personalized for riding preference and conditions.\nAn oversized 270 mm, petal-shaped front brake rotor from the renowned manufacturer, Braking, is fitted to keep up with the powerful engine of the KX450 and help riders brake harder and later than the competition. The front brake master cylinder has been revised and offers better initial control, while contributing to overall braking performance and consistency. The rear is equipped with a new larger-diameter 250 mm petal-shaped Braking\u00ae rotor that matches the large front disc and contributes to stronger stopping power. The rear brake master cylinder and hose have been revised to reduce weight.\nDerived from Kawasaki\u2019s factory racing efforts, front-end traction has been improved thanks to a new larger-diameter 22 mm front axle shaft. Dunlop MX3S tires contribute to increased front and rear traction.\nADJUSTABILITY\nNEW lighter and wider footpegs\nKawasaki continues its unmatched commitment towards providing riders with class-leading ERGO-FIT\u2122 comfort thanks to its adjustable handlebar mounting system and footpegs to fit a variety of riders and riding styles. The handlebars feature four-way adjustable mounts. The multi-position handlebars offer two mounting holes with 35 mm of adjustability, and the 180-degree offset clamps boast four individual settings to suit different size riders. The new lighter footpegs are 5 mm wider and positioned 3 mm further rearward, offering excellent grip and making it easier to weight the pegs. The footpegs feature dual-position mounting points, with a lower position that reduces the standard setting by an additional 5 mm. The lower position effectively lowers the center of gravity when standing, and reduces knee angle when taller riders are seated.\nBODYWORK & SEAT\nNEW bodywork designed to facilitate rider movement\nNEW slimmer single piece radiator shrouds\nNEW flatter and lower fuel tank\nNEW smooth engine covers\nComplementing its championship proven technology, the 2019 KX450 motorcycle features aggressive styling along with in-mold graphics on the radiator shrouds that result in an ultra-smooth surface and racy look needed to finish at the top of its class. The sleek bodywork has been molded to match the V-mounted radiators and narrow chassis design. The flatter fuel tank design allows the tip of the seat to be 20 mm lower and gives the rider greater freedom of movement when changing riding position, and facilitates sitting farther forward.\nEach piece of bodywork has been designed to help facilitate rider movement with long, smooth surfaces that make it easy to slide back and forth. New single piece shrouds are slimmer where they come to contact with the rider\u2019s legs and are easier to hold on to. Seams between the shrouds, seat, and side covers are nearly flush in order to increase bike control as well as moving around on the motorcycle.\nAdding to the distinctive Kawasaki factory race team look is a green oil cap, generator cover plugs, green alumite suspension adjusters, and black alumite wheels. Engine covers were designed to be smooth in order to not impede rider movement.\nThe 2019 Kawasaki KX450 motorcycle can easily be made to suit a large range of riders thanks to its flat seat design, adjustable handlebar and footpegs and adjustable suspension components. This perfectly complements the wide range of damping settings as well as the DFI couplers and optional handheld KX FI Calibration Kit, allowing the rider to find the ideal engine characteristics to suit a particular track or conditions. While the base settings on the KX450 motorcycle are based on extensive testing and racing, the motorcycle provides a huge range of technology and adjustment to help ensure every rider can experience the incredible ability of this extremely capable motocross bike.\nCONTINGENCY\nKawasaki Team Green Racing Contingency for 2019 supercross, motocross, and off-road racing are set to be announced and include the all-new KX450. Highlights of the contingency program include increased payouts in off-road racing and more privateer support in both supercross and motocross.\nColor: Lime Green\nMSRP: $9299\nAvailability: Now\nwww.kawasaki.com."

            "Updated, Nov. 14: We've added photo comparisons between the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Note 9.\nThere used to be no dispute as to which Samsung phone was the company's big-screen beast. The Galaxy Note series featured the largest displays, the most processing oomph, and the features most obviously geared toward anyone who subscribed to the theory that Bigger Is Almost Always Better.\nGalaxy S10 Plus, S10 (left) and Note 9\nThat question became a bit more complex when the Galaxy S10 lineup came out this spring, highlighted by the Galaxy S10 Plus, one of the best phones we saw in 2019. The S10 Plus' display is every bit as big as what you'd find on Samsung phablets like the Galaxy Note 9, and the 6.1-inch Galaxy S10 isn't that much smaller. What's more, Samsung has packed the kind of features into the Galaxy S10 that used to be firmly in the Note's domain. As a result, the choice of which big-screen Samsung phone to get isn't as clear as it was before.\nWe've reviewed both the S10 Plus and S10, with enough hands-on time to compare and contrast these two phones with the older Note 9. Here's how these big-screen Samsung phones compare at this point.\nIf you're looking for something newer, then check our Galaxy Note 9 vs. Galaxy Note 20 face-off to see how Samsung's newest Note phone fares.\nEditors' Note: Since this face-off was first published, Samsung updated its Note lineup over the summer, introducing the Galaxy Note 10 and Galaxy Note 10 Plus. To see how Samsung's newer phablets compare to the S10 lineup, check out our Note 10 vs. Galaxy S10 face-off.\nPhone\nGalaxy S10\nGalaxy S10 Plus\nGalaxy Note 9\nStarting Price\n$899 (opens in new tab)\n$999 (opens in new tab)\n$999\nScreen (Resolution)\n6.1-inch Dynamic AMOLED (3040 x 1440) 6.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED (3040 x 1440) 6.4-inch Super AMOLED (2960 x 1440) CPU\nSnapdragon 855\nSnapdragon 855 Snapdragon 845 RAM\n8GB\n8GB/12GB\n6GB/8GB\nStorage\n128GB, 512GB\n128GB, 512GB/1TB\n128GB/512GB\nMicroSD?\nYes, up to 512GB\nYes, up to 512GB Yes, up to 512GB Rear Camera\n16-MP ultra-wide (f/2.2), 12-MP dual-pixel wide (f/1.5, f/2.4), 12-MP telephoto (f/2.4) 16-MP ultra-wide (f/2.2), 12-MP dual-pixel wide (f/1.5, f/2.4), 12-MP telephoto (f/2.4)\nDual 12-MP (f/1.5, f/2.4) Front Camera\n10-MP dual-pixel (f/1.9)\n10-MP dual-pixel (f/1.9), 8-MP depth sensing\n8-MP (f/1.7)\nFingerprint Sensor\nUltrasonic in-display\nUltrasonic in-display Rear-mounted\nBattery\n3,4,00 mAh\n4,100 mAh\n4,000 mAh\nBattery Life (Hrs:Mins)\nTBD\n12:35\n11:26\nS Pen Support?\nNo\nNo\nYes\nSize\n5.9 x 2.77 x 0.3 inches 6.2 x 2.91 x 0.3 inches 6.3 x 3 x 0.3 inches Weight\n5.5 ounces\n6.2 ounces\n7.1 ounces\nColors\nFlamingo Pink, Prism Black, Prism White, Prism Blue, Prism Green Flamingo Pink, Prism Black, Prism White, Prism Blue, Prism Green, Ceramic White, Ceramic Black Lavender Purple, Ocean Blue, Cloud Silver, Midnight Black\nDesign and Display\nWhen comparing the Galaxy S10 and the Galaxy Note 9, it's hard to start anywhere other than the displays. That's because the S10 Plus model now features a 6.4-inch OLED panel stretching from edge to edge, just like the Note 9.\nGalaxy S10 Plus and S10\nBut there are some key differences with that screen. The resolution on the S10 Plus is a bit sharper at 3040 x 1440 to the Note 9's 2960 x 1440. The S10 Plus also uses Samsung's new Dynamic OLED panel, which should feature a wider range of colors due to its support for dynamic-tone mapping. The 6.1-inch S10 offers the same resolution as the S10 Plus on its Dynamic OLED screen\nGalaxy S10 Plus\nThat said, when we tested the S10 Plus' display, it registered 136.5% of the sRGB color gamut, compared to 224% for the Note 9. The S10 Plus displays colors more accurately, with a Delta-E score of 0.29 to the Note 9's 0.34. (Numbers closer to zero are better.) The S10 Plus has a slightly brighter screen as well (625 nits versus 604 nits for the Note 9), though we got that number by shining a flashlight at the S10's sensor.\nThe smaller S10 compares more favorably, capturing 208.2% of the sRGB color gamut. Its Delta-E rating of 0.38 was a shade worse than the Note 9's score. And the S10 is plenty bright, too, with a reading of 611 nits.\nSamsung's phones also achieve their edge-to-edge displays in different ways. The Note 9 features a bezel at the top to house its front-facing camera. But the S10 and S10 Plus opt for Samsung's new Infinity O display and its punch-hole design, where the camera is housed in a cutout in the middle of the screen. (In the S10 Plus's case, that cutout contains two front cameras, as we'll discuss in a moment.) The end result is that the S10 Plus squeezes more screen into a smaller form factor than the Note 9, but that punch hole could stand out when you're using apps or watching videos that fill the whole screen.\nGalaxy Note 9\nRegarding form factor, the S10 Plus is a little shorter and less wide than the Note 9 at 6.2 x 2.91 x 0.3 inches. It weighs less, too, tipping the scales at 6.17 ounces to the Note 9's 7.1 ounces. With its smaller screen, the S10 is the most compact of the bunch at 5.9 x 2.77 x 0.3 inches and 5.5 ounces. (There's an even smaller version, the Galaxy S10e, but it lacks some of the higher-end features of the S10 and S10 Plus and really isn't much of an alternative to the Note 9.)\nAnother big design change becomes apparent when you spend some time with the phones. The S10 and S10 Plus use an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor that fits underneath their displays. (A modest cutout gives you a clue as to where to place your finger to unlock your phone.) The Note 9, like other recent Samsung phones, puts the fingerprint sensor on the back. (Though thankfully, it's beneath the dual cameras instead of next to the lenses.)\nMORE: Best Galaxy S10 Deals Right Now\nYou'll get contrasting choices in colors depending on which phone you favor. The Note 9 comes in four shades \u2014 Lavender Purple, Ocean Blue, Cloud Silver and Midnight Black. S10 shoppers can choose between Flamingo Pink (unless you're in the U.K.), Prism Black, Prism White and Prism Blue. (If you're outside the U.S., add Prism Green to the mix.) Higher-capacity versions of the S10 Plus come in Ceramic Black or Ceramic White.\nWinner: Galaxy S10\nCameras\nSamsung introduced dual cameras to its flagship phones with the Note 8, and the Note 9 continued that tradition with a pair of 12-megapixel shooters. The S10 and S10 Plus up the ante by adding a third lens to the back \u2014 a 16-MP ultra-wide-angle camera joins the 12-MP main lens and 12-MP telephoto shooter. (The 6.1-inch Galaxy S10 features this triple-lens setup, too.)\nGalaxy Note 9\nThat means either S10 model will give you the option of pulling back when you want a shot that captures more of the surrounding details, while also letting you zoom in as you can with the Note 9. The S10 main dual-pixel camera has the same variable aperture as the Note 9 that lets in more light when you're taking pictures in the dark.\nGalaxy Note 9\nThe secret sauce to the Note 9's camera was artificial intelligence, capable of recognizing different scenes and adjusting camera settings accordingly. The S10 models add more smarts to now recognize 30 different scenes, compared with the Note 9's 20.\nUp front, you get more lenses on the S10 Plus, too. There's an 8-MP depth-sensing camera joining the 10-MP selfie cam on Samsung's newest phone. The Note 9 gets by with a single 8-MP lens up front. Samsung says the two lens on the S10 Plus can improve the bokeh effects on portrait shots, and that the new phone's front cameras can capture Ultra-HD video, too.\nWe pitted the Galaxy S10 Plus against the Note 9 in a camera face-off. (The camera set-ups on the S10 and S10 Plus are pretty much the same, save for that extra selfie cam on the S10 Plus, so we'd expect similar results if we used Samsung's S10 in a photo face-off with the Note 9.) There wasn't much separating the two phones, and in some tests, the Note 9 actually did better than the newer models. This indoor shot of baked goods, for example, features better contrast in the Note 9's image, without as much color saturation. The Note 9 also performed better in low light.\nOnce outside, though, we began to see the benefits of the triple lenses on the Galaxy S10 Plus. The ultra-wide lens let us pull back and capture more details, and when we used the telephoto lens, as in this shot of some tulips, the S10 Plus did a better job handling shadows.\nThe S10 Plus also fared better when taking group portraits and selfies. In this self-portrait, a lot of sunlight comes streaming in from the left, and it proves too much for the Note 9 to handle with some of my colleague Adam's face washed out in the final shot. The S10 Plus' effort is better balanced and background details look sharper.\nWinner: Galaxy S10\nPerformance\nAfter benchmarking Samsung's phones, we have a clear sense of how the S10 performs compared to the Note 9s. The Note 9 is no performance slouch, running on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 845, the chipset of choice for 2018's flagship Android devices. But all the Galaxy S10 models feature a new system-on-chip, the Snapdragon 855, which Qualcomm says benefits from the biggest performance increase ever for a Snapdragon update. And that makes a big difference in our Galaxy S10 benchmarks.\nOn Geekbench 4, which gauges overall performance, the Galaxy S10 scored 10,813, the best number we've ever seen from an Android device when we ran that test in the spring. (Subsequent Android phones have since topped that number.) The Galaxy S10 Plus was just behind that number, with a 10,732 result\nThe Galaxy Note 9 scored 8,876 on Geekbench 4, so you can expect a better than 20% improvement no matter which S10 model you prefer.\nThe S10 and S10 Plus also topped the Note 9 when we tested graphics using 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme benchmark. The latest Samsung phones turned in respective scores of 5,606 (S10) and 5,648 (S10 Plus), besting the Note 9's 4,639 result by 21-22%.\nThe S10 Plus enjoys an extra advantage when measuring performance because its base model features more RAM. It ships with 8GB of memory, compared with 6GB in the Note 9's base model. You could upgrade to 8GB in the Note 9, but the S10 Plus's variations include a model with up to 12GB of RAM.\nMORE: First Galaxy S10 Benchmarks: Meet the Fastest Android Ever\nThe S10 Plus comes with the same amount of storage in its base model as the Note 9 \u2014 128GB. And while both phones feature a 512GB option, only the S10 Plus lets you buy a phone with 1TB of storage.\nWinner: Galaxy S10\nBattery\nThe 4,000 mAh battery in the Note 9 was the biggest power pack ever included with a Samsung phone. The operative word there is \"was,\" as the S10 Plus features a 4,100 mAh battery. The S10, meanwhile, gets by with a 3,400 mAh battery.\nGalaxy S10\nThe S10 Plus makes use of its bigger battery, lasting 12 hours and 35 minutes on our battery test, where the phone continuously surfs the web over T-Mobile's LTE network until it runs out of power. The Note 9 lasted for 11:26 on that test, and that was with the phone's adaptive display feature turned off. So you can expect the S10 Plus to last more than hour longer than its big-screen sibling. Still, both devices are on our list of the longest-lasting phones.\nWe can't say the same for the Galaxy S10, which suffers from that smaller battery. It lasted 10 hours, 19 minutes on our test, which is a little better than average for a smartphone.\nThe S10 and S10 Plus boast one power management feature you won't find on the Note 9. The new phones' Wireless PowerShare feature lets you use any S10 as a reverse charger to wirelessly power up other devices \u2014 including the Note 9.\nWinner: Galaxy S10\nSoftware and special features\nThe S10 lineup introduces Samsung's new OneUI skin for Android, which is marked by rounder icons and a redesigned layout meant to make it easier to use large phones with just one hand. That last point is relevant to the S10 Plus and its 6.4-inch screen. Of course, Note 9 users have been able to get the OneUI beta since last year, so they're not missing out on this new interface. And the Android 9 Pie update has been rolling out to the Note 9, bringing that phone in line with the OS version that ships on Samsung's new S10 phones. (That said, Samsung has launched a beta for the OneUI 2.0 interface based on Android 10. The S10 is going to get that update; we're not so sure about the Note 9.\nGalaxy Note 9\nIf there's one area where the Note enjoys a big advantage over the Galaxy S lineup, it's the S Pen that comes with Samsung's phablet. The Note 9 saw a particularly welcome improvement to its stylus, as you can now use the S Pen as a remote control.\nGalaxy Note 9\nBy turning the pen into a remote shutter, you can control music playback or even snap a photo. Even with the improvements to the S10 and S10 Plus, Samsung's latest flagships don't offer anything quite like the S Pen that comes with the Note 9.\nWinner: Note 9\nPrice and availability\nThe S10 Plus is the most expensive phone in the new S10 lineup, with a starting price of $999 for the 128GB model with 8GB of RAM. Upgrading your storage to 512GB or 1TB will set you back $1,249, or $1,599. The S10 is a comparative bargain at $899, with an upgrade to 512GB available for $1,149. We keep tabs on the latest Galaxy S10 deals to see if you can get either new model for less.\n(opens in new tab) Galaxy S10: Samsung's flagship starts at $899 for the 6.1-inch version of the phone. If you want a screen to match the Galaxy Note 9, you'll want the $999 Galaxy S10 Plus.\nThe S10 Plus's asking price is in line with what Samsung charged for the Note 9 when it debuted last August. Then, the base model cost $999, while a 512GB Note 9 cost you $1,249. Prices have fallen since the release of the Galaxy Note 10, though not steeply. Most places charge $899 for the older Note now, though you can get a lower price with a trade-in. Check the latest Note 9 deals to see if there are any chances to save on the cost of this phone.\n(opens in new tab) Galaxy Note 9: The arrival of the newer Galaxy Note 10 means a price drop for last year's Note 9. You can now get that phone for anywhere from $725 to $899.\nSince March, the Galaxy S10 is now widely available \u2014 you can buy it from Samsung, all four major U.S. carriers, regional carrier US Cellular, Xfinity Mobile and retailers including Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart. Several prepaid carriers, including Metro by T-Mobile, Boost and Cricket, now offer the phones, too. The Note 9 has been on sale since last year and remains available at most carriers.\nWinner: Galaxy S10\nBottom line\nThe Galaxy S10 is clearly the better phone than its older sibling, winning every category save for special features where the Note 9 is still tops thanks to that powerful S Pen. We think the Galaxy S10 Plus is the best Android phone you can get right now, and if you like the flexibility that the S Pen has to offer, the more recent Galaxy Note 10 is a better big-screen option than last year's Note. The main reason to turn to the Note 9 is to save a little money.\nThe main takeaway here, though, is just how outstanding the Galaxy S10 is, particularly the S10 Plus, which gives the Note some serious competition for Samsung's big-screen phone of choice. The display is just as large as what you get on a Note 9, you'll enjoy better performance, and the new phone's battery lasts longer on a charge.\nf you're a big-phone fan, you've never had a better range of choices for your next handset. And the Galaxy S10 Plus is hard to beat."

            "The death of a 35-year-old German man drew spontaneous protests, organized by several far-right groups. Police struggled to control the rowdy crowds, some members of which allegedly chased and attacked foreigners.\nA street festival in the eastern German city of Chemnitz was canceled on Sunday, hours before it was supposed to conclude, after 800 people took to the streets to protest the death of a 35-year-old man.\nThe victim, said to be of German origin, was stabbed during an altercation that involved 10 people, several of whom were of \"various nationalities,\" police sources said.\nThe brawl took place at around 3 a.m. local time (0100 UTC) on Sunday after the street festival closed on Saturday evening, and began with a verbal dispute. Aside from the victim, two men in their 30s were also stabbed and seriously injured, while two others, aged 22 and 23, were taken into custody.\nFar-right groups mobilize\nPolice had trouble clearing the unruly crowds that gathered Sunday afternoon, which included far-right groups. Authorities said they were generally uncooperative and hurled bottles at the officers. After police were overwhelmed by the spontaneous gathering, reinforcements had to be called from the larger nearby cities of Leipzig and Dresden.\nRead more: City of Chemnitz: A city of clever heads\nThe mobilizations were spontaneous and are said to have originated by calls to demonstrate on social media. Among the groups that urged their supporters to take to the streets were the political party AfD, which is said to have gathered some 100 people on the streets. Bild reported that members of the right-wing \"Kaotic Chemnitz\" football group also were involved.\nVideo footage on social media appeared to show protesters assaulting people they thought looked non-German, but that footage has not yet been verified.\nDW's Melinda Crane, who has been reporting on the incident for DW-TV, called the protests \"absolutely coordinated and incited.\"\nShe said reports of the knifing had quickly found their way onto far-right websites that attributed the attack to migrants of what they called \"southern origin\" and urged people to protest.\nRead more: Germany's Angela Merkel confronts far-right critics in AfD country\nChemnitz mayor: 'Horrified' by events\nPolice sources told German magazine Der Spiegel that several people had filed assault charges, including one German man, a woman of Bulgarian descent and a man of Syrian descent.\nChemnitz Mayor Barbara Ludwig told local media that she was \"horrified\" after seeing what took place in her city on Sunday.\nAuthorities have not yet spoken on what caused the deadly overnight altercation, but according to German media, rumors circulated alleging that the dispute began after a woman was reportedly harassed. Police said these reports had no basis and in a tweet called on the public \"not to take part in speculations.\"\nThe street festival, which ran all weekend, was set to conclude at 8 p.m. local time on Sunday, but was abruptly ended at 4 p.m. due to the confrontation between the police and demonstrators in the afternoon.\nThe right-wing movement \"Pro Chemnitz\" has called on Facebook for more demonstrations on Monday, while leftist groups have planned counterprotests.\njcg/bw (AP, dpa)\nEach evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

            "Credit: WWE.com\nWrestleMania 35 is shaping up to be a wrestling bonanza packed with matches.

Despite what happened on Smackdown this week, all signs still point to the man below.\nKofi Kingston\nAfter battling his way through the gauntlet on Tuesday, Vince McMahon forced a battered and beaten Kingston to face Bryan for his opportunity to challenge him for his title at WrestleMania 35. Kingston put on another in-ring show but fell short as Bryan took advantage of his weakened rival to gain the pinfall.\nThere are still two weeks left before WrestleMania 35. Somehow, Kingston will find himself in a world title match.\nRaw Tag-Team Championships\nThe Revival hold the titles, but it is perhaps the most indeterminate division in the promotion at the moment. The champs had been feuding with Aleister Black and Ricochet, but that team was broken up this week. We should find out something a bit more concrete next week.\nSmackdown Tag-Team Championships\nThe Usos don't have a current rival at the moment since The Miz and Shane McMahon's split. However, the Hardys made an appearance on Smackdown, and it would appear they will challenge for the tag-team titles. It's possible Shinsuke Nakamura and Rusev and The Bar could find their way into the match as well.\nJohn Cena\nGetty\nAlmost no one likes the idea of Kurt Angle's retirement match happening with Baron Corbin. If Angle were to work with Cena, fans would embrace the concept a little more. We've heard nothing about Cena and WrestleMania. If he is added, Cena replacing Corbin is the most likely move.\nThe Undertaker\nGetty\nTaker hasn't even been teased this WrestleMania season. Either the WWE is approaching his annual involvement differently, or he truly isn't competing. There doesn't appear to be a natural spot for him as it is, and with only two weeks before the show, there isn't enough time to develop something of substance."

            "Welcome to your match thread for a Sunday night match-up between Orlando City and D.C. United at Audi Field. It\u2019s the second of two scheduled MLS matches between the clubs this season and the third overall.\nThe Lions will face United with their third coach in as many meetings between the two Eastern Conference sides this season, as James O\u2019Connor gets his first look at D.C. after Jason Kreis and Bobby Murphy led Orlando into battle in the first two installments.\nHistory\nThe Lions are 4-3-1 against D.C. in the all-time league series since the club joined MLS and 4-3-2 in all competitions. Orlando is 1-2-0 on the road against United but this will be the first ever meeting at Audi Field. The two teams met on opening day and the Lions posted a dramatic late 1-1 draw on Stefano Pinho\u2019s 93rd-minute goal. Orlando went down to 10 men 41 minutes into the match when PC was sent off. The teams met in U.S. Open Cup action on June 20 at the Maryland SoccerPlex and again drew 1-1, but the Lions advanced to the quarterfinals thanks to a 4-2 penalty shootout win. Luciano Acosta put the hosts ahead but Justin Meram equalized on a rainy night and that was it for the scoring until the shootout.\nOrlando swept the two league meetings in 2017, starting with a 2-0 win over United at Orlando City Stadium on May 31. Cyle Larin and Giles Barnes provided the offense to help the Lions snap what was then a six-game winless skid. City also snapped an eight-game skid (0-6-2) when the teams met again on Sept. 9, when the Lions had two men sent off but still won, 2-1. Larin and Barnes did the damage again, so United fans will not mind seeing that neither player is on the 2018 OCSC roster. Kofi Opare gave his team a lifeline in the 89th minute but D.C. couldn\u2019t find an equalizer.\nThe teams split two lopsided games in 2016, with each team winning at home. United grabbed a 4-1 win at RFK Stadium and the Lions avenged that loss with a 4-2 win to close their tenure at Camping World Stadium.\nThe Black & Red won the first meeting back on April 3, 2015, with Luis Silva scoring on a 91st-minute free kick, breaking Orlando hearts, 1-0. On May 13 of that inaugural season, Orlando led 1-0 on Larin\u2019s goal, but D.C. scored twice to win, 2-1. Orlando finally got on the board in the series on June 14 that year with Kak\u00e1 scoring off the rebound of his own missed penalty to provide the Lions\u2019 1-0 winning margin.\nMatch Overview\nD.C. will look a bit different this time around. Former England, Everton, and Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney has joined D.C. and brought a bit of swagger to the side. Playing atop one of the league\u2019s most talented attacking midfields \u2014 which includes Yamil Asad, U.S. international Paul Arriola, and Luciano Acosta, Rooney will provide finishing up top for D.C. and he\u2019s already opened his United account.\nThe Lions will be tasked with stopping the powerful attacking force with a back line held together with spit and duct tape. Jonathan Spector (hamstring) and Lamine San\u00e9 (knee) remain out with injuries and PC has been playing left back the last few matches for O\u2019Connor\u2019s squad. Orlando City has conceded seven times in the last two matches.\nThings don\u2019t look much better up top for Orlando. Dom Dwyer should be good to go, but Sacha Kljestan (ankle) didn\u2019t train all week after being chopped down from behind by Brandon Bye in the 3-3 draw vs. New England last Saturday. In addition, Yoshimar Yot\u00fan will miss this match and the next after being sent off in stoppage time of that same game. The midfield could be a trio of Josu\u00e9 Colm\u00e1n between Mohamed El-Munir (left) and Chris Mueller (right), but I wouldn\u2019t rule out a more defensive-minded option in the lineup in the form of Tony Rocha, Will Johnson, or even Dillon Powers. After all, O\u2019Connor was not happy about all the goals conceded the last few weeks.\nI would expect some kind of fluid 4-2-3-1 system, which is what we\u2019ve mainly been seeing from the Lions the last several games. Even if it\u2019s announced as such, it might play more like a 4-3-2-1 at times depending on who is in the attacking midfield and how O\u2019Connor tactically approaches the game.\nOrlando City will have to lock down the midfield and keep D.C.\u2019s attackers from finding Rooney.

            "Sophomore forward Emmanuel Akot is transferring from the Arizona Wildcats, according to Evan Daniels of 247Sports.\nAkot has already left the team, but will finish the spring semester at the UA, per Daniels. The Canadian will likely have to sit out the 2019-20 season before having two years of eligibility at his new school.\nAkot was averaging 3.8 points and 2.8 rebounds in 19.4 minutes this season, starting at power forward in 11 of 17 games.\nThe former five-star recruit especially struggled offensively, shooting just 39 percent from the field and 29 percent from 3 this season. He never scored more than seven points in a game.\nWhile Akot\u2019s decision to transfer is not surprising \u2014 he would have had trouble earning playing time on a more talented Arizona team next season \u2014 the timing means Arizona\u2019s depth will be depleted for the rest of the 2018-19 campaign.\nThe Wildcats are now down to Chase Jeter, Ryan Luther and Ira Lee in the frontcourt, a potentially concerning development for a team that sprinted out to a 4-0 start to Pac-12 play.\nLuther was starting at power forward before being usurped by Akot, but Lee has been playing well lately and has a case to be inserted into the starting five alongside Jeter, who has arguably been UA\u2019s best player this season.\nArizona could add former walk-on Jake DesJardins to the rotation or pull the redshirt from Cornell transfer Stone Gettings to add depth to its frontcourt, but the latter would be a short-sighted way to burn his final year of eligibility. Besides, UA coach Sean Miller said earlier in the season that there is \u201cno chance\u201d Gettings will play this season.\nThe 6-foot-8 forward started practicing with the Wildcats a couple weeks ago after graduating from Cornell in December.\nAkot is the second player to transfer from Arizona this season. Freshman forward Omar Thielemans left the program before the season, eventually landing at Wright State."

            "Associated Press\nMINNEAPOLIS \u2013 Tony Bennett has come a long, long way.\nThe former Green Bay Preble High School and UW-Green Bay star reached the pinnacle of college basketball Monday night. The Virginia coach, with his legendary father Dick in the stands, guided the Cavaliers to a 85-77 victory over Texas Tech in overtime on Monday night in the NCAA championship game.\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy.\nLed by De\u2019Andre Hunter and his NBA-ready game, the Cavaliers turned themselves into national champions, holding off the tenacious, ferocious Red Raiders. The scintillating victory came 388 days after a crushing setback that might have sunk a lesser team for years.\nBut Virginia was better than that.\nBOX SCORE: Virginia 85, Texas Tech 77\nRELATED: Virginia finds redemption by beating Texas Tech\nRELATED: Tony Bennett joins father as Final Four coach\nA season after becoming the first No. 1 seed to lose to a 16 \u2013 the one thing that had never happened in a tournament where anything can \u2013 the Cavaliers watched a 10-point lead turn into a three-point deficit before Hunter came to the rescue. The sophomore made the game-tying three with 12 seconds left in regulation, then made another with just over two minutes left in the extra period to give the Cavs the lead for good.\n\u201cSurreal,\u201d Hunter called it. \u201cIt\u2019s a goal we started out with at the beginning of the season. We knew we were going to bounce back from last year. We achieved our dreams.\u201d\nAfter going scoreless for the first 18 1/2 minutes, Hunter finished with a career-high 27 points, and if he leaves as a lottery pick \u2013 well, what a way to go.\nHe helped the Cavs bring home the first NCAA title for a program with a colorful, star-crossed and, now, very winning history.\nRalph Sampson was in the house, but now it\u2019s possible that Sampson and the name \u201cChaminade\u201d won\u2019t be at the top of Virginia\u2019s resume anymore.\nOr \u201cUniversity of Maryland-Baltimore County.\u201d That was the No. 16 seed that stunned the Cavs in the first round last year, its playful social media manager online Monday night tweeting congratulations shortly after the final buzzer. Hunter missed that game with a broken wrist, but nobody thought they\u2019d miss him THAT much.\nEach of Virginia\u2019s 34 wins leading to the final, and each of its scant three losses, were all punctuated by the reminder that only the end result would serve as the ultimate report card on whether the Cavs could truly shed the baggage of last year.\nWhat a ride this was.\nA 1 seed once again, they fell behind by 14 early to 16th-seeded Gardner-Webb in this year\u2019s opening round, and a nightmare seemed to be unfolding. But this time, they overcame it. Then, they beat Purdue in the Elite Eight when the game looked lost, and did the same against Auburn on Saturday \u2013 getting bailed out by a foul call and Kyle Guy\u2019s three free throws with 0.6 seconds left.\n\u201cI told them, I just want a chance at a title fight one day,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I want. \u2026 You\u2019re never alone in the hills and the valleys we faced in the last year.\u201d\nHunter\u2019s key three in OT gave Virginia a 75-73 lead, and after the teams traded possessions, Tech guard Davide Moretti scrambled after a loose ball heading onto Virginia\u2019s end of the court. It appeared it would be Texas Tech ball, but a replay showed Moretti\u2019s pinkie finger had barely scraped the ball. Virginia got possession, and worked the ball into Ty Jerome, who got fouled and made two free throws.\nBrandone Francis missed a three on the other end, and Virginia pulled away \u2013 the first time this game felt remotely comfortable, even after Guy made a three to give the Cavs a 10-point lead with 10:22 left in regulation.\nGuy is not Virginia\u2019s only clutch free-throw shooter, by the way. The Cavs went 12 for 12 from the line in overtime to ice this game. They scored the game\u2019s final 11 points.\nAs for the Red Raiders (31-7), well, what can you say?\nThe team full of overlooked grinders refused to quit.\nThey fell behind by 10 twice in this game \u2013 seemingly too much in a matchup between two legendary defenses that allowed way more than the projected total of 118 points \u2013 but just kept coming back.\nJarrett Culver, also lottery-pick material, made a spinning left-handed layup over Hunter with 35 seconds left in regulation to put the Red Raiders ahead 66-65. After Jerome missed a teardrop on the other end, Norense Odiase got fouled and made two free throws to make it 68-65.\nThe nation\u2019s best defense couldn\u2019t afford to give up a three, but Jerome skipped a pass to Hunter, who was open on the wing \u2013 and spotted up and drained it. Culver missed a 3 with Guy in his face with a second left, and we were headed to overtime, the first extra session in the final since Kansas beat Memphis in 2008.\n\u201cIn terms of my guys, I\u2019ve never been more proud,\u201d Red Raiders coach Chris Beard said. \u201cThis is real life. We\u2019ll bounce back.\u201d\nThe last five minutes of regulation and the OT featured several one-on-one matchups between the two NBA-bound stars, and Hunter came out the winner. He finished 8 for 16 after an 0-for-7 start. Culver, who stayed in his hometown of Lubbock to see how far he could take Tech, went 5 for 22 for 15 points, continuing a cold-shooting Final Four; he went 8 for 34 over the weekend.\nBoth will likely move on to the NBA. Hunter will go there with a title.\nAnd somebody on Virginia ought to grab that sign.\nIn the stands, a fan made a cardboard sign with the capital letters \u201cUMBC\u201d running vertically, and this spelled out after each letter. \u201cUva.\u201d \u201cMakes.\u201d \u201cBig.\u201d \u201cComeback.\u201d\nThe Cavs couldn\u2019t have written it any better themselves."

Now, most of the threads left open by these post-credits scenes have been closed - we don't need to see the scenes from Thor and Iron Man again. However, there are a few post-credits scenes that are required viewing ahead of Endgame, if you're prepared for possible spoilers.\nAt the end of Infinity War half the population of the universe was wiped out after Thanos collected all the Infinity Stones. Heroes like Black Panther, Scarlet Witch, Bucky, and many others turned to dust instantly. The post-credits scenes shows everyone's favorite eye patch, Nick Fury, also turn to dust. Luckily, he was able to call Captain Marvel for help before fading away.\npic.twitter.com/V5MhEVGjD6April 22, 2019 See more\nWhile Ant-Man wasn't a part of Infinity War, he and Wasp did have their own adventure in San Francisco at the same time as the events of Infinity War. During the post-credits sequence we see Ant-Man jump into the quantum realm to gather more energy. As he jumps in, Wasp, Hope Pym, and Hank Pym are all dusted leaving Ant-Man stranded in the quantum realm.\nTrailers for Endgame show Ant-Man having already escaped from the quantum realm, but his escape should still be a important plot point.\n\u201cGuys?!\u201d pic.twitter.com/Yrt6MREuTtApril 22, 2019 See more\nLastly, there's Captain Marvel. At the end of Brie Larson's '90s-fueled adventure, we see her return to Earth after the events of Infinity War to meet up with the surviving cast of the Infinity War. It's clear that Captain Marvel is crucial in the plan to defeat Thanos.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Fury?\u201d pic.twitter.com/NxJ4sQeqDcApril 22, 2019 See more\nAll these mysteries should get wrapped up this weekend, and we're beyond excited to see how Marvel closes it all out."

However, a number of websites with gov.pk domain IDs mentioned in the list, do appear to be hacked.\nOn Saturday, the official website of Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs was also reportedly hacked. Pakistan foreign ministry spokesperson Mohammad Faisal had said complaints were received about the site being inaccessible by users from several countries.\nThe hacking of the website of Pakistan's foreign ministry comes after a ghastly terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district on Thursday.\nIn one of the worst-ever terrorist attacks in India, a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) suicide bomber blew up an explosive-laden vehicle near a CRPF convoy on Thursday, killing at least 40 personnel.\nMore than 2,500 CRPF personnel, many of them returning from leave to rejoin duty in the Valley, were travelling in the convoy of 78 vehicles when they were ambushed in the Srinagar-Jammu highway around 3.15 pm.\nOver 50 countries have condemned the barbaric attack and expressed support to India in its fight against terrorism. Following the deadly assault, India revoked the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status accorded to Pakistan.\nHere's the list of some of the 'hacked' websites:\nhttps://sindhforests.gov.pk/op.html\nhttps://mail.sindhforests.gov.pk/op.html,\nhttps://pkha.gov.pk/op.html\nhttps://ebidding.pkha.gov.pk/op.html,\nhttps://mail.pkha.gov.pk/op.html\nhttp://kda.gkp.pk/op.html,\nhttp://blog.kda.gkp.pk/op.html,\nhttp://mail.kda.gkp.pk/op.html,\nhttps://kpsports.gov.pk/op.html,\nhttps://mail.kpsports.gov.pk/op.html,\nhttp://seismic.pmd.gov.pk/op.html\nhttp://namc.pmd.gov.pk/op.html\nhttp://rmcpunjab.pmd.gov.pk/FlightsChartFolder/op.html\nhttp://ffd.pmd.gov.pk/modis/op.html\nhttp://radar.pmd.gov.pk/islamabad/op.html,\nhttp://pjm.pmd.gov.pk/cache/op.html\nhttp://202.163.66.44:811/14-02-2019.html\nhttp://www.urbanunit.gov.pk/upload/14-02-2019.php\nhttps://opf.edu.pk/14-02-2019.php"

            "Heat vs. Celtics Spread Prediction\nThe Boston Celtics have won seven of their last 10 games and cashed for bettors in six of those contests over that span. That said, are the laying too many points to the visiting Miami Heat at 6:00 p.m. ET on Monday?\nGame Snapshot\n521 Miami Heat at 522 Boston Celtics\n6:00 p.m. ET, Monday, January 21, 2019\nTD Garden, Boston, Massachusetts\nOur NBA Live Odds page pulls spreads and totals from multiple different online sportsbooks so you can compare betting odds to ensure you\u2019re getting the best line.\nPublic Betting Trends\nAccording to oddsmakers from online sportsbook BetNow.eu, the Celtics are 8-point favorites to beat the Heat. The total, meanwhile, sits at 215.5 points and as of this writing, 55% of the public betting tickets wagered at online sportsbooks are on the Celtics to cover the point spread.\nMiami Heat Fantasy Spin\nJosh Richardson (illness) scored a game-high 26 points Saturday vs. the Bulls, shooting 10-of-15 from the field and 2-of-2 from the foul line, with three rebounds, two assists and four 3-pointers in 30 minutes. There were questions regarding Richardson\u2019s status earlier Saturday, but he managed to play through illness and put forth one of his better scoring efforts of the season. The 26 points are the most that the fourth-year guard has scored in a game since early November, and he made four 3-pointers in a game for the third time this month. Richardson picked a good time to have an outing of this caliber, as he\u2019s shooting just 41.1% from the field and 32.4% from three in January.\nBoston Celtics Fantasy Spin\nJayson Tatum shot a respectable 7-of-13 from the field Saturday vs. the Hawks, finishing with 19 points (5-of-5 FTs), five rebounds, two assists, one steal and three blocks in 35 minutes. Like many of his teammates not named Kyrie Irving, Tatum was quiet offensively in the first half. The second-year wing was more productive in the second half, ultimately putting together a solid stat line that had a little bit of everything outside of three-pointers (he did not attempt one). A nice bounce back for a player who missed all six of his shot attempts Friday night, finishing with a season-low two points. Tatum\u2019s three blocked shots were one short of his high for the season to date.\nNBA Betting Trends\nMiami\nThe Heat are just 5-11-3 against the spread in their last 19 games following a win of more than 10 points.\nBoston\nThe Celtics have cashed in 17 of their last 21 home games versus an opponent with a winning road record.\nPrediction\nThe Heat have been a solid play in this series, covering in five of their last six meetings with the Celtics and posting a 5-2 ATS record in their last seven trips to Boston. The road team is also 6-2 against the number in the last eight meetings between these two teams while the underdog is a highly profitable 16-5 at the betting window in the last 21 meetings. While the Heat might not pull off the outright upset, they should stay within the 8 points.\nMonday NBA Prediction: Miami Heat +8"

            "Nintendo came out with the big guns for its pre-recorded E3 conference this morning, delivering updates on a couple of veteran franchises while also bringing some new titles to its Switch console.\nWe didn\u2019t get a ton of big surprises, but what Nintendo showed off was certainly exciting to a lot of fans. The bulk of the presentation was (as expected) devoted to the intimate minutiae of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, which is arriving at the end of the year and will bring the biggest cast to the game ever, with some new characters arriving alongside the entire cast of the series\u2019 previous iterations.\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate, Super Mario Party and Fortnite were probably the biggest highlights, but let\u2019s take a look at everything they talked about.\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nOne of the crazier parts of this announcement included the fact that Nintendo has made a redesigned GameCube controller, which will be compatible with the game and will be supporting your old GameCube controller somehow as well, presumably with a dongle.\nAvailable December 7, 2018.\nSuper Mario Party\nAlongside the new gameplay content, Super Mario Party is going to integrate some weird multi-Switch gameplay that will allow users to play together across multiple Switch consoles and merge their screens together.\nAvailable October 5, 2018.\nFortnite\nAvailable now for free download.\nOther stuff\nIn addition to the big-gun trifecta of game announcements, Nintendo also shed some light on other titles coming to the system, which has realistically had a pretty tiny game library since launch.\nFire Emblem Three Houses\nComing spring 2019.\nDRAGON BALL FighterZ\nComing 2019.\nXenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna \u2013 The Golden Country\nNew update available September 14 for Expansion Pass members.\nOther titles announced during the Nintendo Direct included Daemon X Machina, Overcooked! 2, Killer Queen Black, Hollow Knight and Octopath Traveler. In terms of the new Pok\u00e9mon titles, Let\u2019s Go, Pikachu! and Let\u2019s Go, Eevee!, they will be available November 16 and people will be able to buy a $99.99 combo that includes the Pok\u00e9 Ball Plus controller, as well.\nSo that\u2019s it; no Metroid Prime news, no Animal Crossing for Switch, no other big teases \u2014 but there\u2019s certainly a good chunk of titles to keep Switch owners excited for a while. We\u2019ll be at E3 checking out some of these new titles this week, so stay tuned for more from us on the ground in Los Angeles."

            "Gift Article Share\nA recent flight to Maui took an unexpected turn as things went from weird to weirder to OH, MY GOD, WHAT IS HAPPENING?!? Before the wheels lifted off the runway at Oakland International Airport on Friday, Hawaiian Airlines Flight 23 hit some . . . emotional turbulence, when more than a dozen passengers received what appeared to be a photo of a macabre crime scene: a lifeless body, facedown, surrounded by dried blood spatter, bullet casings and evidence markers. Terrified, the passengers alerted airline personnel to the \u201cthreatening\u201d photo \u2014 which turned out to be from a teenager's forensic science project, according to reporting from the Mercury News.\nA 15-year-old girl had tried to share the image with her mother via AirDrop \u2014 an iPhone file-sharing method that uses Bluetooth to share photos with nearby devices \u2014 but also made it available to nearby passengers by accident. The plane had already began taxiing, but the pilot returned to the gate after being notified of the photos, delaying the flight an hour and a half while the incident unraveled. The girl and her mother were questioned by Alameda County sheriff's deputies but were cleared of any crime. Sgt. Ray Kelly, a spokesman for the Alameda County Sheriff's Office, said the girl and her mother were extremely embarrassed, and that he'd never heard of anything like this happening on a flight, the Mercury News reported.\nA Hawaii-bound flight was delayed more than an hour this morning at Oakland International Airport when grisly crime-scene photos from a teenage passenger's forensics science project were accidentally shared to the phones of other passengers, causing... https://t.co/YamhTh4lYp \u2014 KPIX 5 (@KPIXtv) September 1, 2018\n\"Given the circumstances, everyone did the right thing,\u201d Kelly told the Mercury News. \u201cThe girl had good intentions, but other passengers saw it as a threat. People were being highly vigilant.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nUltimately, the girl and her mother were booked on a later flight \u2014 which might have been for the better, given what followed.\nHawaiian Airlines Flight 23 would eventually take flight Friday, bearing 256 passengers and 10 crew members. As it glided over the Pacific Ocean, people started complaining about a strange stink spreading throughout the cabin. Midway through the five-hour flight, several passengers began to cough, holding shirts over their mouths, according to tweets from one passenger, Lisa Sakimura, who narrated the entire affair once the plane landed. People called for help and begged for air.\nThen the coughing gets louder. I hear a burly man yell in the back through chokes to \u201cdrop the air!\u201d over and over. I hear people choking now and everyone is asking \u201cwhat\u2019s happening!?\u201d and \u201cwhat\u2019s going on!?\u201d \u2014 Lisa Sakimura (@lbsakimura) August 31, 2018\nThe first cabin and premiere section flood to the back of the plane. Main cabin people are sitting looking wide-eyed and asking questions as we stream through choking and crying. They have no idea what\u2019s going on and what we know isn\u2019t any better. \u2014 Lisa Sakimura (@lbsakimura) August 31, 2018\nAs passengers gasped and cried, attendants hustled people toward the back of the plane, believing the source to be near the first-class cabin, according to Sakimura's tweets. Passengers were given wet napkins to cover their mouths. A baby choked and vomited, said Sakimura, who did not immediately respond to a tweet seeking comment.\nAdvertisement\nThe passengers were trapped with the noxious odor for nearly two hours, until the plane was cleared for an expedited landing and touched down safely in Maui, according to reporting from Hawaii News Now. Officials discovered the mysterious contaminate was a leaky 1.5-ounce can of pepper spray in a passenger's luggage. Bringing pepper spray in a carry-on is illegal, but this canister somehow made it through security at the airport in Oakland.\n\"We know what the cause is,\u201d a firefighter reassured the rattled passengers in a cellphone video taken after the emergency landing. \u201cEveryone is okay.\"\nFirst responders treated 15 people for respiratory issues and have released all of them, Hawaiian Airlines told Hawaii News Now. Local police and the Transportation Security Administration are still investigating the case and have interviewed the owner of the canister to see how it got through security. According to TSA, the passenger could be fined $1,960 for bringing the pepper spray aboard.\nThe airline apologized for the hullabaloo and compensated passengers with a $500 credit.\nGiftOutline Gift Article"

            "Jussie Smollett is facing prison time and the implosion of his career if it turns out he lied about being the target of a hate crime, legal and public relations experts say.\n\u201cThe best thing that Jussie can do is pray and pray a lot,\u201d said Ronn Torossian, founder of 5W Public Relations. \u201cIf he made it up, he has big problems in both the court of law and the court of public opinion.\u201d\nThe \u201cEmpire\u201d star claimed he was beaten up on Jan. 29 by two men who used racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett\u2019s co-stars and colleagues on \u201cEmpire,\u201d celebrities such as Ellen Page and Zendaya, and public figures such as Sen. Kamala Harris rallied behind the actor, releasing statements of support. However, Smollett\u2019s account is now being challenged, with police investigating whether or not he paid two acquaintances, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, to stage the attack.\nChicago police confirmed on Tuesday that they received a tip from someone claiming to have seen the three men together in an elevator of Smollett\u2019s apartment building on the evening of the attack. However, later in the day, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted that the tip was unfounded.\nIf Smollett falsified a police report, the charge is a Class 4 felony in Illinois, and carries a potential sentence of one to three years in prison. Smollett could also be ordered to pay restitution to compensate for the cost of the Chicago Police Department investigation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very, very serious situation,\u201d said Phil Turner, a former federal prosecutor who now works in criminal defense in Chicago. \u201cHe\u2019s got some very significant exposure.\u201d\nSmollett told police that two men attacked him at 2 a.m., poured bleach on him, and put a noose around his neck. He also claimed they told him that it was \u201cMAGA country,\u201d a reference to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign slogan. Chicago investigators are now seeking to speak with Smollett.\nFederal investigators are also probing a threatening letter that was sent to the \u201cEmpire\u201d set. The letter included homophobic language and contained a white powder, which was later determined to be a crushed painkiller tablet. Should that letter turn out to be fake, federal prosecutors could also pursue a mail fraud charge, legal experts say.\nAndrew Weisberg, a former prosecutor in the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, said Smollett could get probation, assuming that he has a clean record. But he also said prosecutors may face pressure not to be lenient.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very high-profile case,\u201d he said. \u201cProsecutors tend to be tougher because everybody\u2019s watching. \u2026 I think they may come down hard, in terms of not reducing it to a misdemeanor.\u201d\nSteve Greenberg, a Chicago defense attorney, said prosecutors could also file a charge of obstruction of justice. He said it was likely, though, that Smollett would be allowed to plead to a misdemeanor, and not serve jail time.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to ruin a guy\u2019s life over this,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cPeople make false reports all the time to the police. They get in a DUI, they call police and say, \u2018My car was stolen.\u2019 Ninety percent of the time, even if they\u2019re charged with a felony, those people end up pleading to a misdemeanor.\u201d\nSmollett has retained two criminal defense attorneys, Victor Henderson and Todd Pugh. They have denied that Smollett staged the attack, and said he will continue to cooperate.\n\u201cHis lawyers may be having a psychiatrist examine the guy so they could prepare some kind of psychiatric defense,\u201d Turner said.\nSmollett, like celebrity fabulists such as Lance Armstrong and Ryan Lochte, may see endorsement opportunities and roles dry up if he is found to have been untruthful. Public relations experts say he will need to demonstrate that he\u2019s learned a lesson.\n\u201cIf he made this up, he broke the trust of a lot of his fans,\u201d said Ray Drasnin, founder of Purple Penguin PR. \u201cSay you lied and you\u2019re sorry for that lie. Apologize to the people who have supported you, promise to make it up, and find a cause that\u2019s near and dear to your heart and devote yourself to it.\u201d\nRichard Levick, chairman and CEO of LEVICK, said people shouldn\u2019t rush to judgment regarding Smollet and cautioned that there are still, in the words of former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, \u201ctoo many unknown unknowns.\u201d Yet if Smollett did fabricate the attack, Levick says he needs to be more proactive.\n\u201cHe needs to get ahead of this as much as he can,\u201d he said. \u201cHe needs to go see the police. He needs to apologize. He needs to make the announcement about what happened instead of letting the facts leak out. If he lied, there\u2019s no excuse, but there may be some explanation.\u201d\n\u00a9 2019 Variety Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media; Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC"

            "Vadodara police on Saturday said that a class X student of a Vadodara school has confessed to killing a class IX student, whose body with 22 stab wounds was found in the school toilet on Friday. According to the police, the class X student did not know the victim, and he murdered him to bring disrepute to the school.\nThe prime accused, whose bag containing several sharp-edged weapons was found on a terrace adjacent to the school building, was detained from Valsad \u2014 nearly 200 km from Vadodara \u2014 and brought here for questioning on Saturday.\nBeing a juvenile, police were not directly involved in questioning the accused, and an NGO was roped in for it.\n\u201cThe accused had decided to defame the school and took the extreme step (of murdering the class IX student). He did not even know the name of the victim and showed no remorse or regret of what he had done,\u201d Assistant Commissioner of Police (Vadodara City) S G Patil said.\n\u201cA day before he committed the crime, the accused had not brought his homework and showed another classmate\u2019s homework to the teacher. On being scolded by the teacher, he misbehaved and entered into an altercation. The matter was then taken to the principal, where he misbehaved with the principal too. Other teachers also scolded him. He then decided to defame the school by killing a student,\u201d said Patil.\nAlso read | Class IX student found dead with 22 stab wounds in Vadodara school\n\u201cThough he is just 16 years old, but he is mature enough to have committed such a crime. We are going to seek court\u2019s nod to get him tried as an adult,\u201d Patil added.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to the police, the accused has a medical history of mental illness. He possibly acquired the sharp weapons from his father who owns a coconut water stall.\nA police source had said on Friday that in one of the CCTV footage recovered from the school, the 15-year-old victim and the suspect were seen \u201cwalking hand in hand from the ground floor to the first floor\u201d \u2014 the scene of the crime.\nThe 15-year-old victim, who stayed with his uncle in Vadodara city, had taken transfer to the school this year after completing his initial schooling from another school in the city. He had been to school just for a day before he was killed. \u201cHe had joined the school just day before yesterday, and did not talk about any friends or enemies or any kind of a fight at school,\u201d the boy\u2019s father, who runs a tea stall at a village in Anand district, told The Indian Express on Friday.\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, parents of the victim protested outside the school, demanding strict action against the school authorities for not providing enough security to the students. Police had to be deployed outside the school and in the locality where the accused lives to avoid any untoward incidents.\nGujarat State Commission for Protection of Child Rights chairperson Jagruti Pandya also reached the school to take stock of the situation. She called for adoption of stricter security measures by the schools to avoid a repeat of such incident. Pandya, later, met the family of the victim."

TradeWeb, Lyft and Pinterest have IPO'd so far, with each raising over $1 billion in fresh capital while allowing for existing investors to exit.\nChewy.com was acquired for $3.3 billion by private equity-owned PetSmart in 2017 as the brick-and-mortar retailer struggled to develop an online strategy. Somewhat controversially, PetSmart then spun-off 16.5% of the shares of Chewy.com to a separate entity raising the ire of bondholders.\nWhile pricing for the IPO has not been set, Chewy.com looks sure to attract a multi-billion dollar valuation. The valuation may be as high as $4.75 billion according to CNBC, which cited a report from S&P Global Ratings.\nIPOs have had a mixed record so far this year. Pinterest is up more than 70% from its IPO price of $19 while Lyft is down significantly, falling 18% from its IPO price of $72. Lyft-rival Uber is set to go public as early as May with a potential valuation of as much as $90 billion.\nChewy.com, which will trade under ticker CHWY, has also reported significant losses. The company reported a net loss of $268 million in 2018 on sales of $3.5 billion. The IPO will be underwritten by investment banks Allen & Company, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley."

            "PHOENIX -- Jordan Clarkson was one of many NBA players shocked and saddened by the news of rapper Nipsey Hussle being fatally shot outside his own Los Angeles clothing store on Sunday.\nstop killing Period! stop gun violence! \u2014 Jordan Clarkson (@JordanClarksons) April 1, 2019\nClarkson -- who has been more active on social media since the shooting and made the internet rounds for his emotional message about gun and gang violence at a Scottsdale nightclub late Sunday night -- said it feels like somebody took \u201cpart of my family.\u201d\n\u201cWe was on a bus and kind of all talking and stuff like that. It\u2019s crazy,\u201d Clarkson told cleveland.com Monday afternoon. \u201cI was like, \u2018Man, it felt like somebody took my family member from me.\u2019 That\u2019s what it felt like. This is a whole thing, man. It\u2019s just embarrassing to us. It\u2019s just crazy, man. Crazy stuff.\u201d\nThe 33-year-old Grammy-nominated West Coast rapper was known for his reality-based lyrics and work in the South Los Angeles community. He had developed an interest in technology and community development, and was part of a team of artists and entrepreneurs who developed Destination Crenshaw, an open-air museum devoted to honoring African-American artistic achievement.\nAccording to TMZ, Nipsey was supposed to be meeting with LAPD brass Monday to discuss ways of preventing gang violence.\n\u201cHe\u2019s so important to the culture and it\u2019s detrimental in terms of that,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cIn terms of everything, you have a black man that\u2019s doing good for himself no matter his past or whatever he had done. In his own neighborhood, started his own business, had his own thing going and he gets shot on a Sunday. It\u2019s almost embarrassing to our culture and to us as people that we would do something like that.\n\u201cIt does hurt because I feel like he has touched all of us in many ways. Then even people bringing their phones out and recording him while he\u2019s on the ground and stuff like that, it\u2019s a lot. We just have to change as people to be honest with you. I don\u2019t see no other races doing that. We definitely have to change as people. We just need to look in the mirror.\u201d\nClarkson said he only met the rapper, born Ermias Asghedom, a few times. Nipsey Hussle frequently sat courtside at Staples Center for Lakers home games. The two talked \u201chere and there\u201d and exchanged pleasantries on Twitter.\nBut the talented rapper still made a profound impact, which became more clear by the outpouring of messages and condolences.\n\u201cFeel like he\u2019s the 2Pac of our generation to be honest with you,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cSame impact. He has that much pull on people. You see how much in terms of people showing love.\u201d\nEarlier this year, Nipsey\u2019s long-awaited debut studio album, \u201cVictory Lap,\u201d earned a Grammy nod for best rap album. It featured lyrics about surviving street life, including fighting off would-be robbers. He collaborated with Kendrick Lamar, CeeLo Green, Diddy, The Dream and YG on that album.\nOne of the tracks, \u201cGrinding All My Life,\u201d was used in Isaiah Thomas\u2019 documentary titled \u201cBook Of Isaiah,\u201d while chronicled Thomas\u2019 trade from Boston and return from injury.\nClarkson\u2019s favorite track, \u201c7 Days a Week,\u201d came from Nipsey\u2019s \u201cThe Marathon\u201d mixtape. Earlier this season in Los Angeles, Clarkson got a tattoo on his lower leg of deceased rapper Pimp C. Asked if he will pay tribute to Nipsey Hussle with some ink the same way, Clarkson said \u201cI don\u2019t know yet. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\u201cHe was a real dude,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cHe always kept it honest. Even when he started his stuff to everything, he kept it real. Went back to his neighborhood and opened businesses and doing stuff for the community. That\u2019s why everybody feels like this. Man, took a good one away from everybody and from the culture, period.\"\nGet Cavs Insider texts in your phone from Chris Fedor: Cut through the clutter of social media and communicate directly with one of the NBA\u2019s best beat reporters -- just like you would with your friends.

            "Marvel\u2019s Iron Man VR is coming to PlayStation VR in 2019. The announcement was made Monday during Sony\u2019s inaugural State of Play streaming presentation.\nThe trailer for Iron Man VR mostly consists of a combat sequence that takes place in midair. Tony Stark\u2019s plane is ambushed by unknown forces. With the help of his digital assistant, FRIDAY, he leaps from the crippled vessel, dons the Iron Man suit, and goes into action. Players can clearly be seen using their hands to attack enemies with the Iron Man suit\u2019s iconic hand blasters. The trailer also includes cutscenes clearly labeled as \u201cnot actual gameplay.\u201d\nAccording to Marvel\u2019s own blog post on the announcement, Stark \u201cconfronts ghosts from his past \u2014 powerful forces who seek to ruin him and everything he stands for [alongside] iconic allies and Super Villains as they jet around the globe on a heroic mission to save not only Stark Industries, but the world itself.\u201d\nThis particular Iron Man suit is called the Impulse Armor, and is a brand-new design from illustrator Adi Granov. The Marvel post also includes an animation that appears to show some of the flight mechanics and maneuverability that the final game will offer players.\nThe game is in development by Camouflaj, and is a significant change in tack for the studio. Its previous title, R\u00e9publique, was successfully funded on Kickstarter in 2012. The third-person stealth adventure was originally released episodically, before recently being ported to VR.\nNo price point was given for the game. The release window is listed as 2019.\nUpdate: This article has been updated with additional details on Marvel\u2019s Iron Man VR from the official Marvel blog."

            "As Brigham Young University\u2019s mascot, Cosmo the Cougar, Charlie Bird was the face of athletics at the nation\u2019s largest Mormon university, but he was hiding a significant part of his identity \u2014 that he was gay.\n\u201cAs scary as it seemed to dance in front of 60,000 people, an even scarier thought often crept into my mind \u2014 \u2018If they knew who I really was, would they hate me?\u2019\u201d Bird wrote in a commentary piece published Tuesday in Salt Lake City\u2019s Deseret News, in which he came out.\nBird was a popular mascot for the Utah university from 2015 to 2018, especially in his senior year, when videos of his dance routines were viewed by hundreds of millions of people on social media. \u201cI performed live on ESPN at the College Football Awards, and NBC Sports dubbed 2017-2018 the \u2018Year of the Mascot\u2019 in honor of Cosmo\u2019s viral influence,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhen I was Cosmo, I felt invincible.\u201d\nBut given the need to hide his sexual orientation, he had different feelings out of costume. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (the formal name of the Mormon Church) is less than friendly toward LGBTQ people. It expects members to refrain from same-sex relationships, and as for transgender people, it considers gender fixed at birth and immutable. Bird often heard insensitive comments about LGBTQ people.\n\u201cThe same community that made me feel like a superstar often simultaneously made me feel broken, unloved and defective,\u201d he wrote.\nHe became involved with a group of students and administrators working to make BYU more inclusive. The group received permission to hold the first campus discussion on LGBTQ issues, and he has heard encouraging words from some Mormon leaders, including Elder M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.\n\u201cWhile I am grateful for the progress, I feel we \u2014 as a community, state and country \u2014 still have a long way to go,\u201d he continued. Specifically, he wrote, \u201cWe must recognize that members of the LGBTQ community are present and participating in both academic and religious discussions. We must learn that showing empathy and support is not a compromise of moral values. We must \u2018comfort those that stand in need of comfort.\u2019\u201d\nIt could be credibly argued that the LDS Church is not making progress but going backward, with a policy of denying baptism to most children of same-sex couples and with leaders saying LGBTQ activism comes from Satan. But these topics did not come up in his essay or in a follow-up interview with Salt Lake City\u2019s other daily, The Salt Lake Tribune, and Bird remains committed to working for change within the church. Since the essay was published, he has received \u201cmany, many, many\u201d messages of support from LGBTQ church members and families with LGBTQ children, he told the Tribune.\nWhile the piece in the Deseret News (which is owned by the LDS Church) marked his public coming-out, Bird had started opening up about being gay to certain friends and associates at BYU late in his senior year and \u201creceived nothing but love and support from coaches, teammates, and athletic administration,\u201d he noted to the Tribune.\n\u201cI have somehow been blessed with an amazing platform where I can make my voice heard,\u201d Bird, who now works for a consulting firm in New York City, added in the interview. \u201cI wanted to make sure I used that platform to give a voice to people who don\u2019t have that same opportunity, and share a very real story of what many people are going through.\u201d"

            "A man who spent 27 years in prison after he was wrongfully convicted of murder has been freed, thanks in no small part to a drawing of a golf course he made while incarcerated.\nValentino Dixon, 48, finally walked out of the maximum-security Attica Correctional Facility on September 19, having maintained his innocence for the 1991 murder of 17-year-old Torriano Jackson in Buffalo, New York.\nIn a remarkable turn of events, Dixon's case and subsequent overturning of his conviction came following a magazine profile of him that appeared in Golf Digest in May 2012.\nWhile in prison, Dixon rekindled his childhood passion for colored-pencil drawing, with one of the wardens taking note of his skill. In the article titled \"Drawings From Prison,\" Dixon described how the warden eventually brought him a photograph of the 12th hole at Augusta National and asked if he could draw it for him.\n\"I spent 15 hours on it,\" Dixon wrote. \"The warden loved it, and it was gratifying to know my art would hang in his house. Something about the grass and sky was rejuvenating. After 19 years in Attica (New York) Correctional Facility, the look of a golf hole spoke to me. It seemed peaceful.\"\nDixon completed about 130 different drawings of golf courses, despite never having played the game before in his life.\nDixon's talent was eventually brought to the attention of Golf Digest, which asked: \"Is Valentino Dixon innocent?\" in the article, which examined key witness statements and noted there was no physical evidence linking Dixon to the victim.\n\"It took about a hundred drawings before Golf Digest noticed, but when we did, we also noticed his conviction seemed flimsy,\" Max Adler, the magazine's editorial director, wrote in a follow-up story following confirmation of Dixon's release.\n\"The case is complicated, but on the surface it involves shoddy police work, zero physical evidence linking Dixon, conflicting testimony of unreliable witnesses\u2026 All together, a fairly clear instance of local officials hastily railroading a young black man.\"\nThe magazine's coverage prompted students at Georgetown University to pick up Dixon's case as part of their Prison Reform Project course last year.\nAmong the key details uncovered by the students\u2014Julie Fragonas, Isobella Goonetillake and Naoya Johnson\u2014was the revelation that prosecutors in the original case didn't reveal to Dixon's defense attorney that a test on Dixon's clothes for gunpowder had come back negative.\nMore shockingly, the man who did kill Jackson in 1991 even admitted it on camera just days after the murder.\n\"I don't want my friend to take the rap for something that I did,\" Lamarr Scott told WGRZ anchor Wanda Starke at the time.\nScott, who is serving 25 years in prison for an unrelated attempted murder, admitted to the killing again in court, saying he had got the murder weapon from Dixon.\n\"There was a fight. Shots were fired. I grabbed the gun from under the bench, switched it to automatic, all the bullets shot out. Unfortunately, Torriano ended up dying,\" Scott told the court, reported The Associated Press. \"I dropped the gun and ran and it was over and done with.\"\nJudge Susan Eagan said Dixon would have faced five to 15 years if convicted of criminal possession of a weapon and confirmed he was still eligible for release as that sentence had passed several years ago.\n\"So many times I've come close [to giving up], but God kept giving me the strength to keep on and now I know why,\" Dixon told Golf Digest after learning of his pending release.\nDixon's family also expressed gratitude for the Georgetown students' work in helping to overturn his conviction.\n\"If the opportunity comes that you can be a light to someone else, take it,\" said Dixon's daughter, Tina. \"You never know just how much of an impact you can make, and these Georgetown students have made a profound and lasting impact for my father and our family.\""

They have not only beaten and drawn with Liverpool over the last few days, it's how they have competed that's impressed me.\n\"They've had the confidence to play out against one of the best pressing teams in Europe, a radical change from the more pragmatic Antonio Conte.\"\nTelegraph\n\"This was Chelsea\u2019s biggest game of the season so far, an occasion Abramovich would normally be keen to take his seat for, particularly with his latest managerial appointment looking good and Hazard on fire,\"writes Matt Law for the Telegraph .\n\"It is exactly what Abramovich has always wanted, a team able and willing to imprint their style on any opposition and his very own Lionel Messi who can turn a game with a stroke of genius.\n\"He would have been gutted about Daniel Sturridge\u2019s spectacular late equaliser for Liverpool, but he would also be hugely encouraged by another good display.\n\"Abramovich has had plenty of successful teams and only time will tell whether or not head coach Maurizio Sarri can deliver trophies. But the Russian has dreamed of Chelsea being able to win in style and they might finally be on course to do that, just as he is no longer showing up to see it.\n\"Abramovich has never before been an absentee foreign owner, making it his business to keep a personal eye on what is happening on the pitch.\"\n(Image: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)\nThe Independent\n\"For all the late fireworks, Chelsea\u2019s draw with Liverpool was a game that did not have too much tangible effect on the early title race \u2013 but did maybe reveal a lot about one of the factors that will fire it,\" writes Miguel Delaney for the Independent .\n\"Mohamed Salah may have ended last season as the undisputed \u2013 and double \u2013 player of the season, but his display and wider form means he no longer looks like the best player in the division. That, at least while Belgian teammate Kevin De Bruyne is injured, is indisputably Eden Hazard.\n\"He only continued his sensational opening to the campaign, by so exquisitely completing the move for the opening goal in Saturday\u2019s draw. It was just more convincing proof of a star on form, lifting his side to his higher levels.\n\"As their main goal threat now, Hazard just gives Chelsea a proper end product that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be there; a penetration to passing moves that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be there.\n\"That goal was such compelling evidence. Having surged through after an exquisite combinative passing off the type Maurizio Sarri idealises, Hazard still just put the ball in pretty much the only place he could.\n\"He seems to be thriving, and moving up another level, in the way the manager seems to be encouraging his creativity.\"\n(Image: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)\nThe Guardian\n\"Twenty minutes after the final whistle, with the sky above the stands fading to a deep pinky-blue, the Liverpool fans were still singing. This was an excellent game with elements of cheer for both teams in a 1-1 draw \u2013 and indeed for Manchester City, too, who saw both their main title rivals gouge a piece out of each other at Stamford Bridge,\" writes Barney Ronay in the Guardian .\n\"For Liverpool\u2019s supporters, there was a little extra feeling in taking a well-deserved point through Daniel Sturridge\u2019s brilliant late equaliser. There are two elements to this. Most obviously, Liverpool drew at Chelsea despite Mo Salah seeming once again to have his gears misaligned, haring around the Stamford Bridge pitch like a soap box cart with a wonky wheel.\nWhat is certain is that Salah does look below his best level. This game had been billed, rightly or wrongly, as a head-to-head in the creative areas, a measure of Eden Hazard\u2019s current sublime form against the memory of Salah\u2019s brilliance last season.\n\"If this always seemed like a simplification, then Hazard was brilliant here all the same, confirming his status as the outstanding player in the league right now. Under Maurizio Sarri, Hazard has been asked to engage only the forward gears. This must be the right way to use him. Just give us the good stuff, as much as you\u2019ve got.\n\"Hazard it was who opened the scoring, spinning in the centre circle and firing the thrusters away from the left side of the Liverpool defence, feet battering the turf at extraordinary speed, like a drum roll before the finish.\n\"Mateo Kovacic found him with an expert through pass. As Alisson came out, Hazard found the far corner of the net with a lovely clipped finish.\n(Image: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images)\nKeep up to date with the latest news, features and exclusives from football.london via the free football.london app for iPhone and Android .\nAvailable to download from the App Store and Google Play ."

            "A successful jailbreak typically requires some sort of highly sophisticated plan to outwit the authorities and get around whatever high-security systems may be in your way. Or, alternately, all it takes is to get a few friends to fly a helicopter into the prison yard and then high-tail it out of there in broad daylight. That's the approach one notorious bank robber took this past weekend when he literally choppered his way out of a French prison, and amazingly enough, it wasn't even the first time he's managed to escape the big house by employing especially clever means.\nRedoine Faid, an infamous French gangster who was serving a 25-year sentence for a botched armed bank robbery that killed a police officer, made the daring escape on Sunday morning after a trio of armed accomplices hijacked a helicopter, landed it in the yard of the Sud-Francilien prison outside Paris, and burst into the building to grab him. The whole operation went down in a matter of minutes, and all while Faid was in a special visitor's area of the jail chatting with his brother who'd come to see him. As of this writing, they're all still on the lam, and there's a massive manhunt underway to catch everyone involved.\nTo pull the whole thing off, the heavily armed accomplices reportedly hijacked a helicopter from an airfield near the prison and forced a flying instructor waiting for a student to assist them. They then landed it in one of the jail's courtyard's, grabbed Faid at gunpoint, and fled to an area nearby where they torched the chopper and hopped into a getaway car. Eventually, they hopped into a different getaway vehicle (torching the first one), and have since evaded authorities. The helicopter pilot was released unharmed, though he did have to go to the hospital to be treated for shock.\nIn the wake of the incident, French Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet traveled to the prison, and described the escape as \"spectacular.\" Interestingly, the courtyards and open-air areas of French prisons are almost all protected with netting to prevent this exact sort of thing from happening after a spate of similar helicopter escapes in the late 2000s. However, there wasn't one installed in this particular one because it was reportedly only used by inmates when they were being admitted or released from the facility."

He did not directly answer whether sanctions to punish Russia for seizing the Ukrainian peninsula would remain in place in perpetuity.\nInstead, Mr. Pompeo repeatedly restated United States policy, saying that after the Helsinki summit meeting, the stance on sanctions \u201cremains completely unchanged,\u201d and that \u201cno commitment has been made to change those policies.\u201d But he did not speak to whether Mr. Trump had signaled any willingness to reconsider or modify them.\nMr. Menendez told Mr. Pompeo that American citizens and their elected officials have heard more about what happened in the closed-door Helsinki meeting from Moscow than from their own president.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what the truth is because nobody else was in the room where it happened,\u201d Mr. Menendez said.\nOn the election interference in particular, Mr. Pompeo told the committee that the president accepts the findings that the Russian cyberattacks took place and that he \u201chas a complete and proper understanding of what happened.\u201d"

The 59-year old Sunseri was Florida\u2019s defensive line coach last season after three years as the Oakland Raiders' linebackers coach.

Alabama ultimately hired Craig Kuligowski away from Miami.\nSunseri\u2019s son, Vinnie, recently accepted a graduate assistant spot on the staff at Alabama.\nIan Fitzsimmons of ESPN Radio first reported about the hiring of Flood.

            "The electricity and gas company FortisBC is asking British Columbians to turn down their thermostats and reduce natural gas use on other appliances following Tuesday's gas line explosion near Prince George.\nPuget Sound Energy and Cascade Natural Gas, both U.S. energy companies, are also asking customers in Washington state to help conserve natural gas and electricity because of B.C.'s pipeline rupture and the impact it has on the U.S. gas supply.\nIn an updated statement issued on Wednesday afternoon, FortisBC said there had so far been a reduction in natural gas use of about 20 per cent provincewide, but that further cuts are needed.\n\"We still need more customers to reduce their natural gas usage as much as possible for now, as we continue to work with Enbridge and confirm the impact on the system,\" it read in part.\n\"We recognize that in some parts of B.C. it may be impractical to turn off thermostats due to cold weather. Even turning the temperature down as much as possible and reducing hot water use and other natural gas usage will help.\"\nThe Enbridge natural gas pipeline that exploded Tuesday evening is a feeder for the provincewide gas distribution system\nAlthough the fire on the pipeline has been extinguished, two Enbridge pipelines were shut off: the ruptured pipe and another one that's to be assessed for damage.\nLate Wednesday night, FortisBC said Enbridge was given NEB approval to restart the pipeline that was not damaged by the explosion.\nHowever, they said customers should still expect a constrained supply of natural gas.\nFIRE near Salmon Valley Prince George pic.twitter.com/bUnxWcyWlK \u2014@rockybeach67\n\"About 70 per cent of customers could be impacted here,\" said Douglas Stout, vice-president of external relations with FortisBC.\nThe company serves just over a million customers across the province, from the Lower Mainland to Northern B.C.\nCombined, the two pipes supply 85 per cent of all natural gas used provincewide.\nAlthough the fire on the pipeline has been extinguished, two Enbridge pipelines are being shut off: the ruptured pipe and another one that's to be assessed for damage. (Andrew Kurjata/CBC)\n'Turn your thermostats down'\n\"Anybody who consumes natural gas, we're asking you to cut back to as little as possible and help us work through this situation to everybody's benefit,\" Stout said.\n\"Turn your thermostats down as low as possible, obviously that depends on the region you're in what you can do, minimize the use of hot water if you've got a gas water heater, turn off your fireplace.\"\nDue to a pipeline rupture Tuesday in B.C., Canada, we\u2019re asking for your help conserving natural gas and electricity today. Lowering your thermostat and limiting hot water use can make a difference. Our local gas system is safe and was not damaged by the pipeline failure. \u2014@PSETalk\nThe pipeline is part of the T-South system, stretching over 1,000 kilometres from Chetwynd, B.C., to the U.S. border, which is why it impacts gas distribution across the province and into Washington.\nFortisBC has also asked industrial customers to use alternative fuel sources. Stout said that those who have the ability to do so have switched off their natural gas use for now.\nCanfor, a pulp mill in Prince George, has shut down two of its sawmills due to a lack of gas.\nThe pipeline is part of the T-South system, which stretches over 1,000 kilometres from Chetwynd to the B.C.-US border, passing through several communities. (Enbridge )\nNo injuries in explosion\nThe line ruptured on Lheidli T'enneh reserve land and witnesses who saw the explosion described it as an incandescent orange fireball that could be seen for kilometres.\nNo one was injured but roughly 100 people fled their homes, including Chief Dominic Frederick.\nBig fire north of #Princegeorge. Smoke up to 10k feet. pic.twitter.com/mdbgjbnzvd \u2014@gregnoel\nHe wants answers but says he doesn't expect his nation's relationship with the company to change as a result.\n\"We're not going to move away because of one explosion,\" Frederick said.\n\"We've lived there for most of our lives, since the pipelines were built, and we never had any concerns with the pipeline until now.\"\nInvestigation underway\nThe Transportation Safety Board is responsible for the investigation into the incident and the National Energy Board has sent four specialists to the scene.\nThe B.C. Oil and Gas Commission and the B.C. Ministry of Environment, among others, are also looking into the incident.\n\"A cause will be determined following an investigation of this event,\" said Enbridge spokesperson Michael Barnes. .\n\"Safety is always our top focus and top priority.\"\nThe company is working with nearby communities to maintain public safety, he said, but he cannot speculate about how long it will take to resolve the situation.\n#NEB inspectors have been deployed to the area to monitor and oversee the company\u2019s response and to determine the impact and extent of the release. No injuries have been reported. More information to be provided as available. \u2014@NEBCanada\n\"The most significant impact right now is what we are doing in terms of precautions,\" said B.C. Minister of Energy Michelle Mungall.\n\"We don't know what caused this explosion yet but once we do know, no doubt there will be some lessons to be learned and we will be implementing those as regulators.\"\nWith files from Yvette Brend, Andrew Kurjata and The Early Edition."

(Video: Reuters)\nComment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Tuesday scheduled a pair of competing votes to reopen the federal government, announcing that he would bring up dueling proposals from President Trump and the Democrats that would amount to the first real action in the Senate since the shutdown began a month ago.\nNeither measure looked likely to win the support from 60 senators needed to advance, and instead the votes Thursday threatened to accomplish little more than to provide each side with new ammunition to accuse the other of prolonging the nation\u2019s longest government shutdown. The result could be only to prove that some other solution is needed to end the partial shutdown, even as 800,000 federal workers face the loss of a second straight paycheck Friday.\nTrump\u2019s proposal, which the president announced in a weekend speech from the White House, would open the government through Sept. 30 while providing $5.7 billion for a border wall and giving temporary deportation protections to about 1 million unauthorized immigrants. But it also contains stringent changes to the nation\u2019s asylum rules, and Democrats who were already united against funding Trump\u2019s wall described these asylum provisions Tuesday as a new poison pill.\nThe Democrats\u2019 plan is a stopgap spending bill that would fund the government through Feb. 8 without providing any new money for the wall. That would let both parties negotiate on border security while the government is reopened, a respite Democrats have been demanding.\nAdvertisement\nBut the White House has consistently opposed reopening the government without getting wall money. And most Republicans have fallen in line with that stance, even though the Senate passed nearly identical legislation shortly before the shutdown began. At the time, many believed that Trump would support the proposal, only to see him publicly oppose it the next day.\nThursday\u2019s planned votes are a product of an agreement between McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). But even as the leaders announced the deal, they traded barbs in speeches on the Senate floor. McConnell accused Democrats of rejecting a reasonable proposal from Trump because of political opposition to the president, and Schumer argued that Republicans and Trump were operating in bad faith by including new asylum curbs and failing to consult with Democrats.\n\u201cOn one side of the scale we have all of my Democratic colleagues\u2019 declarations that we must reopen the rest of the federal government and get federal workers their paychecks . . . And we have their stated desire to help out a number of individuals with a more certain immigration status,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThat\u2019s one side of the scale. All that\u2019s on the other side is the far left\u2019s political animus for the occupant of the White House. It is high time to get serious.\u201d\nMembers of Congress discussed ways to break the funding impasse on Jan. 20, the 30th day of a partial government shutdown. (Video: Patrick Martin/The Washington Post)\nAdvertisement\nSchumer disputed McConnell\u2019s remarks.\n\u201cNow the president said his proposal was a reasonable compromise. In fact it is neither reasonable nor a compromise,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cThere was no serious negotiation with any Democrat about what went into the proposal. That\u2019s because the proposal was never intended to pass. It\u2019s only a thinly veiled attempt by the president to save face.\u201d\nThe acrimony on display on the Senate floor came as warnings intensified about the shutdown\u2019s economic consequences, and federal agencies such as the Transportation Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service struggled to conduct their basic duties.\nSome employees who are not getting paid but are supposed to report to work anyway because their duties have been deemed essential chose to stay home. Lawmakers from Virginia and Maryland, with large concentrations of federal workers, issued increasingly desperate calls for the shutdown to be over with \u2014 and yet there was still no end in sight.\nAdvertisement\nHoping to entice some Democrats to support his new proposal, Trump offered a three-year pause in his efforts to scrap rules that shield some immigrants from deportation. The rules are a Democratic priority, as they protect the \u201cdreamers,\u201d a group that includes 700,000 young people brought illegally to the United States as children, who won temporary deportation protections under the Obama-era program formally known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).\nBut Democrats accused Trump of offering a short-term solution to a problem he himself caused, and the Supreme Court on Tuesday weakened Trump\u2019s hand, taking no action to review lower-court rulings that had blocked Trump from ending DACA. If the court sticks to its normal procedures, even accepting the case at a later date would probably mean the justices would not hear arguments until the court\u2019s new term starts in October. That would probably keep the program in place until at least next year.\nWith the court seemingly keeping the program safe for at least a year, Trump\u2019s offer to suspend his efforts to end it became less appealing to lawmakers who were already skeptical.\nAdvertisement\nDemocratic opposition to Trump\u2019s proposal further solidified Tuesday as Democratic lawmakers and immigration activists dug into the Senate legislation and discovered that it contains dramatic new limits on the U.S. asylum program.\nThe legislation specifies that children younger than 18 from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala could not apply for asylum at the U.S. border and instead would be turned away, because of a new requirement that they apply from their home countries. The law would also set a new cap of 15,000 on the number of children who could qualify each year for the asylum program.\nAdditionally, the legislation says children could qualify for asylum only if they had a U.S.-based guardian to care for them. Immigration experts said the changes would effectively bar Central American minors arriving at U.S. borders from access to asylum.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s an enormous restriction,\u201d said Greg Chen, director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cIt pretty much shuts down access to asylum for Central American minors arriving at U.S. borders and will force thousands of children back into life-threatening danger.\u201d\nA spokesman for McConnell\u2019s office directed questions about the proposed asylum changes to the administration. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment.\nMeanwhile, House Democrats announced fresh plans to pass legislation this week that would reopen the government while blocking new wall funding, but Trump has repeatedly rejected similar bills, and McConnell has said the Senate won\u2019t take them up \u2014 leading Republicans, newly consigned to powerlessness in the House minority, to question why they were engaging in the exercise at all.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cDoing the same thing over and over is not likely to get us there,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole \u00ad(R-Okla.).\nThe impasse has left key parts of the federal government unfunded for more than a month, including the Treasury, Homeland Security, Interior, Agriculture and Justice departments. It has also threatened important government services, leaving the White House to repeatedly attempt to find ways to keep unfunded parts of the government functioning.\nBut Trump and his chief negotiating rival, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), both promised Tuesday morning that they would not give in.\nIn a morning post on Twitter, the president accused Democrats of playing \u201cpolitical games,\u201d exclaimed \u201cNo Cave!\u201d and argued that construction of a wall along the Mexican border would lead to substantially lower crime rates and fewer drugs coming into the United States.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWithout a Wall our Country can never have Border or National Security,\u201d Trump wrote.\nIn response, Pelosi accused Trump and McConnell of \u201cholding Americans hostage\u201d by not acting on the House bills.\nIn a statement later in the day, she added: \u201cSenate Republicans need to re-open government, not continue their complicity in the Trump Shutdown with a vote for the President\u2019s unacceptable border and immigration schemes that only increase the chaos and suffering at the border.\u201d\nThe Senate bill incorporates a few elements aimed at winning Democratic support, including some new humanitarian aid, $12.7 billion in hurricane and wildfire disaster relief, and the three-year protections for about 700,000 dreamers, as well as 300,000 immigrants who came to the United States following natural disasters or other calamities in their home countries and who won \u201ctemporary protected status,\u201d a designation Trump is also moving to phase out.\nAdvertisement\nIn announcing his proposal in the White House speech Saturday, Trump touted it as a \u201ccommon-sense compromise both parties should embrace.\u201d\n\u201cOur plan includes critical measures to protect migrant children from exploitation and abuse,\u201d Trump said, in a mention of the new asylum provisions. \u201cThis includes a new system to allow Central American minors to apply for asylum in their home countries, and reform to promote family reunification for unaccompanied children, thousands of whom wind up on our border doorstep.\u201d\nBut the changes cracking down on asylum seekers and other pieces of the immigration system drew angry and widespread condemnation from immigration activists.\nWendy Young, president of Kids in Need of Defense, a group that works with unaccompanied immigrant youths, said that under the proposed changes, \u201ckids will lose their lives, plain and simple.\u201d\nThe legislation would also double fees for young immigrants to apply for protection under DACA and create new income requirements to qualify, in effect preventing very poor immigrants from being able to apply, according to United We Dream, a group that supports dreamers.\nAnd it would increase by 20 percent the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency\u2019s budget for detention and enforcement, said Heidi Altman, director of policy at the National Immigrant Justice Center. This money could fund an additional 2,000 new ICE officers and 750 new border agents.\nBut the legislation also faces opposition from some on the right, including conservative commentator Ann Coulter, who has described it as \u201camnesty.\u201d\nAnd some immigration restrictionists said they would like to see the legislation go even farther. For example, the proposal would allow the administration to tighten the process that allows asylum seekers to claim they have a \u201ccredible fear\u201d of persecution in their home countries, said Chris Chmielenski, a spokesman for NumbersUSA, an advocacy firm that favors tighter immigration rules.\nBut NumbersUSA wants those changes to be made permanent in the Senate GOP proposal, along with changes that would allow the Department of Homeland Security to deport unaccompanied minors not from Canada or Mexico back to their home countries.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t go far enough,\u201d Chmielenski said.\nRobert Barnes contributed to this report.\nGiftOutline Gift Article"

            "SOUTH GLENS FALLS, NY --Within hours of a devastating fire that heavily damaged a Glens Falls-area craft brewery, fellow brewers from across Upstate New York rallied to offer help, support and assistance.\nThe late Monday fire gutted a large portion of the brewhouse at Common Roots Brewing, a 5-year-old brewery and tap room in South Glens Falls. The fire appears to have be accidental, but remains under investigation, according to a report in the Glens Falls Post-Star. Customers were in the tap room at the time, but no one was hurt, the Post-Star reported.\nThe brewery, owned by the father-son team of Bert and Christian Weber, posted this note on Facebook Monday night:\n\u201cEarlier this evening, a fire broke out at our brewery and taproom in South Glens Falls. While this is a very difficult time, we are grateful everyone got out safely. We appreciate the efforts of our local first responders and thank each of you for your thoughts and support. An additional update will be provided at the appropriate time.\u201d\nThat was almost immediately followed by offers of help from the tight-knit Upstate New York craft brewing community.\n\u201cThoughts are with you. Gonna pull the brew community together and lend a hand to you guys,\" wrote Kurt Borchardt, co-owner of Artisanal Brew Works in Saratoga Springs.\n\u201cBinghamton Brewing Co. is here to support in any way we can. We are so sorry for your loss and grateful everyone is ok,\u201d wrote the Binghamton brewery\u2019s co-owner, Kristen Lyons.\nWhile it\u2019s too early to tell exactly what help Common Roots might need, the breweries are ready, said Paul Leone, director of the New York State Brewers Association.\n\u201cThis just happened last night, and my inbox is already full with messages of \u2018What can we do?\u2019 'What do they need?\u201d Leone said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to rally the brewers -- they were rallied already.\u201d\nHelp could come in the form of equipment, brewing space or even having fellow brewers make some Common Roots styles to keep them in circulation while the Webers rebuild. Brewers could also offer proceeds from the sale of beers to benefit Common Roots.\nThere is precedent for that: When Superstorm Sandy battered the Barrier Brewing Co. on Long Island in 2012, Brewery Ommegang near Cooperstown made a beer called Barrier Relief as a fundraiser for the rebuilding effort.\nMore recently, brewers across the country, including a dozen or so in Upstate New York, joined with Sierra Nevada Brewing of Chico, Calif. to make version of a beer called Resilience. Proceeds from the sale of those beers aided victims of last year\u2019s northern California forest fires, one of which threatened the Sierra Nevada brewery.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been talk of a Resilience-type effort, but we have nothing solid yet,\u201d Leone said.\nIn its five years, Common Roots has made a name for itself with a range of beers, from pale ales, IPAs, and double IPAs to coffee stouts, sours and barrel-aged brews.\nThe fire broke out not long after Christian Weber had started a new batch, the Post-Star reported. The brewery is insured, the report said.\nThe brewery had also just launched an expansion project, hoping to \u201cadd more taproom and retail space, a private bar, an outdoor deck, and a kitchen,\u201d according to a recent Common Roots Facebook post. Construction was supposed to begin this summer.\nThe brewery is in South Glens Falls, a Saratoga County community adjacent to the city of Glens Falls, which is in Warren County.\nDon Cazentre writes about craft beer, wine, spirits and beverages for NYup.com, syracuse.com and The Post-Standard.

The two English Premier League sides will compete in the FA Cup Semi-Final, where both teams will look to advance to the competition\u2019s final.\nManchester City have already won the EFL \u201cCarabao\u201d Cup this season, and the Sky Blues will look to add to their trophy cabinet. City manager Pep Guardiola found himself at this stage of the competition two years ago, albeit his side were eliminated by Arsenal in extra time. Guardiola and his men will believe they have learned from this mistake as they prepare for this fixture on Saturday.\nIt will be no easy match, however, as Brighton & Hove Albion are also celebrating their success in this season\u2019s competition. Brighton\u2019s last appearance in the Semi-Finals came in the mid-1980s, and having been on a hiatus for over thirty years, the Seagulls will look to give it their all in this match.\nTeam News:\nManchester City are without the injured Oleksandr Zinchenko and Fabian Delph. Sergio Ag\u00fcero will travel with the team, although it is unlikely he will start in this match.\nBrighton & Hove Albion\u2019s Solly March, Jason Steele and Pascal Gro\u00df are sidelined through injury.\nPossible Lineups:\nManchester City\nFormation: 4-3-3\nEderson; Walker, Stones, Laporte, Danilo; De Bruyne, Fernandinho, D.

Having advanced due to a fortunate turn of events, the Sky Blues will give it their all as they hope to advance to a second cup final this season.\nMeanwhile, Brighton & Hove Albion will look to play spoiler as they embark on their journey to win silverware this season. The Seagulls avoided their own upset as they defeated Millwall on penalties, but they will face a more difficult test in London on Saturday.\nGiven their current forms, City will be heavy favourites. But anything is possible in a cup competition, and it is expected the Seagulls will give the Sky Blues a run on Saturday. City will do just enough to edge out the tie, but not without facing a stubborn Brighton side.\nManchester City 3-2 Brighton & Hove Albion"

            "Authorities in southern Louisiana on Wednesday arrested a suspect in a spate of fires that have burned three black churches in St. Landry Parish since last month, according to federal prosecutors.\n\"A suspect has been identified in connection with the three church burnings in Opelousas, Louisiana, and is in state custody,\" said U.S. Attorney David C. Joseph in a statement. \"The U.S. Attorney's Office, ATF, and FBI are working with state and local law enforcement and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the victims and those St. Landry Parish residents affected by these despicable acts.\"\nThe Louisiana State Fire Marshal's Office, which has led the investigation into the blazes, declined to comment on the arrest. Multiple local media outlets in Louisiana have identified the suspect as a 21-year-old man who is the son of a St. Landry Parish deputy. Authorities plan to release more information on Thursday morning.\nLocal leaders praised the arrest for bringing an end to several frightening weeks for residents as hundreds of investigators worked with federal authorities to determine who had ignited the fires.\n\"I'm very proud of the investigative effort that has lead to this arrest. I'm prayerful that we can close this horrific chapter and begin to heal,\" Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., said in a statement sent to KATC.\nWhen Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas, Louisiana, caught fire on April 4, consuming the church's interior, it was the third predominantly black church to burn down in St. Landry Parish in the span of 10 days, setting local residents on edge. On March 26, flames reduced St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre to just a few walls and piles of rubble. And on April 2, a blaze struck the Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas.\nAuthorities still have not determined a motive and have declined to tell residents whether they believe race was a factor in the crimes, according to The Advocate. On Sunday, State Fire Marshal H. \"Butch\" Browning told worshipers at Mount Pleasant that about 200 state investigators were working the case alongside officials from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the FBI.\n\"There is clearly something happening in this community,\" Browning said in a statement last week. \"That's why it's imperative that the citizens of this community be part of our effort to figure out what it is.\"\nA fourth fire on March 31 was reported more than 200 miles away at the predominantly white Vivian United Pentecostal Church in Caddo Parish, Louisiana, but authorities have not established a link to the St. Landry incidents.\nFor some, the recent fires recall a dark history of attacks and threats against black churches in the South. During Reconstruction and the civil rights movement, black churches were targeted with fires, bombings and threats.\nIn 2015, a white-supremacist gunman opened fire on a prayer group at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, killing nine black people. Nearly 200 years before, Emanuel AME's predecessor had been burned down in 1822 by Charleston's white leaders, who feared an insurrection by the city's enslaved residents.\nAn African-American man in Mississippi pleaded guilty to arson last month for setting fire to a black church in 2016. He had attempted to disguise the arson as a hate crime.\nAs authorities investigated the St. Landry fires, churches' leaders were resilient, though baffled by the attacks.\n\"My church has a lot of history,\" the Rev. Gerald Toussaint of Mount Pleasant Baptist Church told The Daily Advertiser, noting that it was more than 140 years old. \"I don't understand it. What could make a person do that to a church?\"\nGreater Union had served worshipers for more than 100 years, according to Pastor Harry Richard, whose grandfather helped found the church.\n\"He left a legacy for me and I was trying to fulfill that to the best of my ability,\" he told CBS News.\nToussaint told ABC News that \"the church is not that building. The church is the people.\"\n\u201cIf we stay together as a congregation, the church is alive and well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can rebuild the building as long as we stay together.\u201d"

            "Moving air \u2014 that\u2019s the through line across most of Dyson\u2019s products. The vacuums, fans, hand dryers, hair driers \u2014 at their heart, they all the do the same thing. Same goes for the new Dyson Airwrap, which has figured out a way to leverage vacuum power into hair curling.\nHere\u2019s how Dyson describes it,\nAt the heart of this story comes a radical idea: harness Dyson\u2019s digital motor to create a phenomenon known as the Coanda effect. The Coanda effect occurs when a high-speed jet of air flows across a surface and, due to differences in pressure, the air flow attaches itself to the surface. Taking advantage of this principle, Dyson\u2019s team of aerodynamicists created a way to style hair using only air combined with heat.\nThat\u2019s engineering talk for a device that shoots air through a half dozen holes, wrapping hair around the cylinder. Then, like a standard curling iron, it uses heat like a standard curling iron \u2014 though this one is much less hot than cheaper models, potentially saving your hair (and skin) in the process.\nAll of which is to say it\u2019s not this:\nDyson says it spent six years researching/testing the product, which seems to be on-par with the company\u2019s high engineering standards. No surprise then that the Airwrap isn\u2019t cheap. The kit starts at $500, with the \u201ccomplete\u201d version running $550 for multiple hair types."

Officers discovered damage to two other sites and received a further report later on Thursday morning, all from places of worship within a few miles of each other and in an area with a large Muslim community.\n\u201cThe motive behind the attacks, which are being treated as linked, is yet to be established, but West Midlands Police and the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit are investigating,\u201d the statement said.\nBirmingham is one of Britain\u2019s largest cities and home to one of its biggest Muslim communities: More than one in five people there have declared Islam as their religion."

There\u2019s also group FaceTime and improved phone performance.\nAs always with the public beta, we warn you not to download it on your main device. Save it for a tester phone or iPad. If you really do want to play around on the only phone you own, make sure you back up all your data in case iOS 12 completely derails everything. The final version of the OS should be out later this fall after Apple\u2019s annual iPhone event."

He was often seen as close to the Saudi government and counted on to champion its policies and ignore its scandals and abuses. At times, he served as both an official and unofficial adviser to senior Saudi officials.\nBut last year, as many of his friends were arrested and the already limited margins of freedom of expression inside the kingdom shrank, Mr. Khashoggi went into voluntary exile, dividing his time between the Washington, D.C., area, London and Istanbul and publishing articles that criticized the increasingly authoritarian rule of Crown Prince Mohammed. He frequently wrote op-ed columns for The Washington Post.\nThose articles turned him into a pariah with the Saudi government and the defenders of Crown Prince Mohammed, who accused him of receiving cash from foreign governments to tarnish the kingdom\u2019s reputation.\nMr. Khashoggi\u2019s wife had remained in Saudi Arabia while he was no longer able to return freely. Their separation had led to a divorce, and he wanted to remarry to a Turkish woman."

(AP)\nEdelman taped an interview with Ellen Degeneres on \u201cThe Ellen Show\u201d that aired on Friday. She of course brought up his beard and how long he planned to keep it. Edelman said he wasn\u2019t sure \u2014 the king of T-shirts, Edelman has been selling ones with \u201cMVP\u201d carved into into his beard on his website \u2014 and that he was \u201cfeeling it out.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s grown on me,\u201d he joked.\nDegeneres made Edelman an offer: I\u2019ll donate $10,000 to the Boys & Girls Clubs of Boston if you let me shave the beard right now.\nEdelman took her up on the offer, and said he\u2019d match the $10,000.\nThrough the miracle of television, there was already a barber\u2019s chair, cape with the Patriots\u2019 logo and clippers waiting to be rolled out in front of the audience.\n\u2018I love you, beard\u2019\nAs Degeneres raises the clippers toward his face (after comically making her hand shake), Edelman said, \u201cWait, wait.\u201d\nShe asked if he wanted to say goodbye to his facial hair, and Edelman said, \u201cI love you, beard. It\u2019s been a hell of a year.\u201d\nOnce Degeneres was done, Edelman looked quite different, and the crowd screamed its appreciation.\n\u2018This was for my other team, my family\u2019\nBefore the big shave, Edelman said that winning the Super Bowl \u2014 he brought the gleaming Lombardi Trophy with him \u2014 is what\u2019s most important, but the MVP recognition gave him something personally as well.\n\u201cGetting the MVP is kind of a win for me and my other team, and that\u2019s my family.

And my mother, being the loving little lady that she is, I was never late to a practice, she was always there. \u2026 I mean, I had a bag lunch until junior college. She took care of me for a long time.

She then called law enforcement when he wouldn't obey.\nThe sixth-grader was arrested and taken to a juvenile detention centre, and has been charged with disrupting a school function and resisting arrest without violence, and suspended from school for three days.\nThe teacher reportedly claimed the boy threatened to get her fired, which he denied.\n\"I'm upset, I'm angry, I'm hurt,\" the boy's mother Dhakira Talbot told Bay News 9.\n\"My son has never been through anything like this. I feel like this should've been handled differently. If any disciplinary action should've been taken, it should've been with the school. He shouldn't have been arrested.\"\nThe 11-year-old reportedly never stands for the Pledge of Allegiance, in which US citizens \"pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all\".\nThe schools told media students aren't actually required to stand for the pledge, but the substitute teacher wasn't aware of this.\nMs Talbot said the teacher was \"way out of place\".\nThe department which looks after schools in the county said the teacher won't be hired for any more substitute jobs.\nRefusal to stand for patriotic songs and events has become an increasingly common form of protest in the US in recent years, a trend arguably started by former NFL star Colin Kaepernick.\nNewshub."

But of course I'm not going to judge. It's so unfair to judge Ole because he's won five games or lost five games.\n\"It's not fair to judge in both ways and it's not fair to judge Mourinho's job. Mourinho is one of the best managers in the world. For different reasons that I don't know, cannot perceive, his relationship stopped with the club.\n\"Of course for me only I am focused on trying to win the game on Sunday.

            "Could this be the end of situational relievers?\nMajor League Baseball made a proposal on Jan. 14 suggesting a rule requiring pitchers to face a minimum of three batters, sources told The Athletic.\nThe Athletic also reported the Players Association made a counterproposal, addressing concerns the players have about service-time manipulation and competitive integrity.\nSources also told the website that one of the changes the union proposed is a lowering of the team\u2019s draft position for failing to reach a specific win total in a certain number of seasons. The Players Association also reiterated a long-time request, proposing that the designated hitter be implemented in the National league, too. That move likely would increase offense, but could meet resistance from NL owners, who may not be enthusiastic about paying more for an extra offensive bat.\nThe proposal from the two sides for different ways to improve the game is likely just the beginning with more ideas and trade-offs expected to be discussed in the coming weeks, according to the report.\nIf no deal is reached, however, commissioner Rob Manfred still can make some pace-of play changes.\nThe collective bargaining agreement empowers the commissioner to unilaterally implement three elements he formally proposed last year, according to sources \u2014 a 20-second pitch clock, a reduction of mound visits from six to five and a rule placing a base runner on second base in spring training games and the All-Star Game when the score is tied after the 10th inning.\nThe current proposal by MLB includes a slight tweak from the above provisions, reducing mound visits from six to four in 2019 and four to three in 2020. It also includes an expansion of rosters from 25 to 26 in 2020, with an accompanying reduction from 40 to 28 in September.\nAccording to a previous report by the Associated Press, baseball also has proposed increasing the minimum time a player spends on the disabled list and amount of time an optioned player spends in the minor leagues from 10 to 15 days.\nIf the three-batter minimum rule is approved, it likely would increase the importance of the starting pitcher and also could limit the number of openers \u2014 relievers starting games."

            "No matter what Nate Diaz says about UFC 229\u2019s massive main event, the \u201cStockton Slapper\u201d will be watching closely tomorrow night (Sat., Oct. 6, 2018) when Conor McGregor makes his Octagon return against undefeated lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov.\nCurrently scheduled to fight streaking contender Dustin Poirier at UFC 230 on Nov. 3 from New York City, Diaz presumably has the inside track at the winner of McGregor vs. Khabib should he get past \u201cDiamond\u201d next month. It\u2019s a great position to be in for a fighter who hasn\u2019t competed since UFC 202 two years ago, but Diaz feels like he should be the one calling all the shots.\n\u201cI already told you about those guys, I slapped the shit out of both of them,\u201d Diaz told TMZ Sports (shown above). \u201cThey need to quit acting like them motherf*ckers are running shit. There\u2019s one king in this motherf*cker and he\u2019s right here.\u201d\nDiaz went a little deeper and gave his outlook on McGregor vs. Khabib.\n\u201cI think Conor\u2019s got a way better fighting style,\u201d he said. \u201cKhabib\u2019s scared for his life, so I don\u2019t know how good he\u2019s going to do with that. He might get scared and hold on for his life. I hope that\u2019s not happening for the sake of fighting. We don\u2019t need two boring ass champions.\u201d\nWhen asked who he would like to see win UFC 229\u2019s main event, Diaz revealed he wants both fighters to knock each other out. With that unlikely to happen, the UFC veteran is leaning towards whichever fighter shows up to scrap.\n\u201cI ain\u2019t pulling for nobody,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cDouble knockout as far as I\u2019m concerned. But let\u2019s get something. Let\u2019s get a fight. No bitch-ass hold on for your life, \u2018I work so hard\u2019\u2026 That boy [Nurmagomedov] ain\u2019t fought nobody. He went and grabbed on for his life against everybody. He fights like a scared little bitch. I\u2019m going for the fighters in this one.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going for anyone, but as far as fighting style, I got for the fighters usually.\u201d\nWith McGregor recently expressing interest in a trilogy bout with Diaz, who has split two previous Octagon meetings with \u201cNotorious,\u201d Diaz should want the Irishman to pull out the win at UFC 229. A trilogy bout between the two would likely produce better PPV numbers than McGregor vs. Khabib and close out one of the biggest rivalries in MMA history.\nSurprisingly, Diaz isn\u2019t that interested in a third bout with McGregor.\n\u201cI ain\u2019t fighting no trilogy,\u201d he said. \u201cHe already got his ass whipped. He can fight everybody else, I got shit to do too.\u201d\nDiaz also confirmed that he has limited interest in a showdown with Khabib.\n\u201cI don\u2019t wanna fight no boring ass fighter,\u201d he said. \u201cI already slapped the guy on the street and that motherf*cker didn\u2019t do shit. And then he tried to roll up with his boys and I slapped all those motherfuckers too. Pussies.\u201d\nWhile Diaz has always been the type of fighter to march to the beat of his own drum, it\u2019s highly unlikely that the lightweight fan favorite would bypass a lucrative grudge match with McGregor or a title fight opposite Khabib. Either fight makes sense for Diaz if he\u2019s able to defeat Poirier at UFC 230.\nWe\u2019ll have to wait and see who comes out on top at UFC 229 and if Diaz changes his tune post-fight.\nMMAmania.com will deliver LIVE round-by-round, blow-by-blow coverage of the entire UFC 229 fight card on fight night (click here), starting with the Fight Pass \u201cPrelims\u201d matches online, which are scheduled to begin at 6:30 p.m. ET, then the remaining undercard balance on FOX Sports 1 at 8 p.m. ET, before the PPV main card start time at 10 p.m. ET."

            "President Donald Trump insists his trade war with China will spur more manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Two of the companies he's targeted -- Apple Inc. and Ford Motor Co. -- disagree.\nCiting Trump's new tariffs, Ford on Aug. 31 said it was dropping plans to ship the Focus Active from China to America.\nTrump took to Twitter Sunday to declare victory and write: \"This is just the beginning. This car can now be BUILT IN THE U.S.A. and Ford will pay no tariffs!\"\nThe automaker has already said it has no plans to restart production elsewhere. Ford said the Trump administration's 25 percent levy on China-built autos undermined the profitability of the car.\nFord stood by its decision.\n\"It would not be profitable to build the Focus Active in the U.S. given an expected annual sales volume of fewer than 50,000 units and its competitive segment,\" Mike Levine, a spokesman for the company, tweeted in response to the president's tweet.\nFor now, that means Ford simply won't sell the vehicle in the United States. Kristin Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research said that Ford can make Focuses \"in many other plants around the world, so if they decided to continue to sell a Focus variant in the U.S. market, there are several options other than building it in the United States.\"\nA day earlier, the president exhorted Apple to start building new plants in the U.S. after the tech giant warned that a proposed $200 billion in new tariffs on Chinese imports would jack up the price of its products.\n\"Our concern with these tariffs is that the U.S. will be hardest hit, and that will result in lower U.S. growth and competitiveness and higher prices for U.S. consumers,\" Apple said in a Sept. 5 letter to the office of U.S. trade representative. It asked the government to come up with other measures to bolster the economy. Back in May, CEO Tim Cook told Trump that duties \"were not the right approach.\"\nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for a comment on Trump's latest broadside.\nThe U.S. has imposed $50 billion worth of tariffs on Chinese goods with another $200 billion in the final stages. The public had until Thursday to comment on the administration's plan. Trump said Friday he is considering another $267 billion of tariffs on China, which analysts said will affect virtually every category of consumer goods, to retaliate against what he calls unfair trade practices.\nIn Ford's case, pulling the plug on the low-volume Focus Active won't be hugely significant to its business because it sells more than 2.5 million vehicles annually in its home market. But automakers may cull other vehicles as well if Trump continues to escalate trade wars with the likes of China, Europe and Canada.\nIn April, Ford announced plans to stop making cars in the United States -- except for the iconic Mustang -- and to focus on more profitable SUVs. It stopped making Focus sedans at a Wayne, Michigan, plant in May. The plan, said industry analyst Ed Kim of AutoPacific, was to pare down the Focus lineup to Active wagons and import them from China. \"Without the tariffs, the business case was pretty solid for that model in the U.S. market,\" Kim said.\nTRADE SURPLUS WIDENS\nChina's trade surplus with the United States widened to a record $31 billion in August as exports surged despite American tariff hikes, potentially adding fuel to Trump's battle with Beijing over industrial policy.\nExports to the United States rose 13.4 percent to $44.4 billion, ticking up from July's 13.3 percent growth, according to customs data. Imports of U.S. goods rose 11.1 percent to $13.3 billion, decelerating from the previous month's 11.8 percent.\nThat could help reignite U.S. demands that Beijing narrow its trade gap, which has temporarily been overshadowed by their clash over complaints China steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology.\nWith no settlement in sight, the spiraling conflict between the two biggest economies has fed fears it will chill global trade and economic growth.\nThe Commerce Ministry expressed confidence Thursday that China can maintain \"steady and healthy\" economic growth despite the trade pressure.\nChinese leaders have rejected pressure to scale back plans for state-led development of global champions in robotics and other technologies.\nTheir trading partners complain those violate Beijing's free-trade commitments and U.S. officials worry they might erode American industrial leadership. But communist leaders see their industry plans as the path to prosperity and global influence.\nAs tensions mounted, Beijing agreed in May to narrow its trade gap with the United States by purchasing more American soybeans, natural gas and other exports. Chinese leaders scrapped that deal after Trump's first tariff hikes hit.\nChinese exporters of lower-value goods such as handbags and surgical gloves say U.S. orders have fallen off. But sellers of factory machinery and other more advanced exports express confidence they can keep their U.S. market share.\nThe Chinese customs agency took the rare step of announcing August trade data on Saturday instead of a working day. That would give financial markets a chance to digest the politically sensitive data before trading opens today.\nThe Chinese trade gap with the United States was up from July's $28 billion and June's $29 billion. Beijing reported a record $275.8 billion trade surplus with the United States last year.\nForecasters had said China's sales to the United States, its largest national export market, might weaken after manufacturers rushed to fill orders ahead of Trump's first tariff hike July 6. But trade data have yet to show a significant impact.\nChina's global exports rose 12.2 percent to $217.4 billion, down from July's 12.6 percent. Imports rose 20.9 percent to $189.5 billion, down from 21 percent.\nThe country's global trade gap was $27.9 billion. That meant that without sales to the U.S. market, China would have run a trade deficit.\nChina regularly runs deficits with many of its trading partners that supply oil, industrial components and other imports and pays for those by running a surplus with the United States and Europe.\nExports to the 28-nation European Union, China's biggest trading partner, rose 11 percent to $37 billion. Imports rose 15 percent to $24.9 billion, leaving a surplus of $6.1 billion.\nInformation for this article was contributed by Gabrielle Coppola, David Welch and Mark Gurman of Bloomberg News; and by Joe McDonald and Paul Wiseman of The Associated Press.\nA Section on 09/10/2018"

            "This article is more than 4 years old.\nMinutes after Nate Diaz appeared on stage on Friday to staredown his UFC 229 opponent, Dustin Poirier,Diaz walked out of the press conference at The Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles and raged against the UFC.\n\u201cI\u2019m not fighting on that show (expletive) the @ufc,\u201d Diaz wrote on Twitter.\nI\u2019m not fighting on that show fuk the @ufc \u2014 Nathan Diaz (@NateDiaz209) August 3, 2018\nThe video that announced the UFC 230 fight between lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov and ex-champ Conor McGregor seemed to incite Diaz\u2019s fury.\nOnce Diaz was outside the theatre, he spoke to TMZ about the incident.\n\u201cThey better start acting right. They better start over-promoting me instead of under promoting me,\u201d said Diaz. \u201cThey brought me to this press conference late. They brought me (late.)\u201d\nDiaz\u2019s fight against Poirier is scheduled to be his foray in the octagon since he dropped a majority decision to Conor McGregor in August 2016. Poirier is unbeaten in his past five outings. He\u2019s claimed fight-night bonuses on four of those contests.\nAccording to UFC President Dana White, who spoke at the UFC 227 post-fight press conference, Diaz had requested tickets for Saturday\u2019s UFC 227 event from Staples Center, but as far White knew, Diaz was a no-show at the event.\nWhen asked if everything was okay between the UFC and Diaz, White smiled and replied, \u201cYou tell me if everything\u2019s okay with Nate Diaz. If you can decipher that code, call me tomorrow and let me know.\u201d\nWhite then said he had no plans on speaking to Diaz, \u201cWhat are we going to talk about?\u201d, asked White.\nUFC 230 takes place at Madison Square Garden in New York on November 3."

            "Two weeks after Bill Cosby was sentenced to three to 10 years in state prison, his lawyers are appealing his sexual assault conviction. The motion for an appeal argues that, because of multiple alleged errors in Cosby\u2019s criminal trial, Judge Steven O\u2019Neill was mistaken in declaring Cosby a \u201csexually violent predator,\u201d the Associated Press reports.\nCosby has been in a Pennsylvania state prison since he was sentenced Sept. 25, the same day he was classified as a sexually violent predator who must register as a sex offender for the rest of his life. He was convicted in April on three counts of aggravated indecent assault for a 2004 encounter with Andrea Constand.\nBREAKING: Bill Cosby, 81, is sentenced to three to 10 years in state prison for 2004 sexual assault. \u2014 The Associated Press (@AP) September 25, 2018\nHis lawyers, who indicated in April that they planned to appeal, now claim that the sentence is too harsh for the 81-year-old. They also assert that evidence never proved that the encounter with Constand took place in 2004. Her account that the assault happened that year \u2014 not earlier \u2014 means that it fell within Pennsylvania\u2019s 12-year statute of limitations on sexual assault when she filed suit in 2016.\nThe appeal also argues that O\u2019Neill shouldn\u2019t have considered the testimony of five other women who have accused Cosby of sexual assault. The judge told the defendant at the sentencing that he had considered \u201cvoices from the past \u2014 your past,\u201d adding that he had \u201cheard their voices loud and clear,\u201d per the AP. Cosby\u2019s lawyers believe that O\u2019Neill should have allowed only those testimonies that spoke to Cosby\u2019s guilt or innocence.\nAdding to the list of complaints, Cosby\u2019s legal team questioned the Pennsylvania law requiring a judge to find a \u201cmental abnormality\u201d \u2014 which they contend has no real meaning \u2014 in order to consider someone a \u201csexually violent predator.\u201d\nStory continues\nIt\u2019s unclear when Cosby will receive a decision on his appeal, as the Montgomery County District Attorney\u2019s Office has yet to file a response. He\u2019ll remain behind bars while he waits, though.\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:"

It\u2019s a whole new movie,\u201d Gadot said when asked about the next movie, which is slated to premiere on November 1, 2019.\u201cThe bar is very, very high, but our aspirations are even higher,\u201d Gadot added, according to reports. \u201cWe just give it everything that we have, really hoping that what we bring, you guys will love.\u201dFans who lined up for hours to attend the special Warner Bros. panel were also treated to video footage from the upcoming sequel, despite the fact that filming is still ongoing.According to reports, the clip showed Gadot as Wonder Woman lassoing two guys with guns inside a mall food court, while a group of young girls watch in awe.But fans did not get any answers to a gnawing question: How does Steve Trevor (Pine) show up in the sequel if he died at the end of the first film?\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that,\u201d Pine said, as Jenkins chimed in: \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m super excited for everybody to see. It\u2019s a very important part of our movie.\u201dBut Jenkins said that Wonder Woman \u2013 Diana Prince \u2013 was still the heart and soul of the film.\u201cThe thing that I love the most about Wonder Woman, which remains true, is that I feel that she is us, more than most superheroes,\u201d the director said according to reports. \u201cPeople find themselves in Wonder Woman, in all genders, sizes and abilities... she is every one of us. That\u2019s what I care about.\u201d"

The phone parts were in remarkable condition, considering they had been belched from the ocean, Claire Simonin-Le Meur, president of the environmental group Ar Viltanso\u00f9, told The Washington Post.

Simonin-Le Meur said the common belief among locals was that the phones came from a wayward shipping container that must have sunk to the bottom of the ocean, leaving environmentalists to fear Garfield\u2019s plastic toxicity would continue to pollute the ocean indefinitely. In 2018 alone, at least 200 pieces of Garfield had been found on beaches in northwestern France, Franceinfo reported. If they could just salvage the long lost shipping container, Simonin-Le Meur said, perhaps Garfield would stop coming.\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content Photo by FRED TANNEAU/AFP/Getty Images \u201cWe were looking for it, but we had no precise idea of where it could be,\u201d Simonin-Le Meur said. \u201cWe thought it was under the sea. We asked people who were divers to look for it. We get a lot of submarines in the area too \u2014 it\u2019s a military area. But they said it was not possible the container could be there and nobody saw it.\u201d This year, however, something changed. Simonin-Le Meur got a tip. It came from a local farmer named Ren\u00e9 Morvan. All of Franceinfo\u2019s recent publicity of the bizarre phenomenon and its environmental impact had apparently sparked his memory. One day last month, Simonin-Le Meur said she met Morvan on the beach while cleaning up debris \u2013 including a Garfield part. \u201cAre you looking for Garfield?\u201d the man asked.\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content Simonin-Le Meur said yes, she was \u2014 she always was. \u201cCome with me,\u201d the man told her. \u201cI can show you.\u201d They said it was not possible the container could be there and nobody saw it Morvan started from the beginning. Back when he was 19 or 20 years old in the mid-1980s, he told her, a storm blew through the area \u2013 and before residents knew it, Garfield telephones were scattered all over the beach, just as Simonin-Le Meur had always been told. He and his brother were curious, Morvan said, and they decided to go exploring, touring the rocky coastline until they found what they were seeking. Wedged inside a cave, tucked into the seaside cliffs, there it was: a metal shipping container \u2013 and a cache of Garfield telephones, Morvan claimed he saw. The story struck Simonin-Le Meur as too good to be true. The tide was too high to bring her to the cave that day, Morvan realized, and so she would have to wait to find out if he was telling the truth. The shipping container, Morvan told her, was lodged so deep in the cave that it was nearly submerged, making the trip a dangerous expedition.\nAdvertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content But finally, last week, it was safe. The tide was low. And Morvan, Simonin-Le Meur said, ultimately was not kidding. Filming the discovery, a group of journalists and environmentalists, Simonin-Le Meur included, climbed up the rocky shore to the cave\u2019s narrow opening, finding snippets of a bright orange phone cord along the way. Garfield was scattered all about, just like on the beach. But when the group entered the cave, ready for the big reveal, they didn\u2019t find what they expected. It was clear the plastic cats had been there, Simonin-Le Meur said, but clearer still that most were already gone. \u201cOur preoccupation was to understand why we had so many Garfields everywhere. We thought it would be helpful to find the container so we can stop it. But that was unfortunately not the case,\u201d Simonin-Le Meur said. \u201cWhat we found was the remainder of the shipping container. And it was empty.\u201d\nAdvertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content Our preoccupation was to understand why we had so many Garfields everywhere It seemed the group had solved the mystery, she said, but not the problem. The \u201cT\u00e9l\u00e9phone Garfield,\u201d as it is known in an online catalogue for ubiquitous ocean debris, is just one plastic item among countless others that litter the ocean and the shore every year. In the region of northwestern France, the Garfield phone has become like an unwitting Smokey Bear, the mascot for the importance of ocean cleanup and the dangers of microplastics polluting the ocean. Lionel Lucas, who developed the online Ocean Plastic Tracker that catalogues discoveries of Garfield, told Franceinfo the Garfield phone was a \u201csymbol\u201d for the movement. \u201cIt is no longer garbage but evidence,\u201d Lucas said. Simonin-Le Meur said that she has tried to use Garfield particularly as a way to interest children in ocean pollution, given its allure compared to pieces of plastic trash. And while the recent purported discovery of Garfield\u2019s origins has drawn renewed interest, Simonin-Le Meur said, the discovery didn\u2019t change much in her eyes. \u201cWe found plastic last Friday and Saturday and Sunday, and we have found a lot of pieces of Garfield,\u201d she said. \u201cThings are just exactly the same.\u201d\nShare this article in your social network\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below."

They in particular will be reminded of what it's like to sign for red numbers again.\nGlen Abbey is a stock par 72, albeit with respective pars of 35 and 37. The par 5s are Nos. 2, 13, 16 and 18. Last year's scoring average of 70.371 established a tournament low for the course (since data was first maintained in earnest in 1983). When the wind blows, as it did early in 2016 and will a bit this week, the 5,600-square foot greens get even smaller, but Glen Abbey has yielded the most eagles of any course in each of the last five seasons it's hosted the RBC Canadian Open (2009, 2013, 2015-2017), so they are still magnets.\nGiven that Vegas prevailed despite finishing outside the top 50 in fairways hit during both of his titles proves that the only challenge besides hitting greens and rolling in putts \u2013 standard-operating procedure in all shootouts \u2013 is keeping pace. Of the 13 who finished inside the top 10 here last year, nine ranked inside the top 15 in greens in regulation. The field average of 36.32 percent in converting GIR into par breakers was a season high.\nHitting it a long way doesn't hurt, either. Only two of the top 13 on the leaderboard in 2017 averaged fewer than 299 yards in distance of all drives for the week. Vegas ranked inside the top 15 in both distance of all drives and GIR en route to both victories.\nRough is trimmed from two-and-a-half inches to three-and-a-quarter inches, with the thickest stuff protecting the primarily bentgrass greens. They're prepped to run upward of 12-and-a-half feet on the Stimpmeter, but the persistent threat of rain is poised to slow them down. Daytime temperatures will climb into the upper 70s.\nEarlier this month, it was announced that Hamilton Golf & Country Club will be hosting next year.

            "A nurse arrested on suspicion of murdering eight babies at a UK hospital has been released on bail.\nDetectives in Cheshire questioned Lucy Letby for three days before she was released on Friday morning. The 28-year-old was arrested on Tuesday as part of a year-long investigation into the deaths of babies at the Countess of Chester hospital\u2019s neonatal unit in 2015-16.\nLetby was held on suspicion of the murder of eight babies and the attempted murder of six others. She has not been charged. Police said she had been bailed pending further inquiries.\n\u201cWe continue to recognise that this investigation has a huge impact on all of the families, staff and patients at the hospital as well as members of the public. Parents of all the babies continue to be kept fully updated and are being supported throughout the process by specially trained officers,\u201d Cheshire police said.\n\u201cThis is an extremely difficult time for all the families and it is important to remember that at the heart of this there are a number of bereaved families seeking answers as to what happened to their children.\u201d\nThe force said the investigation was ongoing and there were no set timescales for progress.\nA spokesman for the Countess of Chester hospital NHS foundation trust said: \u201cWe are continuing to support Cheshire police with their ongoing investigation.\n\u201cIn line with the trust\u2019s current policies, the member of staff involved will not be returning to work while this matter is ongoing. We will not be commenting further at this time.\u201d Letby, who had worked at the hospital for seven years and had been training to work with babies in intensive care, was detained as part of an investigation into 17 deaths and 15 non-fatal collapses of babies between March 2015 and July 2016.\nIt is understood she was suspended 12 months ago and before this she had been removed from clinical duties and placed in an administrative role.\nAfter her arrest the investigation was widened to include Liverpool women\u2019s hospital, where Letby did some training. Liverpool women\u2019s NHS trust confirmed it was cooperating with the inquiry.\nOn Friday, police continued to search Letby\u2019s semi-detached home in Blacon. Neighbours said a silver Suzuki car with an NHS parking permit in the windscreen was moved at 4.30am. The vehicle had been moved to a neighbouring driveway on Tuesday to clear space to erect a blue forensics tent, which remains in place.\nIn the afternoon officers wearing white suits and blue gloves were seen carrying pieces of wood out of the property and digging up the back garden. Forensic teams were also seen conducting a fingertip search of the property, focusing on drains, window ledges and the front garden and garage.\nA police presence remained at Letby\u2019s parents\u2019 home in Hereford. A woman who answered the phone confirmed she was Letby\u2019s mother, Susan, 58, and refused to comment about her daughter\u2019s whereabouts."

            "WWE\u2019s New Day released a statement regarding Hulk Hogan\u2019s reinstatement.\nThe somewhat sudden news of the WWE reinstating Hulk Hogan into its Hall of Fame sent shockwaves across the wrestling world on Sunday.\nHogan, who was fired by the WWE after a racially insensitive rant was uncovered in 2015 \u2014 in which he used the N-word multiple times \u2014 has been on a reconciliatory path of late, with many speculating that he would eventually return to the wrestling promotion sooner rather than later.\nFor many, the 64-year-old\u2019s three-year exodus from WWE, as well as his recent attempts at making amends, were enough to heal the wound created by the iconic wrestler\u2019s offensive comments.\nShortly after news of his reinstatement broke on Sunday afternoon, Hogan revealed that he was backstage at the company\u2019s \u201cExtreme Rules\u201d event in Pittsburgh and he did, in fact, address the controversy with the WWE locker room.\nJust met with the @WWE Superstars and on all levels the volume of love and support was overwhelming. I\u2019ve been praying for this day and I finally feel like I made it back home. Only Love 4 the #WWEUNIVERSE brother HH \u2014 Hulk Hogan (@HulkHogan) July 15, 2018\nWhile Hogan referenced the \u201clove and support\u201d he had received, three of the WWE\u2019s biggest African-American stars, Kofi Kingston, Big E, and Xavier Woods, remained notably silent on social media. On Tuesday, they collectively released a statement regarding their feelings about Hogan being back in WWE\u2019s good graces.\nStory continues\n\u201cHow do we feel? Indifferent,\u201d the post reads. \u201cWe are not happy or sad, angry or resentful. Who WWE puts into the HOF is totally and completely up to the company and from a career standpoint, there is no argument on whether or not Hogan should have his place.\u201d\nThe New Day\u2019s statement is a perfectly measured and rational response to a situation in which there are no real winners. While it is true that Hogan\u2019s name is synonymous with professional wrestling, his legacy will be forever tarnished due to his use of racially insensitive terms. No number of apologies or actions can ever make them acceptable or erase them.\n\u201cWe do not respond with more feelings of hate,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cInstead, we just do not associate with the people who convey or have conveyed this negative and hurtful mindset. This instance will be no different. Perhaps if we see him make a genuine effort to change, then maybe our opinion will change with him. Time will tell.\u201d\nThe New Day\u2019s post received widespread support online, including from fellow WWE star Titus O\u2019Neil.\nIn FULL AGREEMENT AND SUPPORT OF EVERYTHING SAID IN THIS STATEMENT. MY additional response to this from to follow as there have been NUMEROUS ERRONEOUS reports on my Views and Response-to this situation. https://t.co/jCjtAusYW9 \u2014 Titus O'Neil (@TitusONeilWWE) July 18, 2018\nWhile it remains to be seen what Hogan\u2019s role will be within WWE \u2013 many of its former stars remain involved either on camera or as \u201cambassadors\u201d for the company \u2013 it\u2019s clear that he still has work to do when it comes to repairing his image and relationships with fans and talent \u2013 particularly African-Americans.\nAs the New Day so eloquently stated: Time will tell.\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\u2022 Shams Charania: Spurs deal Kawhi Leonard to Raptors for DeMar DeRozan, sources say\n\u2022 Jeff Passan: This was how Brewers\u2019 Josh Hader apologized after racist, sexist tweets surfaced\n\u2022 Antonio Brown gets \u2018Madden 19\u2019 cover\n\u2022 Pat Forde: Florida\u2019s Dan Mullen says he wants to fill The Swamp, not drain it"

The three were then swept by the current and plummeted about 100 feet into the waterfall\u2019s lower pool. All three were killed in the fall.\nGamble and Lyakh founded \"High on Life,\" along with a friend, Parker Heuser. The travel channel has more than 501,000 subscribers and over one million followers on Instagram.\nThe friends vlog about their travels around the world and have been to places such as Bali, Thailand, Greece, Italy, Vietnam, Hungary and Croatia.\nMembers of the channel gathered to make a video to address the accident, remembering their dear friends.\n\u201cThere are truly no words that can be said to ease the pain and the devastation that we are all going through right now,\u201d the group said in the video. \"They were three of the warmest, kindest, most driven and outgoing people that you could ever meet and the world has lost a great deal of light with their passing.\"\nIn the video, a passage written by both Gamble and Lyakh was read aloud as the group tried to hold back tears.\n\u201c... Follow your bliss, get out of your comfort zone, stop looking for reasons why you can\u2019t and start looking for reasons why you can and if you can, you should.\"\nThe group has asked for inspirational messages, videos and photos under the hashtag #HOLInspired to allow fans to express their condolences and thoughts.\nA GoFundMe page has also been set up for the families of Gamble, Lyakh and Scraper.\nRELATED STORIES"

            "The Philadelphia Phillies have taken significant steps forward with their rebuild this season. The team is 39-33 coming into Thursday and they're currently tied with the Washington Nationals for the second wild card spot. They're 3 1/2 games back of the Atlanta Braves in the NL East.\nIt is not surprising then that the Phillies are reportedly looking for upgrades prior to the trade deadline. Specifically, they have their eyes on Texas Rangers third baseman Adrian Beltre, according to Jon Morosi of MLB.com. From Morosi:\nThe Phillies also have interest in Beltre, sources say, as much for his professionalism as his production. The Phils have the youngest group of position players in the majors, and team officials see long-term value in Beltre's influence on an emerging core. Plus, the recent injury to J.P. Crawford has opened up more at-bats on the infield.\nBeltre, 39, is hitting .302/.357/.428 (109 OPS+) with three home runs in 45 games around a hamstring injury this season. The power numbers are not what they once were, but Beltre remains a quality hitter and a very good defender at third base. He represents a clear upgrade over Maikel Franco, who's hitting .240/.284/.409 (87 OPS+) with below-average defense.\nAs for the Rangers, they are in last place in the AL West and are expected to sell at the trade deadline, most notably impending free agent left-hander Cole Hamels. Beltre is an impending free agent himself. Given his age and the club's need to get younger, it stands to reason Texas will indeed make Beltre available at the deadline. There should be a good bidding war for his services.\nAt the moment the Phillies have received the worst third base production in baseball -- they are dead last at the position with minus-0.3 WAR this year -- because Franco has been unable to rediscover his 2015 stroke. Furthermore, Philadelphia is averaging only 3.69 runs per game over the last month, so they need a bat regardless of position. Third base is a clear spot to upgrade."

            "The Trump administration is set on Tuesday to revoke a series of Obama-era guidelines that encourage considering race in the college admissions process as a means of promoting diversity, according to a report.\nTwo sources told the Wall Street Journal that the move comes as the Justice Department investigates whether Harvard University illegally holds Asian-Americans to a higher standard in the admissions process.\nThe guidelines \u2014 put in place during the Obama administration in 2011 and 2016 \u2014 laid out legal recommendations that Trump officials argue \u201cmislead schools to believe that legal forms of affirmative action are simpler to achieve than the law allows,\u201d the paper reported.\nAnurima Bargava, who led civil rights enforcement in schools for the Justice Department during Obama\u2019s presidency, disagreed with that assessment, saying the documents simply offered guidelines to schools looking to continue using affirmative action legally.\nShe said the Trump administration\u2019s move suggests that it doesn\u2019t favor racial diversity.\n\u201cThe law on this hasn\u2019t changed, and the Supreme Court has twice ruled reaffirming the importance of diversity,\u201d she told the Journal. \u201cThis is a purely political attack that benefits nobody.\u201d\nAdministration officials didn\u2019t immediately respond to the paper\u2019s requests for comment.\nThe action comes as a lawsuit \u2014 filed in 2014 by a group called Students for Fair Admissions \u2014 is being pursued in federal court against Harvard.\nIt alleges that the Ivy League university intentionally discriminates against Asian-Americans by limiting the number of Asians who are admitted. It is expected to go to trial in October.\nIn 2016, the US Supreme Court reaffirmed the practice in a 4-3 decision \u2014 but in his opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy left the door open to future legal challenges by saying schools must continue reviewing their affirmative action policies.\nLast week, Kennedy announced his retirement from the high court, and advocates on both sides say his successor \u2014 to be nominated Monday by President Trump \u2014 may adopt a different take as the Harvard case makes its way through the courts."

            "The Wall Street Journal is reporting that a new version of the popular Nintendo Switch hardware will be arriving next year, \u201caccording to suppliers and others with direct knowledge of the plan.\u201d\nThere are few other details about what the new hardware revision would improve over the current model.\n\u201cThe current Switch uses a lower-end liquid-crystal display without some technologies that are standard in more recent smartphone LCDs,\u201d The Wall Street Journal reported. \u201cUpdating the display with these technologies would make it brighter, thinner and more energy-efficient. The updated Switch isn\u2019t expected to adopt the organic light-emitting diode or OLED panels used in Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhone X series.\u201d\nRelated Nintendo Switch review\nNintendo has already sold almost 20 million units of the hardware worldwide between its launch in 2017 and June 30 of this year, and an updated version of the system could help maintain that high level of player enthusiasm. The new hardware is reported to be on the way for the second half of 2019, giving the current version of the system another big holiday season in its current configuration.\nNintendo executives have stated in the past that not only does the company want every family to own a Nintendo Switch, it would like for every member of the family to have their own system.\n\u201cThe biggest attraction of Nintendo Switch is that the console can be carried around and used easily for competitive gameplay via local wireless connection,\u201d Nintendo creative fellow Shigeru Miyamoto stated during a financial briefing earlier this year. \u201cIf consumers come to take it for granted that everybody has a Nintendo Switch, then we can create new and very Nintendo genres of play, and Nintendo Switch can have a life apart from smart devices and other video game systems. Expanding the Nintendo Switch world this way is a means of eliminating risk.\u201d\nHaving a new, somehow more advanced version of the Switch could be an effective way to sell family\u2019s a second unit without having them trade-in or sell their first Switch console."

            "Tributes have been paid to the anarchic comedian Ian Cognito, who died on stage during a gig on Thursday night. The cult standup was performing at the Lone Wolf Comedy Club night at the Atic bar in Bicester when he fell ill and took a seat. Some members of the audience reportedly thought that it was part of the act but paramedics were called to the venue and he was pronounced dead.\nKaty Brand was among those to pay homage to Cognito, a Time Out comedy award-winner who was known as \u201cCogs\u201d on the circuit. \u201cI hung with him a good few times in the past,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was always fascinating and hilarious company. RIP Cogs.\u201d Paul Sinha said he had \u201cdeeply envied\u201d Cognito\u2019s fearlessness, calling him \u201ca gentleman \u2013 a terrifying gentleman\u201d. Luisa Omielan said he was \u201cas epic as his reputation. Rebellious and brilliant.\u201d\nCognito once claimed he had been banned from more clubs than any comedian in the country. He was known for taking the stage with a hammer, banging a nail into the wall and then hanging up his hat. \u201cThis lets you know two things about me,\u201d he would shout. \u201cFirstly, I really don\u2019t give a shit. Secondly, I\u2019ve got a hammer.\u201d\nCognito was born Paul Barbieri in 1958. Despite the admiration of his peers, he did not achieve mainstream success with his often furious routines. \u201cI\u2019m not really built for that commercial type of thing,\u201d he told the Guardian in 2002. He published a memoir, A Comedian\u2019s Tale, in which he described his onstage character as his \u201cMr Hyde\u201d. He also released an album of standup and songs entitled Sex and Death.\nFellow comedians commented on Cognito\u2019s generosity. Matt Lucas said he \u201cwas always kind to me when I started out\u201d and that he was \u201cbrilliant and provocative\u201d on stage.\nJimmy Carr tweeted: \u201cVeteran standup comedian Ian Cognito has died on stage \u2013 literally. The audience thought it was part of the act. Died with his boots on. That\u2019s commitment to comedy. I\u2019ll never forget his kindness when I started out and how god damn funny he was.\u201d"

            "Apple's Beats brand today officially announced the new Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earphones, which, like the AirPods, are wire-free and come with a charging case, but feature up to nine hours of listening time.\nThe Powerbeats Pro are going to cost $250, and Apple says they are coming in May. According to Apple, the \u200cPowerbeats Pro\u200c deliver \"powerful, balanced sound with dynamic range and noise isolation for a premium listening experience.\"\nThe \u200cPowerbeats Pro\u200c, like the current Powerbeats, are sweat and water resistant and include the Powerbeats earhooks along with tips in four sizes for keeping them securely in place during workouts.\n\"Powerbeats Pro is a harmonious blend of premium sound, fit and functionality. Powerbeats are already the #1 fitness headphones in the world and they are now untethered, with all the benefits of the Apple H1 chip,\" said Luke Wood, president of Beats. \"No longer do you have to choose between performance and practicality--it delivers the best on both fronts.\"\nTo get an ideal fit for most people, Apple tested more than 20 configurations to arrive at an \"ergonomically angled housing\" designed to nest \"comfortably in the concha bowl of the ear with an off-axis nozzle.\" Apple says \u200cPowerbeats Pro\u200c are 23 percent smaller and 17 percent lighter than the Powerbeats 3.\nThere are physical controls on each earbud, with a dedicated volume buttons for adjusting the volume, and a button for answering and declining phone calls and changing the track that's currently playing. Like the AirPods, the \u200cPowerbeats Pro\u200c automatically detect when they're in your ears and can play/pause music accordingly.\nThe \u200cPowerbeats Pro\u200c come in their own clamshell-style charging case, which adds over 24 hours of combined playback with the nine hours of listening time that you get from each earbud. There's a 5-minute Fast Fuel feature that provides up to 1.5 hours of playback in five minutes.\nApple says the \u200cPowerbeats Pro\u200c use \"Class 1 Bluetooth technology\" for extended range and fewer dropouts, and the H1 chip that's in the second-generation AirPods is also in the \u200cPowerbeats Pro\u200c.\nApple is making the \u200cPowerbeats Pro\u200c available in four colors: Black, Ivory, Moss, and Navy. The \u200cPowerbeats Pro\u200c launch in May in US and more than 20 additional countries and regions, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Macau, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK."

            "ATLANTA \u2013 On a night when Brad Stevens lamented his team\u2019s inability to deal with adversity on the road, the Celtics finally gave him a surprise with Saturday night\u2019s 113-105 win over the Atlanta Hawks.\nBeyond their early trouble on the home court of yet another mediocre team, the Celtics were forced to fight without Marcus Smart, ejected in the third quarter after attempting to charge at Hawks forward DeAndre Bembry.\nStripped of their emotional leader, the Celtics hit back from a variety of angles, with Jaylen Brown (nine fourth-quarter points) and Al Horford (13 points) carrying the team down the fourth quarter stretch.\nPer usual, Kyrie Irving filled in all the available gaps with a 32-point, five-trey performance.\nBut on a night that cried out for Smart\u2019s gritty approach to the game, the Celtics carried on in that style without him. They overcame a 16-point second quarter deficit \u2013 the result of some hot early offense from the likes of the Hawks\u2019 Kevin Huerter and John Collins \u2013 and played their best basketball down the stretch with a 10-0 game-sealing run in the last five minutes.\nIt appears, though, Smart wasn\u2019t merely upset with Bembry, or two rapid-fire calls from referee Scott Foster leading up to his implosion.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a competitor \u2013 he wants to get himself going, wants to get us going, and he wasn\u2019t happy with the way we were playing,\u201d Horford said. \u201cHe let his emotions get out of hand, but after that we had to refocus and understand we had a game at hand and continue to play well.\u201d\nStevens certainly got what he was looking for, after observing before the game that unlike last season, when the team had the best road record in the Eastern Conference, the Celtics haven\u2019t recovered well on the road this season.\n\u201cThis was a good win for us,\u201d the coach said. \u201cWe need that kind of response to what we\u2019ve done in the last few opportunities.\u201d\nThe Celtics, who have never been streakier in the Stevens era, thus erased memory of their 0-3 trip through Miami, Orlando and Brooklyn with a three-game win streak \u2013 Saturday night\u2019s on the second half of a back-to-back.\nTerry Rozier, this time with an expanded role because of Smart\u2019s absence, once again helped change Saturday night\u2019s course with his energy and ball pressure as much or more than his offensive role.\n\u201cMan, I think Terry\u2019s energy, picking up full court, rebounding the ball, making plays, and the rest of the group followed,\u201d Horford said. \u201cJaylen also had some good plays. The bench really got us going, and then we were ready to finish the game.\u201d\nHorford\u2019s tip-in of a Jayson Tatum miss with 1:47 left gave the Celtics a 107-100 lead. He had just scored the last six Celtics points in the 10-0 run, which Irving capped in grand style when, after nearly slipping and losing the ball during a drive, he wheeled into the lane with a running hook for a 109-100 lead with 1:11 left.\nThe volatile nature of the third quarter considered, with Smart storming to the locker room after his second technical foul, the Celtics came out of the stretch in decent shape, cutting the Atlanta lead to 89-83 on an Aron Baynes jump hook.\nRozier, whose energy was pivotal during the winning streak the Celtics carried into Saturday night, triggered the Celtics\u2019 best move of the night with five straight points early in the fourth off a 3-pointer and fast break dunk off a steal.\nThe result was a 14-2 Celtics run that included a Baynes tip dunk and a Brown 3-pointer for the Celtics\u2019 first lead of the night at 95-93 with 9:07 left.\nTrey Young lost the ball in the lane, leading to Brown\u2019s drive for a foul, two free throws and his seventh straight point \u2013 four of those from the line.\nYoung\u2019s 3-pointer finally got in the way, cutting the Celtics lead to a point (97-96) with 7:55 left. But Brown drove for his ninth straight point and a 99-96 lead.\nAlen Len scored twice, including a jump hook for a brief 100-99 Hawks lead before Irving drove to take the lead back.\nBoth sides stumbled, from Tatum\u2019s block of Jeremy Lin and an air ball by the latter to a Horford travel call.\nHorford nearly compounded the stretch when he missed an open layup. But he was fouled on the rebound, and with a section of fans chanting \u201cYou\u2019re a traitor,\u201d hit twice for a 103-101 lead.\nIrving launched an air ball the next time down, but Horford made good again, getting fouled while grabbing a Tatum miss and converting twice, now for a five-point lead.\nAnother Young miss led to a Tatum drive, and a Horford put-back with 1:47 left for a 107-100 Celtics lead that would stick."

According to Shams Charania of Yahoo Sports, the former Jayhawks shooting guard has agreed to a two-way deal with the Los Angeles Lakers.\nSources: Undrafted Kansas guard Malik Newman has agreed to a two-way contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. \u2014 Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) June 22, 2018\nBefore playing in Kansas, Malik Newman spent his first season in the SEC with the Mississippi State Bulldogs as a freshman. Upon transfer to Lawrence, he sat out one year before emerging as one of the best offensive weapons for Bill Self\u2019s team. He averaged 14.2 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 2.1 assists last season for Kansas while also shooting 46.3 percent from the field and 39.9 percent from downtown.\nNewman decided to declare for the draft following a terrific string of performances in the NCAA National Tournament in which he put up 24.5 points in four games from the second round until the Final Four round. Not one game boosted his stock more as an NBA prospect than the meeting with Duke in the Elite Eight round, where he scored 32 points (13 in overtime) with five 3-pointers and seven assists.\nOther than Newman, the Lakers also got Mo Wagner of Michigan and Newman\u2019s teammate in Kansas, Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk.\nWith a two-way contract, Newman is expected to spend most of his rookie season playing for the South Bay Lakers in the G League."

            "Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) hold a substantial lead over their Democrat competitors for the 2020 presidential nomination, according to a poll released Monday.\nAccording to an Emerson national poll released Monday, Sanders holds the lead with 29 percent of Democrat primary voters\u2019 support, followed by Biden with 24 percent, and then by South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at nine percent.\nFormer Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-TX) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) follow at eight percent, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) at seven percent. The poll was conducted between April 11 and 14 of Democrat primary votesr with a margin of error of 5.2 percent.\nWhile several polls have shown Sanders and Biden holding a strong lead, Buttigieg, who announced his candidacy for president on Sunday, has skyrocketed in the polls recently.\nSpencer Kimball, director of Emerson Polling, said Monday, \u201cwhile still early in the nominating process, it looks like Mayor Pete is the candidate capturing voters\u2019 imagination; the numbers had him at zero percent in mid-February, 3 percent in March and now at 9 percent in April.\u201d\n\u201cBiden has seen his support drop,\u201d Kimball said. \u201cIn February, he led Sanders 27 percent to 17 percent, and in March the two were tied at 26 percent. Now, Sanders has a 5 point lead, 29 percent to 24 percent.\u201d\nBiden, who has yet to announce his candidacy for president, has held strong polling in the last few months. However, should Biden not run for president, then Sanders will pick up 31 percent support, and Buttigieg will get 17 percent of the Biden vote, followed by O\u2019Rourke at 13 percent.\nIn a one-on-one matchup, Biden serves as the most competitive opponent against Trump, where Biden would gain 53 percent support to Trump\u2019s 47 percent; however, this serves as a four-point drop compared to Emerson\u2019s March poll, where Biden led Trump 55 to 45 percent.\nSince the March poll, Biden has faced accusations of inappropriate touching from multiple women.\nThe April Emerson poll has shown a general tightening in the polls between Trump and potential 2020 Democrats.\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump has attacked Democrats for obstructing his America First agenda.\nTrump tweeted Monday, \u201cThe Radical Left Democrats will never be satisfied with anything we give them. They will always Resist and Obstruct!\u201d\nThe Radical Left Democrats will never be satisfied with anything we give them. They will always Resist and Obstruct! \u2014 Donald J.

The fun of sports debates is that they\u2019re inherently subjective, and subjectivity allows for a discussion. But some things in sports are objective. When you ignore objectivity, then you\u2019re no longer allowing for a discussion on sports, and instead have someone yelling threats at you like what Shannon Sharpe did here.\nSecondly, there\u2019s no provided insight after the statement. Sharpe is having a sincere discussion about Dirk Nowitzki\u2019s career, and in the middle of it, Skip Bayless just interjects with an asinine statement to never be revisited. No facts or evidence was given afterward. Bayless just said a thing and supported the thing with nothing.\nWatch for yourself:\n\u201cI think Manu Ginobili is better than Hakeem [Olajuwon], but that\u2019s just me\u201d- #Spurs fan Skip Bayless pic.twitter.com/DujdkBKe14 \u2014 Crazy Fan Takes (@CrazyFanTakes) February 18, 2019\nFor those who can\u2019t watch/hear the discussion:\nSharpe: *talking about Hakeem Olajuwon being the greatest foreign player of all time*\nSkip: (Unprompted) I must add I think Manu Ginobili is better than Hakeem - but that\u2019s just me. I\u2019m going to throw it out there cause he\u2019s -\u201d\nSharpe: \u201cI\u2019m going to throw you out of the building.\u201d\nBayless: \u201c - You don\u2019t get how special Manu was.

Again, it\u2019s not a discussion worth having. I\u2019m not even going to give the stats because we wouldn\u2019t have to revisit the stats to know the truth.\nWhat would happen if I did anyway?\n-\u201cWell, did you know Ginobili averaged 19.5 points in 2008?\u201d\n-\u201cOh, wow. That trumps Hakeem being the all-time leader in blocks any day!\u201d\nRaising a ludicrous point and immediately backing it by saying that it\u2019s your opinion isn\u2019t entertaining or insightful or even fun. It sounds like someone being edgy for the sake of being edgy - like the sports version of Ricky Gervais. You now just have a bunch of people gathering more talking points about how much of a terrible TV show host you are.\nStill, if Bayless was just looking for a bunch of people to discuss him (which he probably was), then congrats because he got me to talk about him."

The attorney said he temporarily shut down the account because of online threats.\n\u201cThis is just crazy that somebody can just tweet something out like this, or post it, and people just take it as truth,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201d\nAvenatti, a possible presidential contender in 2020, said his client is \u201c100 percent\u201d real and still planned to come forward.

Avenatti said the client had agreed to an FBI investigation and a polygraph test.\nWhen asked whether she would take her story public regardless of whether the committee called her to testify, Avenatti responded: \u201cCorrect.\u201d\n\u201cWe have not arrived at a firm plan relating to the initial disclosure of these allegations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are still working through it.

            "Last updated on .From the section Tennis\nSloane Stephens has won both her group matches at the WTA Finals in a deciding set\nSloane Stephens beat Kiki Bertens at the WTA Finals, in a result that spared US Open champion Naomi Osaka early elimination.\nThe American, 25, won six of the last seven games to claim the match 7-6 (7-4) 2-6 6-3.\nThe victory means all four players in the Red Group can still qualify or be eliminated going into the final games.\nOsaka has lost both her round-robin matches, but can progress if she wins and the other result goes her way.\nIn Friday's final round of fixtures, Osaka plays Bertens while Stephens faces Angelique Kerber, who beat Osaka earlier on Wednesday and has one win from two.\nStephens and Bertens, 26, traded breaks throughout in a match which saw momentum change regularly.\nFifth seed Stephens won the first-set tie-break, before Bertens broke three times in the second set to win it in 36 minutes.\nThe third set continued the trend as the Dutchwoman won the first two games before Stephens took the match away from her. The 25-year-old now has two wins from two in the group stage, while Bertens has one.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Kerber beat Osaka 6-4 5-7 6-4 in a match that included 11 breaks of serve.\nGermany's Kerber, 30, won the first set and was a break up at 5-4 in the second, but the Japanese fought back to level the match. Kerber then won the final set to clinch the match, which lasted 2 hours and 31 minutes.\nThere is a similar situation in the White Group, in which Elina Svitolina, Karolina Pliskova, Caroline Wozniacki and Petra Kvitova can all still qualify after two matches.\nThe WTA Finals feature the top eight players this year, split into two groups of four. The top two from each group progress to the semi-finals, with the final on Sunday."

United, JetBlue and Alaska Airlines were also affected by the computer outage, as well as American Airlines regional carriers, the FAA said.\nAerodata, the system which went down, is used by the airlines use to check the weight and balance of planes before takeoff. Aerodata has not yet responded to ABC News' requests for comment.\nPlanes were grounded nationwide, including in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, but systems for at least three of the major airlines were resolved within about an hour. The rest of the impacted airlines resolved the issue in the following hours.\nDelta, Southwest and American each reported the computer system issue was resolved before 8:30 a.m. and Southwest reported its ground stop was lifted within 40 minutes. Both Delta and Southwest said the outage caused delays but not cancellations. The short time down was not predicted to cause major ripple effects for travel Monday, but had the largest effect on Southwest flights.\nTwenty-two percent of Southwest flights were delayed Monday, according to the live flight-tracking website FlightAware, while other airlines saw delays in the ballpark of 2 to 5 percent.\nMost of the airlines apologized to passengers and asked for patience in response to grievances aired on Twitter, saying they were working to reduce the impact of scattered delays.\n\"A brief third-party technology issue that prevented some Delta Connection flights from being dispatched on time this morning has been resolved. No cancellations are expected due to the issue and our teams are working to resolve some resulting delays,\" Delta said in a statement.\n\"The technical issue that impacted a few of our regional carriers has been resolved. We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience,\" American Airlines responded to passenger complaints on Twitter.\n\"We\u2019re working with Customers on any impacts to their travel plans and we appreciate their understanding as we place nothing higher than the safe operation of every flight,\" Southwest said in a statement.\nMonday morning's computer issues come after several airlines of the same airlines suffered another outage to a different system last week. The Sabre system, which handles ticketing and boarding, affected American, JetBlue and Alaska Airlines.\nABC News' David Kerley and Jeffrey Cook contributed to this report."

            "Arby\u2019s owner Inspire Brands announced it is buying carhop-style burger chain Sonic Corp. for $2.3B, including debt.\nThe move builds on the fast-food conglomerate\u2019s existing survival strategy of vacuuming up interesting restaurant chains to protect itself from the food fads and economic downturns that run rampant in the mouth-fuel industry.\nAnd Arby\u2019s is the one leading the charge?\nYou bet your sweet roast beast. Arby\u2019s Restaurant Group (majority owned by Roark Capital) created Inspire in February after the Arby\u2019s and Buffalo Wild Wings merger \u2014 and it\u2019s clearly just the tip of the sauce bottle for what\u2019s to come.\nAccording to WSJ, CEO Paul Brown hopes to \u2019suade die-hards of one chain to visit others in Inspire\u2019s expanding portfolio (which plans to buy as many as 10 chains with annual sales of up to $4.5B).\nFor now, Sonic is the \u2018ideal fit\u2019 to beef up the portfolio\nFirst opened in 1953 Oklahoma as a root-beer stand, Sonic is now the largest drive-in chain in the country with 3.5k restaurants in 44 states.\nLike other beleaguered fast-foodies on Inspire\u2019s roster, Sonic struggled to flip \u2019em fast enough to keep up with the competitive fast-food industry \u2014 Sonic shares have trailed burger barons like McDonald\u2019s and Red Robin.\nIn other words, Sonic needed a pick-me-up, and Inspire was there with a silver spatula to the rescue.\nHOT TAKE: Arby\u2019s is the most innovative chain in the drive thru\nThink about it: How many other roast beef sandwich fast-food restaurants can you name? 1? maybe 2? If so, they\u2019re surely regional.\nYet, somehow, the mystery meat king tricked everyone into thinking its beef is \u201ccool-different,\u201d not \u201cgross-different.\u201d\nThey also invented frappuccinos (AKA, Jamocha shakes) and rebranded horseradish to \u201chorsey sauce\u201d so that no one even stopped to ask, \u201cIs this just horseradish with a better name?\u201d\nOh, and their BBQ sauce, AKA Arby\u2019s sauce? Eat our shorts, Sweet Baby Ray\u2019s.\nRANT over."

            "Although the Dallas Cowboys lost their preseason opener to the San Francisco 49ers, here are some of the players who earned their Star Thursday night.\nFinally, after a long offseason, the Dallas Cowboys are playing actual football again. And against a team other than themselves! The Cowboys kicked off their preseason on Thursday night, playing the San Francisco 49ers at Levi\u2019s Stadium.\nAlthough Dallas would end up losing the exhibition 24-21, there were several Cowboys who played well in the contest. Here is my list of players whom I believed earned their beloved Star on Thursday night.\nMichael Gallup, Wide Receiver\nNo single player captured the hearts and minds of Cowboys fans more than rookie wide receiver Michael Gallup did against the Niners. The 22-year old caught only one pass on the night. But it was a 30-yard touchdown catch on the opening series of the game with a majority of the starters playing on both sides.\nGallup would later get wide open on another play, but backup quarterback Cooper Rush underthrew the ball for an incompletion. That play only helped to reinforce the idea that this rookie receiver could make a big contribution for Dallas this season. All aboard! The Gallup-hype train is leaving the station.\nLance Lenoir, Wide Receiver\nThe other wide receiver that exited the Cowboys first preseason game rated higher than when he entered is Lance Lenoir. The second-year wideout has played well in training camp and continued that level of play into the team\u2019s first preseason game.\nKnown for making flashy catches in camp, Lenoir made a beautiful two-yard touchdown catch in the back of the end zone off a play action pass from Rush. The toe-tapping reception was reminiscent of the Santonio Holmes catch that won Super Bowl XLIII for the Pittsburgh Steelers back in 2009.\nSuddenly, Lenior appears to be the favorite to win a spot on the active roster. Now the question is which Cowboys receiver is suddenly expendable?"

I'm not superstitious or any of this bullshit, but... the car's cursed. I don't have any more words.\u201d\nRicciardo had taken pole but bogged down badly at the start, allowing teammate Max Verstappen and Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton through.\nHe said: \u201cHelpless I think is the best word.\n\"Even today, you know, the starts have been good all weekend, the practice starts, and for the race start, it's all over the place with the pre-start.\n\u201cJust things are happening on Sunday which I've got no more explanation for. The car... I'll let Gasly drive it, I'm done with it.\u201d\nRed Bull had suffered a hydraulics failure with Verstappen's car in practice \u2013 and speaking to Sky Sports after the race, team boss Christian Horner said Ricciardo's race was ended by what was likely another hydraulics problem.\n\u201cWe need to get the car back [to be sure] but you can see the smoke come out of the back of the car, 10 laps from the end,\u201d he said.\n\u201cJust gutting for him because he had driven a great race on old tyres, holding off Sebastian [Vettel] before that tell-tale sign of smoke. All we could do was retire the car.\u201d\nHorner said Ricciardo's misfortune soured what was Red Bull's best race in a while, as Verstappen romped to victory.\n\u201cThe thing that feels bittersweet is we should've have had them both up there,\u201d he said.\nDaniel Ricciardo, Red Bull Racing RB14 Photo by: Steven Tee / LAT Images"

Gators at The Swamp Park in Ocean Isle Beach froze in place with their noses sticking out of the icy water so they can breathe, The Associated Press reports.\nSwamp Park manager George Howard said 18 American alligators at the park froze Monday night and stayed frozen all day Tuesday, The Charlotte Observer reports. The alligators seem to sense when the water is about to hit the freezing point and they poke their noses into the air \"at just the right moment,\" Howard said.\nWhen the water or air temperatures dip too low for them to be active, the cold-blooded reptiles go into a \"state of brumation,\" Howard said. Brumation is a hibernation-like state for reptiles.\nPhotos of the frozen gators at the Swamp Park went viral last year, too. The Swamp Park\nThe same phenomenon happened last winter, when gators in the 65-acre park and sanctuary froze with their noses sticking out of the swap and the images went viral. Those alligators thawed out within days and had no apparent injuries as a result of their deep freeze, Howard said.\nAlligators can live in water temperatures as low as 40 degrees, the staff of the Shallotte River Swamp Park wrote in a blog post. \"This is where a reptile's metabolism slows down dramatically and will go into a lethargic state,\" they said.\n\"Often during this time, an alligator will stay at the bottom of a body of water.

Later that day, Musk released a company blog post elaborating on his tweet.\n\u201cAs a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m trying to accomplish an outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible, and where there is as little change for all of our investors, including all of our employees, as possible.\u201d\nIn his lawsuit, Isaacs argued that Tesla and Musk did not address the claim from who, where and how the funding to take the company private was secured in the blog post or in other media.\nStart your day with the news you need from the Bay Area and beyond.\nSign up for our Morning Report weekday newsletter.\nIn a separate follow-up tweet Tuesday, Musk wrote, \u201cInvestor support is confirmed.

        "articles": [
            "Ole Miss had arguably the most talented group of pass-catchers in college football in 2018. D.K. Metcalf and A.J. Brown are clear early-round picks, and Damarkus Lodge also has a chance to get drafted.\nWhile those players are a dynamic trio, Ole Miss produced another talented pass-catcher in tight end Dawson Knox. But Knox didn\u2019t have the production you would expect from such a prospect, with 15 catches on 28 targets in 2018.\nThe Buffalo Bills saw something in Knox, and selected him with the 96th pick in the 2019 NFL Draft.\nEven though Knox didn\u2019t see too many opportunities in college, he was still pretty efficient with his touches. In 2018 he averaged 18.9 yards per catch.\nCollege production is important, but don\u2019t worry too much about Knox\u2019s. Just watch the tape.\nKnox may not have seen the ball all that often in college, but he\u2019s still a pretty talented receiving tight end. Knox can do just about everything when it comes to catching the football. He can make plays in traffic deep down the field, secure tough catches over the middle, and run after the catch.\nThis play against Vanderbilt \u2014 his only catch of the day \u2014 shows off his ability to high point the ball deep down the field. Vanderbilt has two defenders in the vicinity, but he\u2019s still able to come down with the ball.\nKnox also has the athleticism to create plays after the catch, with solid speed and agility showings at the NFL Combine. This play against Arkansas is a great example:\nOle Miss runs him into the flat, and he gets a great block from Lodge to spring him free for more yards. Knox isn\u2019t a speed demon, but he still has enough juice to make defenses pay when he has a crease.\nIn the few opportunities Knox did get, he showed off the ability to be a legitimate threat as a passing target.\nWhich begs the following question:\nSo ... why didn\u2019t Knox get the ball more often?\nSB Nation caught up with Knox at the 2019 NFL Combine to try and figure out why a player who is clearly talented wasn\u2019t a bigger piece of the offense.\nKnox\u2019s answer was pretty simple: Brown, Metcalf, and Lodge are really, really good.\n\u201cGoing into the season, I was hoping that it would help me a little more than it did,\u201d Knox said. \u201cI was like, \u2018I got three potential first-round guys \u2014 definitely two or three top-two-round guys around me \u2014 they\u2019re gonna be doubling those guys, so surely I\u2019ll get the ball more.\u2019 But it was still fun playing with guys of that talent.\u201d\nOne thing working in Knox\u2019s favor as he projects himself to the next level is the fact that NFL offenses feature tight ends more than the offense he played in during college. He\u2019ll get to run more a more diverse set of routes on Sundays than he did for Rebels QB Jordan Ta\u2019amu.\n\u201cFive or six of my 15 catches were on the same route. It would just be a little 12- to 15-yard over route over the middle of the field.\u201d Knox said. \u201cI would be the first read on that, Jordan would find a window and fit it in to me. That was probably my favorite because we ran it the most and I had the most production on those plays.\u201d\nKnox\u2019s ability to catch the ball over the middle was on display in the 2018 Egg Bowl against Mississippi State. This pass was a little high, but that didn\u2019t stop Knox from bringing down with two defenders in the vicinity. He wasn\u2019t afraid to get hit by Mississippi State\u2019s safeties, showing the fearlessness you\u2019d hope to see out of a tight end:\nOf course, NFL teams had similar concerns about his lack of production in college. Knox said he was asked about that during his interviews with teams at the combine.\n\u201cYeah, as you can probably imagine, but honestly I\u2019m not even worried about it because I also have enough film to show that if the ball went to me every time I was open, I\u2019d have as high \u2014 or higher \u2014 stats than anyone here,\u201d Knox said.\n\u201cAlso I know that offensive systems in the NFL are going to be a lot different. Which is something that people might think is going to be a concern for me because I\u2019m only running five or six routes a year at Ole Miss,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the thing I\u2019m most excited about, getting into a system that utilizes matchups more. Just an extended route tree that\u2019s going to open up a lot more things for me.\u201d\nDespite the concerns about his production in college, Knox still looks like a solid NFL prospect. Ole Miss had a lot of mouths to feed in its offense, and he just ended up being an afterthought at times.\nKnox\u2019s ability as a receiver should get him on the field early as a rookie. In a class filled with a few stud tight end prospects, Knox could end up being the best of the bunch."

            "We meet again, Canes fam! After 2 installments of our round table discussion about Miami-FSU, we now come to the piece you\u2019ve been waiting for: our predictions. Before we get there, let\u2019s go back.\nHere\u2019s part 1 of our round table:\nHere\u2019s part 2 of our round table:\nAnd now, here are our predictions:\nPrediction time. How do you see the game playing out?\nCam Underwood: I\u2019ve said this all week long, and even a while before that referring to last year\u2019s Miami-FSU game: if you put up anonymous stat profiles for these teams and asked people to choose a winner and winning margin, people would unanimously choose the Miami-profile team to win by 21+ points.\nBUT, when you put names on the teams, and consider the rivalry nature of this game, things aren\u2019t as clear as the profiles on paper might lead people to believe.\nI don\u2019t think that FSU can block Miami\u2019s defensive line, and their offense won\u2019t be able to get going because of that. And with Miami playing a new QB, one who is accurate and has the arm to take advantage of the receivers I believe will be running open all day long, and plenty of skill position talent to exploit the already-seen holes in FSU\u2019s defense, I don\u2019t think this game ends up being all that close.\nFinal Score: Miami 38 Florida State 20\nEvan Hadrick: I think the defense makes some plays early and just makes HRS goes nuts. FSU then falls apart and returns to early season form. Miami 34 - FSU 13.\nMatt Washington: Miami holds off FSU, wins the turnover battle and ultimately come out on top. Final Score: MIA 30-FSU 24\nJohn Camera: I think it\u2019s going to be all Miami through 2.5 quarters before FSU creeps in to make it a game. Perry has a turnover or two but ultimately, FSU\u2019s comeback falls short. 30-21 Miami.\nGaby Urrutia: I can see this being a game, at least for a little bit. Emotions will be high and I would not expect Florida State to just roll over and let us dog them. I do, however, expect the game to finish with Miami on top and the score being lopsided. I believe the Hurricanes defense is as hot as any unit in the country and Florida State is in the line of fire. There is nothing that Willie Taggart can throw at Manny Diaz that he isn\u2019t ready for.\nI believe Perry can make the throws that were open all game last week for Louisville and Miami can impose their will on the weak secondary that Florida State has put together.\nFinal Score: Miami 38 Florida State 17\nMarshall Thomas: I see it being very close in the first half, and both teams struggling to score early, maybe Miami 10-6 at half. However, I think Perry strings together a few scoring drives in the third quarter, and then a pick by Francois will open the floodgates where FSU can\u2019t recover from. Miami wins 31-13.\nDylan Sherry: I see Miami winning, but not as much as they\u2019re favored by. My score prediction is Miami 31-24. I see Miami giving up 24 points due to the fact that FSU\u2019s offense will guard better than they have all season, in addition to the that fact that the \u2018Canes have bent but not broken to some teams -- I expect the FSU game to go in a similar way. The \u2018Canes defense will give up yards, but stiffen up when they need to. If Malik was starting, I\u2019d go with the \u2018Canes winning 28-24, but I think Perry will lead them to victory, and end up getting the extra score that Miami needs in order to end the game in the victory formation.\nKevin Fielder: I think this game will be closer than most think. I think Miami takes an early 10-0 lead after an N\u2019Kosi Perry touchdown pass to Michael Harley and a short field goal. However, I think the Seminoles offense begins to gain speed and take a lead going into halftime at 13-10. In the second half, I think the Hurricanes prove to be too much for the Seminoles and the experienced players on both ends (Travis Homer, Jeff Thomas, Shaq Quarterman, Joe Jackson) begin to control the line of scrimmage and dominate the game. I have the Canes winning 31-16 with a big performance from N\u2019Kosi Perry (270+ yards and 3 touchdowns) and the offense in the second half\nCraig T. Smith: Can you believe it\u2019s been since September 2004 that Miami has won at home against FSU? That was a month before I became a lawyer, and it feels like I\u2019ve been one for a lifetime. It\u2019s time for UM to ditch this curse and continue to make Hard Rock Stadium a special place for the Canes. Dallas and Travis Homer pace an offense that gets the Canes into the upper 20s, the defense thwarts a late Nole drive and Miami wins a tight one 28-24.\nAnd there you have it. Our picks for Miami-FSU.\nYou have picks too, so share them in the comments below. And, who knows, there may even be a gift for the person closest to the actual score. Maybe.\nGo Canes"

        "label": "Eric Weddle Baltimore Ravens",
        "articles": [
            "With a loaded safety market, Baltimore will try their hand at finding a longer-term solution. Who could they target? And where could Weddle play in 2019?\nSince the Super Bowl, I\u2019ve watched film and talked scheme with about 50 NFL coaches. For the second straight year, the only defensive schemes anyone has truly praised are Chicago\u2019s and Baltimore\u2019s. Ravens conversations have been the most abundant. Roughly two dozen coaches\u2014some close to the team, others only familiar with them from afar\u2014marvel at that Baltimore scheme\u2019s aggression and efficacy. And to a man, these coaches have cited Eric Weddle as the key ingredient.\nNo one has said Weddle performs at an All-Pro level. At 34, his speed and quickness have diminished, and he\u2019s no longer the soundest tackler. But his IQ is towering and, more importantly, so is his confidence. That has made him the most daring and creative pre-snap disguise artist in football. His willingness to get out of position pre-snap and change his\u2014or a teammate\u2019s\u2014assignment on the fly gives Baltimore\u2019s defense its trademark deceptiveness.\nThe Ravens tend to play similar six-man matchup-zone coverages from snap-to-snap, but you\u2019re never quite sure who the six zone defenders will be or where they\u2019ll align because you\u2019re never quite sure what to make of Weddle, who moves all over before the snap. This is even truer with Baltimore\u2019s blitz packages.\nThe Ravens, presumably, believe their defense is strong enough to make them contenders in 2019, even if the offense will be adjusting to developmental second-year quarterback Lamar Jackson. Which makes it all the more surprising that Weddle, it\u2019s key ingredient, would be cut in order to save $6.5 million.\nBut a deeper look reveals the logic behind the move. The Ravens, who are young in key spots on both sides of the ball, see themselves not just as contenders in 2019, but contenders for years to come. A smart, versatile safety is vital to their scheme, and Weddle, at this point, might have only a year or two left in the tank. This year\u2019s free agent safety class is unusually deep and, more importantly, unusually top heavy.\nIt might not be coincidental that Weddle\u2019s release came after the Giants officially let Landon Collins hit the market. Tyrann Mathieu and LaMarcus Joyner are also available. Like Weddle, Mathieu and Joyner are versatile enough to play back deep or in the box. And, unlike Weddle, both can slide down and cover the slot. Also, there\u2019s Adrian Amos, who played in a disguise-heavy scheme in Chicago. The physically gifted Ha-Ha Clinton-Dix is also a disguise player (though some of that\u2019s by accident, as he\u2019s mastered the art of wandering out of position\u2014still, Clinton-Dix is talented). There\u2019s also Earl Thomas, who can drop into the box but is more of a pure centerfielder. Stylistically, Thomas is still the closest thing the NFL has had to Ed Reed since Ed Reed himself. One imagines the Ravens, especially, can appreciate that.\nBy releasing Weddle, most likely the Ravens are not trying to save money at safety, they\u2019re priming to spend money there long-term (not unlike they did when signing Weddle\u2019s sidekick and close friend, Tony Jefferson, two years ago). Any of the safeties listed above can be inked to five-year deals. (Yes, even Thomas, who will only be 30 on Opening Day.) Those safeties will also get up to speed quickly, since they have meaningful NFL experience and will be playing for defensive coordinator Wink Martindale, whom Ravens coaches say is one of the best teachers they\u2019ve ever seen.\nAs for Weddle himself, the question is, Where will he play in 2019? His weaknesses are now an issue. As several coaches explained, Weddle\u2019s game is built on smoke and mirrors. He wins by playing with crafty leverage. He can no longer survive in man-to-man or be fully trusted in space. Baltimore\u2019s uniquely aggressive scheme hid these flaws while accentuating his strengths. That would not be the case in a traditional scheme.\nThis might be why Weddle said two months ago, via the Baltimore Sun, \u201cIf [the Ravens] want to go in a different direction, I\u2019m not going to play for another team. That\u2019s not where I\u2019m at in my career.\u201d He has since changed his mind.\nSo where would he play in 2019? The same rich safety free agent class that got him released in Baltimore will suppress his value on the open market. What might help his value is that more and more teams are playing with three safeties instead of just two.\nBefore joining Baltimore, Weddle reportedly almost signed in New England, and Greg Bedard of the Boston Sports Journal has suggested that would be a good marriage. Contrary to popular belief, New England\u2019s D is not immensely complex or aggressive like Baltimore\u2019s. The Patriots blitz sparingly and their coverage disguises ask players to cover small bits of ground, not large swaths of field. But the Patriots do put their safeties in favorable position, often aligning one in deep centerfield and the other over the middle, where he\u2019s a free help defender or QB-reader. That type of role plays to Weddle\u2019s football IQ and masks his limitations.\nOther teams that could use and could fit Weddle include:\nGiants: Weddle would be a cheap replacement for Landon Collins. Their defensive coordinator, James Bettcher, is perhaps football\u2019s most aggressive blitz designer, with most of those blitzes being built on disguise.\nBears: The last thing a Super Bowl-caliber defense wants is a glaring hole, which is what the Bears face at safety if Adrian Amos is not re-signed. If new coordinator Chuck Pagano stays close to what predecessor Vic Fangio did, Weddle could be hidden by a scheme that hinges on two-deep match-zone principles, where defensive backs almost always have some sort of help in coverage.\nBroncos: Fangio will be running his scheme in Denver (obviously). The Broncos believe their defense alone can make a deep playoff push now\u2014that\u2019s why John Elway hired a 60-year-old head coach and traded for a veteran starting quarterback in Joe Flacco. The biggest key to Fangio\u2019s scheme is the subtly of its coverage disguises. Those disguise tactics aren\u2019t easy to learn\u2026 unless you\u2019re Eric Weddle.\nLions: Matt Patricia is running the 200-level version of New England\u2019s scheme. Weddle could help push the D to level 300 or 400.\nBucs: New defensive coordinator Todd Bowles plays the way Bettcher plays with the Giants. Tampa Bay\u2019s incumbent safeties are so-so. Bowles might want more athleticism here, but we\u2019ve seen a hundred coaches in his position before eventually say, \u201cScrew it, just give me a guy who knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\nSteelers: Because they\u2019re so weak at linebacker, they badly want a dime safety who can play in the box, allowing either Jon Bostic or Vince Williams to leave the field. Ex-Packer Morgan Burnett can be that guy, but injuries made him a week-to-week mystery last year. Weddle isn\u2019t a box player, but second-year safety Terrell Edmunds could slide there, with Weddle playing back deep. Plus, the Steelers wouldn\u2019t mind a veteran who has intimate knowledge of their rival Ravens.\nTitans: They\u2019re coached by Weddle\u2019s former Ravens defensive coordinator, Dean Pees, and they\u2019ll be looking for safety help with Jonathan Cyprien soon to be released and Kenny Vaccaro a free agent.\nAll of these teams need the type of immediate help at safety that Weddle can provide. It will be fascinating to see how this market play out.\n\u2022 Question or comment? Email us at talkback@themmqb.com."

            "Half of our long national nightmare is over. Manny Machado, one of the two top prizes on baseball\u2019s free agent market, has signed, and with a somewhat surprising team. Machado landed with the San Diego Padres for an eye-popping $300 million over 10 years. The contract, which was finalized on Thursday, includes an opt-out clause after 2023.\nTerms of the deal were first reported by per Jeff Passan of ESPN and Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic.\nSure, it took until after spring training camps opened throughout baseball for Machado to sign a deal, but the wait it appears was worth it. At $300 million, Machado has the largest free agent deal in baseball history, surpassing the $275 million over 10 years that Alex Rodriguez got from the Yankees after 2007, when MLB\u2019s annual revenue was reported at $6 billion.\nIn 2018, MLB had reported revenues of $10.3 billion, per Forbes.\nThe only contract larger than Machado\u2019s in baseball is the $325 million deal signed by Giancarlo Stanton with the Marlins, though that was a 13-year pact, and one signed before Stanton reached free agency.\nBryce Harper is the other top prize on the market and may or may not surpass $300 million, but for now Machado owns the top free agent contract ever in the sport, which surprisingly puts the Padres in rarefied air.\nEric Hosmer last winter signed an eight-year deal with San Diego for $144 million, giving the Padres for the moment the highest total free agent contracts for two years running. It didn\u2019t work out in 2018 for the Padres, who lost 96 games. San Diego hasn\u2019t had a winning season since 2010, and has averaged a shade under 90 losses in the eight years since.\nBefore Machado the Padres had a payroll of just $80 million for 2019 per Cot\u2019s Contracts, meaning they had plenty of room to add, and frankly still do even after Machado. Maybe if they add some pitching \u2014 Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel are still free agents, after all \u2014 San Diego might accelerate their success even faster.\nBut Hosmer, like Machado, is a long-term play for the Padres, who have one of the most impressive arrays of young talent in the game.\nFernando Tatis Jr. is either the best, second-best or third-best prospect in all of baseball, depending on your national list of choice, a shortstop who figures to reach the big leagues as soon as 2019. Tatis hit .286/.355/.507 with 42 extra-base hits in 88 games in Double-A last year, and he turned just 20 in January. Tatis is one of a whopping eight consensus top-100 prospects in baseball for the Padres, who have three other players who also show up on various national lists.\nPadres top 100 prospects Player Pos 2019 age Baseball America Baseball Prospectus ESPN FanGraphs MLB Pipeline Player Pos 2019 age Baseball America Baseball Prospectus ESPN FanGraphs MLB Pipeline Fernando Tatis Jr. SS 20 2 3 1 3 2 MacKenzie Gore LHP 20 28 28 7 22 15 Luis Urias 2B 22 31 17 56 24 23 Francisco Mejia C 23 32 20 29 59 26 Chris Paddack RHP 23 66 37 44 34 34 Adrian Morejon LHP 20 52 72 46 86 49 Luis Patino RHP 19 67 74 50 42 48 Logan Allen LHP 22 92 84 80 93 74 Michel Baez RHP 23 85 72 Ryan Weathers LHP 19 93 Josh Naylor 1B 22 99\nSan Diego\u2019s prospect capital is so robust, agent Scott Boras last winter called it \u201ca volcano of hot-talent lava.\u201d\n\u201cManny is one of the truly elite players in baseball and impacts the game on both sides of the ball,\u201d Padres general manager A.J. Preller said. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent the last several years building a foundation of talent throughout our system that allows us to make a landmark signing such as this.\u201d\nPretty soon several of these players will be in the majors, and the Padres\u2019 fortunes will turn. Now they get to join a team with a superstar in his prime in Machado.\nMachado gives the Padres a true impact bat in the middle of their lineup, and one who is still just 26 years old. Machado hit .297/.367/.538 with the Orioles and Dodgers in 2018, and his 37 home runs gave him four straight years with at least 33 home runs.\nWhether he plays shortstop or third base in San Diego, Machado will be a huge upgrade. Padres shortstops hit .241/.293/.375, an 82 wRC+ in 2018, ranking 24th in MLB. San Diego third baseman hit .231/.299/.409, a 94 wRC+ that ranked 19th. Machado had a 141 wRC+ last year, and is at 120 for his career.\nMachado will still be in his prime when San Diego starts getting good again, which makes this a perfect fit. Adding great players is never a bad strategy."

The hurricane center said the storm could produce rain accumulations of 2 to 4 inches across the Florida Keys through Monday and could become a hurricane by Monday night or Tuesday.\nGov. Rick Scott issued a state of emergency for 26 counties in the Florida Panhandle and the Big Bend area, where winds in those areas could reach more than 100 mph. Scott said the storm could turn into a Category 2 hurricane by the time it makes landfall midweek.\nScott activated 500 National Guard troops to help with planning ahead of the storm. Another 5,500 were available if needed.\n\"This storm will be life-threatening and extremely dangerous,\" Scott said in a briefing Sunday. \"Every family must be prepared.\"\nA tropical storm warning is in effect for the Cuban provinces of Pinar del Rio and the Isle of Youth. There's also a warning in effect for the coast of Mexico from Tulum to Cabo Catoche. The storm could bring rainfall totals of 3 to 7 inches over western Cuba and 2 to 4 inches over the Yucatan Peninsula and Belize through Tuesday.\nThis image shows the projected path of Tropical Storm Michael on Sun., Oct. 7, 2018. NHC\nThe storm was located 105 miles southeast of Cozumel, Mexico, and had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, moving north-northeast at 3 mph, the NHC said in its 8 p.m. ET advisory. Michael's center will move over the Yucatan Channel on Monday and then across the eastern Gulf of Mexico late Monday through Tuesday night, and approach the northeastern Gulf coast Wednesday.\nPeter Martinez contributed to this report."

Protagonist Claire (played by Caitriona Balfe), an English nurse living in the 1940s, has earned fans' hearts for her self-reliance and outspoken nature, which both helps and gets her in trouble when she's thrust backwards in time to the 18th century. (It's kind of a long story, and involves magical stones, if you must know.) Unfortunately, that puts her right in the midst of a fomenting Scottish rebellion against English rule. That's where she meets Jamie, an extremely good-looking Highlander, and they fall in love.\nMore From ELLE\nNetflix will be streaming the first two seasons of the show, which has proven addictive (just ask its legions of fans) for its time-jumping drama, gutsy heroine, and\u2014it has to be said\u2014passionate sex scenes.

            "FC Barcelona will play the first ever La Liga game on foreign soil on January 26th at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami at 2:45 p.m., local time, according to a leaked document obtained by COPE. Bar\u00e7a will play against Girona, who will sacrifice a home match.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for LaLiga to build bridges and grow, transmitting the values of football and Spain all over the world,\u201d the document reads. \u201cOutside of Spain, the United States is one of the countries with the most fans of LaLiga and its clubs, where we count with millions of fans.\u201d\nIt goes on to say: \u201cSeeking to bring Spanish football and La Liga closer to these fans represents an enormous opportunity to connect with said fans and continue working for the global following of our league at international level.\u201d\nThe proposal has generated controversy among the players, coaches, and local fans. It was reported that Girona season-ticket holders would be refunded for their flights to and from Miami, to make up for the fact that they won\u2019t get a match at their stadium.\nThe effects of a transatlantic voyage, followed by a top-level match, and then another transatlantic voyage, could also be a source of troublele for the players. Also, La Liga is yet to ratify the plan with FIFA in an official capacity. The organization has previously shut down attempts to play matches in other countries.\nThere\u2019s also the pesky matter of La Liga not being shown in many TV sets around the United States.\nOn the other hand, La Liga says this is a \u201cperfect\u201d opportunity to grow the popularity of the league abroad. It certainly would be groundbreaking, as none of the top five European leagues have played a competitive league match outside of the country. Spain already tested the waters this season, holding the Spanish Supercup (which Barcelona also played) in Morocco.\nSome fans have railed against the move on social media, but some Girona fans have said that with the included flight to Miami, they are getting a good deal.\nMeanwhile, La Liga will reportedly ban political demonstrations at the match and pass out free Spanish flags. This is because both teams are from Catalonia, and it would be a logical time for those fans in favor of an independent Catalonia to make a political stand during the match."

            "SONY fans have a slew of PlayStation 4 exclusive games to look forward to, and many were shown off at this week's E3 gaming convention.\nWe've tracked down the hottest PS4 exclusives announced at E3 2018 that'll definitely make your Xbox pals jealous. Here's the full list...\nLast of Us Part Two E3 gameplay reveal goes from sweet embrace to bloody death in the blink of an eye\nThe Last of Us 2\nBy far the biggest announcement from Sony at E3 2018 was the gameplay reveal for The Last of Us Part II.\nIt's the long-awaited sequel to the post-apocalyptic 2013 hit, The Last of Us, and looks set to be even more brutal than the original.\nThe trailer shows off lots of gruesome gameplay, right in the middle of a tender kiss scene that's among the most well-done we've ever seen in a games, but that has stirred up some ire online.\nDeath Stranding\nThe first proper trailer for the mysterious Death Stranding game has appeared, and we're still not entirely sure what it's about.\nThe game, which is helmed by Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima, stars exceptionally well motion-captured actors like Norman Reedus and Mads Mikkelsen, but sadly the plot largely remains a mystery.\nWorse still, there's no word on a release date, so Kojima fans may have another few years of patient waiting before getting their hands on the game.\nNioh 2\nSony also showed off a very short trailer for Nioh 2, which gave very little away.\nWe know it's a sequel to 2017's Nioh, an action RPG that involved navigating through different dungeon-style levels and defeating monsters.\nFrom the trailer, it appears as though Nioh 2 will follow a similar format \u2013 exploring and battling demons.\nThere's zero information on release date however, and it's also not 100% confirmed as a PS4 console exclusive (even though the original Nioh was).\nGhost of Tsushima\nThis epic-looking game is set in 1274, during the Mongol Empire's invasion of Japan, starting with the island of Tsushima.\nThe island's legendary samurai defenders are slaughtered during the invasion except for Jin Sakai, a noble samurai that survives the cull.\nIt's an open-world game from Sucker Punch, the makers of InFamous, which forces the player, as Jin, to reject their samurai ideals to save their homeland from foreign invaders.\nThere's no release date just yet, but the nine-minute trailer should give you plenty to chew over.\nMarvel's Spider-Man\nThis PS4 game hardly needs an introduction: it's a good old-fashioned Spider-Man game, with web-swinging and baddie-battling galore.\nIt follows superhero legend Peter Parker as a seasoned crime-fighter, keeping the streets of New York City clean.\nThe gameplay looks inspired by Rocksteady's Arkham series of Batman games -- and that is definitely no bad thing.\nSony confirmed that the game would arrive on September 7, 2018, and showed off seven minutes of previously unseen gameplay footage to boot.\nD\u00e9racin\u00e9\nThis is actually a PlayStation VR exclusive, so you'll need to own a PSVR headset to play it.\nWe don't know much about the game yet, other than the fact that it's called D\u00e9racin\u00e9, and it'll be playable in virtual reality.\nD\u00e9racin\u00e9 is the French word for \"uprooted\", and we know the game is set in a stately home that doubles up as a boarding school.\nWe also catch a glimpse of a blonde girl staring out of a window, arguably looking a little forlorn.\nThe game's spooky description explains: \"As a spirit summoned by a young girl in a secluded boarding school, the player must prove its existence and build a unique bond with the students through clever interactions.\n\"As the mystery of the storey unfolds, the spirit must use its ability to manipulate the forces of life and time to change the fate of the pupils.\"\nComing 2018, folks.\nTetris coming to PlayStation VR in trippy take on the ultimate old-school classic\nTetris Effect\nThis was announced just before E3 and shown off for the first time at the show\nIt comes from the revered Tetsuya Mizuguchi, and can be played in VR as well as on a normal telly.\nIt's got Tetris at its core, surrounded by the sort of immersive musical weirdness you'd expect from the brain behind Rez and Child of Eden.\nWeird, utterly engaging and with one of the greatest, simplest games of all time at its core, it's definitely one to watch out for when it comes out this autumn.\nThere are whole host of others too.... so which game from this list or that we've missed are you most excited to play?

In a new seven-round mock draft by Luke Easterling at Draft Wire, the team uses four of its draft picks on defensive prospects, addressing needs at all three levels of the defense.\nHere\u2019s a look at who he has the Panthers selecting with each of their six draft picks this year.\nNo. 16: Montez Sweat \u2013 Mississippi State DE\nThe Panthers finished the 2018 season with just 35 sacks and Mario Addison accounted for nine of them. That means even if Julius Peppers comes back for one more round, the team desperately needs to add more talent on the edge. Sweat (6-foot-6, 245 pounds) was a standout during Senior Bowl week and posted 22.5 sacks and 30 tackles for a loss over the last two seasons with Mississippi State."

            "Credit: Epic / Erik Kain\nWe are fully halfway through Fortnite: Battle Royale's fifth season. The Season 5, Week 5 challenges have been revealed and there will be blood.\nNamely, there will be blood spilled at Lazy Links, where players are tasked with teeing off on five different greens. From eliminations in Shifty Shafts to chest searching in Junk Junction, here are this week's Free and Battle Pass challenges.\nRemember, solving all of these will unlock a secret loading screen, leading you to the 10-point Road Trip Battle Star.\nFree Challenges\nSearch Chests In Junk Junction (0/7)\nUse Rift Portals (0/3)\nEliminate Opponents in a Single Match (HARD) (0/3)\nBattle Pass Challenges\nCredit: Epic Games\nSearch Chests In Junk Junction\nJunk Junction has a number of pretty easily accessible chests and it's not as central as Loot Lake or some of the other locations we've had chest-hunts this season, so it shouldn't be quite as dangerous. You'll find some spawns on top of heaps of cars. Others will spawn in buildings around the area. All the chests in this area are potential spawns, not guarantees.\nCentral Junk Junction: 1 chest spawn\nOn the second floor of the main building in the Junk Junction behind a crate in the room with the black-and-white checkers.\nWestern Junk Junction: 3 chest spawns\nWest of Junk Junction by the western entrance.\nNorthwest of the area on top of some compacted cars.\nOutside the western fence behind the brick wall next to an ice cream truck.\nSouthern Junk Junction: 3 chest spawns\nOn the south-side of the big main building there's an attic room with a possible chest.\nSouth of Junk Junction at the foot of a stack of cars behind a metal fence.\nSouthwest on top of the large bank of compacted cars you can find a chest.\nUse Rift Portals\nRift portals are randomly spawned but do tend to show up in certain locations more than others. Particularly in locations impacted by the Season 5 changes like the desert area and Paradise Palms; the Durr Burger hill in the northwest section of the map; and in Viking Village.\nEliminate Opponents in a Single Match / Shifty Shafts / Deal Damage\nMight as well get both of these at once. Head to Shifty and take out three opponents in a single match and you'll get a two-for-one. Or, if you're more devious, load up a Solo match and go camp at Lazy Links. That's where your enemies will be shooting holes of golf. Let them take the shot (it's the polite thing to do) but then you should have some easy pickings.\nAnd hey, if you can get some of these eliminations with a Clinger, Stink Bomb or Grenade, you can wipe out three challenges in fairly short order.\nThat's all for week 5. Check out previous Season 5 weeks and the solutions to those challenges below."

            "SANTA ANA, Calif. -- Dashcam video shows a twin-engine Cessna as it fell from the sky, head first, around 12:30 p.m. Sunday. None of the five people on board survived.\n\"It just banked, he turned and it just came straight down,\" witness Alex Perkins said.\nThe victims all worked for a Northern California real estate consulting firm and were on their way to a real estate conference in Orange County, reports CBS News correspondent Mireya Villarreal. Some of them were related to each other. It happened on a busy weekend shopping day in a highly-traveled retail area with a large mall just a block away.\nCellphone video shows the chaotic scene just after the plane crashed in an Orange County parking lot, smashing into a car. The car was unoccupied.\n\"Fortunately, that person was inside the store shopping at the time of impact,\" Orange County Fire Authority's Tony Bommarito said.\nNearby shoppers said the fixed-wing aircraft made a sputtering noise as it dropped head-first to the ground. The FAA said the pilot, identified as Scott Shepherd, declared an emergency just before the crash.\nJohn Brewer\nShepherd was the owner of a San Francisco real estate consulting firm, Category III Aviation Corp. The coroner identified the other victims as Lara Shepherd, Floria and Navid Hakimi, and Nasim Ghanadan. The plane had taken off from Concord, heading for John Wayne Airport in Santa Ana just about one mile from the crash site. Floria posted a photo to Instagram about two hours before the crash with the caption, \"Flying out to LA.\" The plane she was boarding appears to have the same markings as the one that crashed.\n\"It does look like it came down pretty abruptly,\" Bommarito said, adding, \"There's a small impact zone.\"\nFederal investigators are now trying to determine why the plane went down so close to its final destination.\n\"I don't know anything about what this pilot did or what he was thinking but it could have been much more tragic ... The fact that there was no injuries on ground is a miracle in itself,\" Bommarito said.\nThe pilot had many years of experience. According to a records search, his license was renewed last year."

            "Ariana Grande is mourning the death of her late ex-boyfriend, Mac Miller.\nOne day after the 26-year-old rapper was pronounced dead from an apparent overdose, Grande, 25, shared a black-and-white photograph of her former boyfriend via Instagram on Saturday.\nIn the picture, Miller stares up at the camera while sitting on the grass. A pair of tennis shoes, presumably Grande\u2019s, can be seen between his legs.\nChoosing to let the image speak for itself, Grande shared the image without a caption.\nThe \u201cGod Is a Woman\u201d singer disabled comments on the social media platform after some fans began to blame her for Miller\u2019s death on Friday.\nMiller, whose real name was Malcolm McCormick, was pronounced dead at 11:51 a.m. at his Studio City, California, home on Friday, the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner confirmed in a statement to PEOPLE.\nA cause of death is yet to be determined, but a source told PEOPLE that Miller had gone into cardiac arrest after appearing to suffer a drug overdose.\nJamie McCarthy/Getty. Jamie McCarthy/Getty\nMinutes before Grande broke her silence on Miller\u2019s death, the rapper\u2019s mother Karen Meyers also shared a photograph of her smiling son learning his head against her while they enjoyed a baseball game together.\nShe captioned the image with a broken-heart emoji.\nFollowing Miller\u2019s death, his family released a statement thanking everybody for their \u201cprayers.\u201d\n\u201cMalcolm McCormick, known and adored by fans as Mac Miller, has tragically passed away at the age of 26,\u201d they said in a statement provided to PEOPLE. \u201cHe was a bright light in this world for his family, friends and fans. Thank you for your prayers. Please respect our privacy. There are no further details as to the cause of his death at this time.\u201d\nThe rapper\u2019s tragic death comes months after PEOPLE confirmed his split from Grande in May.\n\u201cAriana and Mac officially broke up right after Coachella weekend, but they ultimately struggled for a long time with their relationship, and it was basically over last year,\u201d a source previously told PEOPLE.\nAfter online trolls blamed her for Miller\u2019s untimely death on Friday, a source told PEOPLE that the rapper had moved on from their relationship.\n\u201cIt honestly seemed he was over the Ariana situation,\u201d the source said, adding that Miller had said at one point, \u201cI\u2019ve matured and my ex hasn\u2019t.\u201d\nDavid X Prutting/BFA/REX/Shutterstock\nGrande and Miller first went public with their relationship in September 2016 \u2014 three years after they collaborated on her hit single \u201cThe Way.\u201d\nRELATED VIDEO: LISTEN: Mac Miller Was Working on Music Hours Before His Death\n\u201cThis is one of my best friends in the whole world and favorite people on the planet,\u201d she wrote of Miller in an Instagram Story days after their breakup in May. \u201cI respect and adore him endlessly and am grateful to have him in my life in any form, at all times regardless of how our relationship changes or what the universe holds for each of us!\u201d\nShortly after their breakup, Grande began dating Pete Davidson, to whom she became engaged in June.\nJeff Kravitz/FilmMagic\nIn July, Miller opened up about his past relationship with Grande during an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1 on Apple Music and explained that they had both moved on since their split.\n\u201cI was in love with somebody. We were together for two years. We worked through good times, bad times, stress and everything else. And then it came to an end and we both moved on. And it\u2019s that simple,\u201d he said.\nMiller also went on to add that while some fans have assumed he\u2019d \u201cbeen on the Internet\u201d following up on his ex\u2019s every move after the news of her whirlwind romance with fianc\u00e9 Davidson, that wasn\u2019t the case.\nExplaining why he\u2019d taken a step back from things, the rapper remarked that not only was he about to drop his new album, \u201cIt just all seemed kind of unimportant you know \u2014 the need to show people I was OK.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all positive energy,\u201d he added. \u201cI am happy for her and [the fact that she\u2019s] moving forward with her life, just as I\u2019m sure she is with me.\u201d\n\u201cIt honestly seemed he was over the Ariana situation,\u201d the source reveals, adding that Miller had said at one point, \u201cI\u2019ve matured and my ex hasn\u2019t.\u201d\nIf you or someone you know is in need of help, please contact the SAMHSA substance abuse helpline at 1-800-662-HELP."

            "A Canadian rapper fell to his death from the wing of an airplane Saturday when a music video stunt went wrong. The Canadian Press reports that 34-year-old Calgary native Jon James McMurray, who performed under the name Jon James, was walking on the wing of a small Cessna when the plane went into a downward spiral. McMurray was found dead in a field near Westwold, British Columbia.\nA statement from McMurray\u2019s management details what happened:\nHe died filming for a project he had been working on for months. His final act included performing an airplane stunt that included rapping while walking on the wing. He had trained intensely for the stunt, however, as Jon got further out onto the wing of the plane, it caused the small Cessna to go into a downward spiral that the pilot couldn\u2019t correct. Jon held onto the wing until it was too late, and by the time he let go, he didn\u2019t have time to pull his chute. He impacted and died instantly.\nMcMurray, who was based in Los Angeles, was a former professional skier who switched to music after suffering career-ending injuries including a broken back and shattered heel. Before taking up rapping, he performed in a rock band. He often performed stunts in his videos, such as the gymnastics move he pulls in the opening seconds of his recent \u201cI Am\u201d video. He performed at events including the Canadian music and extreme sports festival Center Of Gravity and recently collaborated with Riff Raff on a song called \u201cThe Man,\u201d which appears to be the song he was filming a video for. A clip posted on his Instagram three weeks ago previews the making of the video."

            "Through the looking glass: The Boeing Airpower Teaming System provides an early glimpse at the future of warfare in which opposing sides battle it out remotely. Weapons like this are also cheaper and safer to operate, allowing forces to maximize their resources.\nBoeing on Wednesday revealed its latest aerial platform, the Boeing Airpower Teaming System. The jet-like aircraft was designed to fly solo, unmanned missions or alongside existing military aircraft in a support role at a fraction of the cost associated with traditional fighter jets.\nThe Boeing Airpower Teaming System measures 38 feet long with a range of more than 2,000 nautical miles. Boeing said the craft can be loaded with onboard sensors to support intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions and electronic warfare.\nKristin Robertson, vice president and general manager of Boeing Autonomous Systems, said the company's latest will \"truly be a force multiplier as it protects and projects air power.\"\nDeveloped by Boeing Australia, the project is the company's largest investment in a new unmanned aircraft program outside the US.\nUnmanned aircraft afford a number of advantages over human-piloted fighter jets. Humans, for example, can only be exposed to a limited number of Gs, fly for a set number of hours and process data so quickly. Autonomous aircraft wouldn't be limited by such factors.\nBoeing said the first test flight is planned for 2020."

            "Every great Patriots Super Bowl run needs a great Patriots controversy. Spygate. Deflategate. Mascotgate (ft. Jamal Adams). The latest thing is the stupidest thing, with Jets safety Jamal Adams tackling Pat the Patriot and the joking about sending him to the hospital.\nThis is very 2019 and very annoying: Adams was at the Pro Bowl and was signing autographs for fans when he decided to take off sprinting down the sideline of the field and tackle the Patriots mascot. Adams delivered a form tackle, knocking the mascot to the ground in what appeared to be a pretty hysterical encounter, because everyone was fine.\nBut then Adams told multiple reporters that he was being harassed by the NFL about the guy in the costume being taken to the hospital, which was a little bit more concerning!\nTurns out he may have been joking -- which would be a weird thing to joke about, but whatever -- because a Patriots spokesman told Mark Daniels of the Providence Journal that the mascot \"was not hospitalized.\"\nI'm not going to sit here and get outraged over this, even if I feel a little duped for writing a story about the Pats mascot being hospitalized because of what Adams told multiple reporters.\nHere are two actual quotes:\n\"All jokes aside, I didn't hit him that hard,\" Adams said. \"I don't know what's really going on, but they did tell me he's in the hospital.\" \"They're not happy with me right now. The NFL is calling my phone, blowing me up, saying that I put him in the hospital so I gotta go check on him, make sure he's OK,\" Adams said.\nYou can't say that stuff and then be mad that people ran with a story. You can't claim \"fake news\" when you're the one propagating a story.\nAnyway, here's hoping that Pat the Patriot is fine and healthy and ready to go for the Super Bowl and no one is in the hospital for being blindsided at the Pro Bowl by a much bigger human and that Adams can now spend his free time focusing in on tackling people who deserve to be tackled.\nIf you still haven't marked your calendar for the Super Bowl, the game will be kicking off from Atlanta on Feb. 3 and will be televised by CBS and you can stream it right here. If you're thinking about buying a new TV for the big game, CNET has you covered. They shared their best picks for every budget."

            "Senator Lindsey Graham was close with John McCain for many, many years, and today Graham delivered a heartfelt, emotional speech on the Senate floor this afternoon paying tribute to his friend.\nGraham talked about McCain\u2019s sense of humor and some of the jokes he shared over the years, including how Arizona is the once place where \u201cmothers tell their children you can never grow up to be president.\u201d\n\u201cI am gonna miss these dumb jokes,\u201d he said.\nHe reflected on everything he learned from McCain, including witnessing how \u201cthe captured warrior who was tortured became the statesman who forgave and healed.\u201d\n\u201cI remember him embracing a war that nobody wanted to talk about because he understood what it would cost to lose it,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember him supporting the surge when everybody was willing to get out of Iraq because they were so tired of it and saw no way forward. I remember the fighter.\u201d\nGraham spoke of McCain as a healer and unifier who was graceful in defeat and accepting of failures before continuing:\n\u201cTo those striving as a young person, remember John McCain. He failed a lot, but he never quit and the reason we\u2019re talking about him today and the reason I\u2019m crying is because he was successful. In spite of his failures. For family and friends, the after action report would say a relationship with Maverick brought joy and difficulty. Both were your constant companion. He was a difficult man. He could be tough. But the joy that you received from being with him will sustain you for a lifetime. And I am so lucky to have been in his presence.\u201d\nHe even said at one point that people should try to follow in his footsteps, saying, \u201cBe more like John McCain. I believe there\u2019s a little John McCain in all of us. And a little John McCain practiced by a lot of people can make this a really great nation.\u201d\nYou can watch above, via CBS.\n[image via screengrab]\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com"

            "A week is a very long time in football.\nThis time last week, the Blues were licking their wounds after forgetting how to win on the Gold Coast.\nBut after yet another week of forensic examination, both inside and outside Princes Park, Carlton has finally won a game \u2014 and they couldn\u2019t have been more impressive at Marvel Stadium on Easter Sunday.\nStream Western Bulldogs v Carlton on KAYO SPORTS. Live & anytime in HD. Get your 14-day free trial and start streaming instantly >\nCarlton burst out of the blocks against Western Bulldogs before leading from start to finish to win their first game since Round 19 last year \u2014 267 days ago \u2014 by 44 points.\nFittingly it was No. 1 draft pick Sam Walsh who slammed home a goal right on the final siren to break the Blues\u2019 60-game drought without a three figure score.\nAfter winning only two games during a disastrous 2018, this was a win to savour for Carlton and Brendon Bolton, who has been under more pressure than any other man in football this season.\nIt might have been all about the showdown between Brownlow Medal favourites Patrick Cripps and Marcus Bontempelli before the opening bounce, but it was all about the Carlton skipper and young gun Sam Petrevski-Seton by the final siren.\nCripps continued to show why he is considered by some as the best player in the game right now, while Petrevski-Seton played like the two-time Brownlow medallist who he inherited the iconic No. 5 from.\nThe West Australian duo tore the Western Bulldogs apart in the opening half, amassing 51 disposals between them before Cripps finished with 37 and Petrevski-Seton 35.\nIt was almost as stunning as the result.\nSam Petrevski-Seton played his best game in the navy blue against the Bulldogs.

Source: Getty Images\nBut it didn\u2019t come without a period of unease for long-suffering Carlton supporters.\nA sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu swept through Marvel Stadium in the third quarter.\nAfter coughing up a three-goal lead in a low scoring affair at Metricon Stadium last weekend, lightning looked like it might strike twice on Sunday.\nBilly Gowers had two shots at goal \u2014 and missed both \u2014 before Sam Lloyd and Tory Dickson reduced the margin to three goals and the Dogs had all the momentum.\nBut then Petreveski-Seton \u2014 the man of the moment \u2014 intercepted a switch kick from Caleb Daniel just inside the arc. He went back and added another layer to the best day of his football life.\n\u201cPS, this is a big kick,\u201d North Melbourne legend Wayne Carey said on Triple M.\n\u201cThat is a clutch kick from Sam Petreveski-Seton,\u201d North Melbourne and Sydney great Wayne Schwass added.\nThe Halls Creek product wasn\u2019t the only green shoot who delivered when they needed it most on Sunday.\nWith Carlton\u2019s great white hope Charlie Curnow forced to withdrawal before the opening bounce due to another issue with his knee, Harry McKay showed why he was taken at Pick 10 in the 2015 National Draft.\nMcKay terrorised the Western Bulldogs\u2019 undersized defence. He kicked goals \u2014 slotting an equal career-high four goals \u2014 and he took big marks \u2014 reeling in\n\u201cThey say they take long for big guys \u2026 but let\u2019s hope this is the year where McKay completely breaks out and comes a consistent key position performer,\u201d Jason Dunstall said on Fox Footy.\nGet the ultimate AFL experience on your phone with the FOX FOOTY App. Download it NOW for FREE on iOS and Android!\nHarry McKay booted four goals for Carlton. Photo: Julian Smith/AAP Image. Source: AAP\n\u201cHe is just improving, each and every week. He could be a phenomena inside that forward line. He\u2019s just a brilliant kick, he\u2019s more skilled than people have given him credit for,\u201d Gerard Healy added.\nOn a weekend where St Kilda moved to the top of the ladder, where Port Adelaide stunned West Coast and Fremantle upset Greater Western Sydney, this wasn\u2019t the biggest shock, but it will be the story to emerge from the Easter weekend.\nAnd in case the 22 in navy blue had forgotten how to sing the song, Carlton supporters started screaming out the lyrics in the dying moments, in another moment to savour.\nSILVAGNI RETURN\nJack Silvagni, the son of Carlton legend and list manager Stephen Silvagni, hadn\u2019t had a look in across the first month of the season, following a patchy 2018. But on Sunday afternoon, Silvagni showed he still has plenty to offer at AFL level. After being played here, there and everywhere last year, he played in attack against the Western Bulldogs, where he finished with 18 disposals, nine marks, four assists and a goal.\nHAYES DEBUT\nIt took Will Hayes five years on Footscray\u2019s VFL list to finally get a crack on the Western Bulldogs\u2019 list. But it only took him two hours to show why he belongs at this level. The son of champion horse trainer David Hayes racked up nine touches in the opening quarter alone, before finishing with 21 for the day in a bright debut.\nSHOWING THE LOVE\nCarlton supporters erupted midway through the second quarter when Brendon Bolton ran down the boundary line, flanked by two bald, unathletic security guards who looked like the muscle men out of Ocean\u2019s Eleven. They then stood as one and cheered the Blues off the ground at half-time. That themed continued across the second half, especially when Carlton looked home in the last quarter. They started singing the song at the 18-minute mark of the final term and some were still singing it long after the crowd dispersed.\nRe-live Western Bulldogs v Carlton in our live blog below.\nIf you can\u2019t see the blog, tap here."

We spent a lot of money putting things together.\n\"Thing is, they don't pay to use your venue, they just expect it and in return, you get the publicity.\n\"The event was meant to be next week, and we finally got confirmation a couple of days ago. But it wasn't a statement or anything, literally just a phone call and that was it.\n\"They said the X-Factor is 'not being aired, there won't be any auditions', nothing at all. It's been pulled.\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will auto-play soon 8 Cancel Play now\n\"They said Simon Cowell has other ideas, like a winner of winners competition, or a celebrity version of the show.\n\"But all auditions across the country have been cancelled at the last minute while they decide what they are doing with it.\n\"Sad thing is, everyone who agreed to do this will have lost out in some way, shape or form.\n\"And there still hasn't been an official statement from them, or even a press release. We've had no guidance on what to say. And heard nothing since they hung up the phone.\"\nImage: PA) PA)\nSimon has spoken about his grand plan to get viewers back by having two bold new versions of the X Factor format.\nCowell told The Sun: \"I've had a meeting with ITV, I've told them what I think we'd like to do with X Factor because we've been waiting to have this opportunity.\n\"The time feels right, and it will be a huge change.\n\"We haven't exactly confirmed the dates or the order of the shows, but essentially there are going to be two versions of X Factor running this year.\"\nImage: ITV) ITV)\nThe fate of the judging panel has yet to be confirmed after Robbie Williams, Ayda Williams and Louis Tomlinson were introduced last year.\nOne Direction star Louis has already admitted he doesn't know if he will return amid the planned shake-up.\nHe reportedly threatened to quit, insisting that the singing contest should be for the public.\nImage: ITV) ITV)\nThose hoping to become the next Leona Lewis, Olly Murs or One Direction may have to audition for Britain's Got Talent instead.\nThere's also plans to bring a revamped BGT to the screens as well as Cowell goes on the offensive to reassert his show on the TV schedules.\nThe music mogul reportedly wants to create a second series of Britain's Got Talent with past winners of the show competing against each other, along with the main series, which is currently in production.\nThe Mirror has approached ITV for comment.\nDo you have a story to sell?

            "Pope Francis said he is opposed to the idea of optional priestly celibacy, insisting that celibacy is a gift to the Church.\n\u201cI am reminded of that saying from St. Paul VI: \u2018I would sooner give my life before changing the law of celibacy,\u2019\u201d the pope told journalists aboard the papal plane returning to Rome from Panama on Monday.\n\u201cThis came to my mind and I want to say it because it is a courageous line; he said it in 1968-1970 at a more difficult moment than the present time,\u201d Francis said.\n\u201cPersonally, I think that celibacy is a gift to the Church,\u201d the pope said, \u201cand I do not agree with allowing optional celibacy, no.\u201d\nThe pope did open a slight window by suggesting that in certain \u201cfaraway\u201d places an exception could possible be made for \u201cpastoral\u201d reasons.\n\u201cThere could only be some chance in faraway places, I am thinking of the Pacific Islands, but it is something to think about when there is pastoral necessity. The shepherd must think of the faithful,\u201d he said.\n\u201cMy decision is: no optional celibacy prior to the diaconate,\u201d he said.\nThe pope\u2019s remarks came ahead of an upcoming synod on the pan-Amazon region to be held in the Vatican in October, at which advocates for a relaxation of Church discipline on priestly celibacy are expected to be active.\nPriestly celibacy is a longstanding tradition in the Latin Church, but rare exceptions are made on a case-by-case basis for married ministers who convert to Catholicism and then become priests.\nIn Eastern rite Catholicism, married men may be ordained priests, but men who are ordained when they are single are not permitted to marry later.\nFollow Thomas D.

If Gobert is unable to play, Utah is going to have a very tough time stopping Towns, who is averaging 22.6 points and 12.3 rebounds on the season.\nRudy Gobert is arguably the best defender at the center position in the NBA. The reigning Defensive Player of the Year is averaging 14.9 points, 13.0 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 2.1 blocks per game for the Jazz this season while shooting 64.2 percent from the field and 65.4 percent from the free-throw line.\nUtah enters Friday with a record of 27-22, good for sixth place in the Western Conference standings. If Gobert is out, the Jazz will have to rely on Ekpe Udoh and Derrick Favor to try and contain Towns in the post. Gobert hasn\u2019t missed a game yet this season. He is one of the toughest players in the league, so look for Gobert to try and give it a go on Friday."

This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. You can unsubscribe at any time. More info\nLesnar's advocate Paul Heyman walked out to the ring shortly after Hulk Hogan's surprise appearance and stated that if his client doesn't wrestle in the main event then he will go somewhere where he is more appreciated. The Beast came out to defend RAW's premier title in order to get the night over quickly and Rollins soon followed but fell victim to a brutal assault by the UFC legend. However, the referee was knocked down during the bout and The Kingslayer took advantage of the situation by hitting his opponent with a Low Blow. The Architect then delivered three Curb Stomps to win the Universal Championship and left The Beast, Heyman and the entire MetLife Stadium in shock.\nWWE WrestleMania Live Blog The reason behind WWE's controversial decision to kick things off with the Universal title match is uncertain but there are various possibilities. Heyman claimed that his client was unhappy with the fact that he is not in the main event and he will go to Las Vegas, hinting at rival wrestling promotion All Elite Wrestling, to look for something better. But that promo seems to be entirely kayfabe so there was probably a different reason behind the strange call. Maybe Lesnar didn't want to be part of the main event fearing the crowd would turn on the match and leave unhappy just like last year.\nSeth Rollins is the new Universal Champion\nThe Conqueror defeated Roman Reigns and was so upset after the bout that he threw the Universal Championship to WWE Chairman and CEO Vince McMahon. But a veteran like the six-time world champion knows exactly how to deal with crowd reaction, doesn't matter if it is positive or negative. The entire focus of this year's WrestleMania is the women's division and the first ever all-women's main event between RAW Women's Champion Ronda Rousey, SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair and Becky Lynch. This may have just been WWE's way of pointing out how radically things have changed in the company and how women are taking over.\nBrock Lesnar wrestled on the first match of the night at WrestleMania"

We know it\u2019s going to have an in-display fingerprint sensor and that the 3.5mm headphone jack has now been ditched. OnePlus hasn\u2019t said anything about the camera but rumors were that it will get a triple-camera system at the back. An official OnePlus 6T teaser has been released by the company today which suggests otherwise.\nOnePlus aired the official teaser for the OnePlus 6T on TV this evening during the India and Pakistan cricket match, a sporting event that brings in a significant audience. The teaser stars actor Amitabh Bachchan who is the company\u2019s brand ambassador in India.\nIt\u2019s evident from the teaser that the OnePlus 6T is going to have a dual camera system at the back. The in-display fingerprint sensor is also referenced so there will not be any surprises on this front come launch day. OnePlus is yet to confirm when it will launch the device, though.\nThe design of the device hasn\u2019t been revealed by the teaser but it\u2019s likely to be similar to that of the OnePlus 6. The company isn\u2019t really expected to make any major changes to the device in the design department.\nFiled in . Read more about OnePlus and OnePlus 6T."

            "The casting news for Dune keeps getting better. The latest addition? Zendaya will be suiting up as Chani, the love interest of Paul, played by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. The actress is reportedly in final negotiations to play the part, per Collider.\nThe sci-fi film, which is an adaptation of Frank Herbert\u2019s novel of the same name, is centered around a clash between Chalamet\u2019s character Paul Atreides\u2019 family and competing noble families, who are fighting over the planet Arrakis. So far, it\u2019s attracted an impressive list of talent.\nOutside of Zendaya and Chalamet, Oscar Isaac and Rebecca Ferguson will be playing Chalamet\u2019s parents. One the other side of the fence, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Baron Harkonnen, and Dave Bautista will be playing their adversaries. And Charlotte Rampling will referee between the two parties as Reverend Mother Mohiam.\nDune follows David Lynch\u2019s 1984 adaptation of the novel. This time, Denis Villeneuve will be handling the script with Eric Roth (Forrest Gump) and Jon Spaihts (Prometheus), as Collider notes.\nZendaya has a full plate at the moment, between Dune and her upcoming HBO show Euphoria, which also boasts an impressive pedigree. In the series, Zendaya stars alongside The Kissing Booth\u2018s Jacob Elordi and Maude Apatow, which follows a group of high school students\u2019 exploits and is being produced by Drake.\nMeanwhile, Chalamet has a handful of films coming up, from A Rainy Day in New York to Little Women and The King. Plus, he is currently filming The French Dispatch, which is Wes Anderson\u2019s next project with Saoirse Ronan and Willem Dafoe. Chalamet is also going to be returning as Elio in the sequel to Call Me By Your Name, which is in the early stages. Director Luca Guadagnino spoke about the idea, which could pick back up in various stages of Elio and Oliver\u2019s lives. \u201cI want to do a sequel because Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Armie Hammer, Michael Stuhlbarg, Amira Casar, Esther Garrel\u2014they are all gems,\u201d he said back in October 2017. \u201cThe texture we built together is very consistent. We created a place in which you believe in the world before them.\u201d Soon, Chalamet and Zendaya will have the chance to do that in a totally different kind of film.\nRelated: Oscar Isaac Could Play Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u2019s Space Dad in Dune"

        "articles": [
            "Kieron Pollard started his IPL season with scores of 21, 5, 7 and 17* in his first four games. Coming off the back of a poor season in 2018 where he averaged just 19.0 in 9 matches, the West Indian appeared dispensable considering the kind of resources Mumbai Indians had in their wings.\nPollard, though, has changed his season around and how!\nIn the last two matches, we have seen Pollard at his very best. From a game-changing 46* against Sunrisers Hyderabad to help win a low-scoring game to an outrageous 83 on Wednesday night against Kings XI Punjab, Pollard has established his place in the Mumbai Indians middle-order.\nAsked to lead the side in Rohit Sharma\u2019s absence, Pollard chose to step up and lead from the front to seal the run-chase himself. He came in at No. 4 with the Mumbai innings ambling along at leisurely pace. At 56/2 in almost 8 overs, Mumbai needed to get going and soon and Pollard made it happen with some sensational hitting.\nKnowing that the asking rate was creeping up, Pollard wasted little time to go on the attack. He hit Ashwin down the ground for a six and soon launched into Sam Curran whom he hit for two towering sixes and a four in the 12th over.\nEven as wickets kept tumbling at the other end, Pollard reached his half-century off 22 balls with his seventh six in the innings. As many as 42 of his 55 runs had come in sixes and the West Indian appeared determined to take Mumbai across the line.\nIn the penultimate over, he went after Curran yet again and hit him for two more sixes and a four in a 17-run over. Though he was dismissed in the final over for 83 in 31 balls, he had done his bit to bring the equation down to a run-a-ball. A six and a four off the first two balls of the final over nearly took Mumbai home and Alzarri Joseph finished it for them.\nPollard\u2019s 83 included 10 sixes and three fours with 72 of his 83 runs coming in boundaries. This is the second maximum number of runs in boundaries in this season after Johnny Bairstow slammed 90 of his 114 runs in boundaries against RCB.\nPollard\u2019s strike rate of 267.74 is the fourth best strike rate in an innings in the season (minimum 40 runs). His overall strike rate in the season has gone up to 194.56 which is the second best for any batsman this year in the IPL after his countryman, Andre Russell, who has 212.39. Pollard has hit 17 sixes this season which is the third best after Russell and Chris Gayle who have 25 and 18 apiece.\nOn his IPL captaincy debut for Mumbai Indians, Pollard put on a terrific batting display to take his side home in an incredible run-chase. He donned responsibility by walking in at No. 4 and ensured he had done the bulk of the work before walking back."

It lays importance on the worship of Goddess Durga or Shakti, which represents the energy of the universe, in her nine different forms. Several states observe the festival and partake in the revelry and even though the stories differ, the core message remains the same \u2013 the victory of good over evil.\nALSO READ: Navratri 2018: Head to these restaurants across India for a delicious Navratri fare\nWhile there are four seasonal Navratris, Sharad Navratri, the one observed post-monsoon, is considered the most auspicious.

This year the festival will be celebrated from October 10 to October 18.\nALSO READ: Importance & Significance of Navratri Festival in India\nIn the eastern and north-eastern states of India, the festival is referred to as Durga Puja.

        "articles": [
            "Drake\u2019s new double album, Scorpion, is out, and one of its recurring themes is fatherhood \u2014 specifically, Drake reportedly fathering the son of a French actress. \u201cThat shit is in stone, sealed and signed,\u201d he raps in the song \u201cMarch 14.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not my lover like Billie Jean, but the kid is mine.\u201d Elsewhere on the album he works out his contentious feelings toward the child\u2019s mother, his overwhelmed reaction to learning he was a dad, and his resentment at the publicity around the event.\nThe news that Drake is owning his parental status is big \u2014 so big it\u2019s overshadowed nearly everything else about the sprawling album, including what is apparently new vocals from the late Michael Jackson. But there\u2019s a lot more to Drake\u2019s rhymes on this subject than his own personal reflections on what it means to be a dad. It might be a stretch to say that the 2018 album Scorpion only spends as much time on fatherhood as it does because Lil Wayne wore Bape once \u2014 but then again, it might not.\nSuch is the delightfully labyrinthine rap feud behind the story of Scorpion \u2014 which starts with \u201cThe Story of Adidon,\u201d the mystifying killer diss track of Drake that Pusha T released in May.\nLike many rap artists, Drake is no stranger to beef. But the latest involving Pusha T and \u201cThe Story of Adidon\u201d has left some fans and onlookers scratching their heads. Why was Drake in blackface? Where did Pusha get that photo? Does Drake really have a secret love child? And what\u2019s all this about invoices and fashion wars, again?\nPusha T dropped \u201cThe Story of Adidon\u201d on YouTube without a lot of fanfare, but it immediately caused a sensation, garnering 2.5 million views in less than a day. And no wonder \u2014 was that Drake in blackface on the cover? (Yes. Yes it was.)\nPusha\u2019s track was a full-on Drake diss, containing lyrics like, \u201cLet\u2019s have a heart-to-heart about your pride / Even though you\u2019re multi, I see that your soul don\u2019t look alive.\u201d The song mocks Drake\u2019s dad, skewers Drake\u2019s attitude toward blackness, and accuses Drake of being a deadbeat dad to Adonis, the son he\u2019s rumored to have fathered with a French woman named Sophie Brussaux, a former porn actress, in October 2017. Drake seems to have publicly acknowledged the relationship at last in multiple tracks from his new album Scorpion, in which he raps that \u201cthe kid is mine,\u201d apparently in response to the uproar.\nIf Pusha going all in on Drake\u2019s approach to fatherhood seems a little harsh, hold up. In fact, the feud between Drake and Pusha may be all about an entirely different set of rappers \u2014 but we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. For now, let\u2019s break down the many things happening in \u201cAdidon,\u201d and what led to Pusha turning in one of the most glorious installments in rap feuds since the halcyon days of 50 Cent.\n\u201cAdidon\u201d tackles complex, intermingled themes of fatherhood and blackness\nPusha T\u2019s thesis for \u201cThe Story of Adidon\u201d is basically twofold: Drake\u2019s confusion about his biracial identity has led him to adopt a hypocritical attitude toward fatherhood. The result, so sayeth Pusha, is that Drake is simultaneously abandoning his son while clinging to his own father for a sense of authentic blackness, even as he enjoys the privileges of wealth and his ability to \u201cpass\u201d as a white man.\nPusha achieves this complex layering by structuring \u201cStory of Adidon\u201d after Jay-Z\u2019s 2017 track \u201cStory of O.J.\u201d Pusha raps over the \u201cStory of O.J.\u201d backing track, and both songs explore the intersection of class, wealth, and black identity in America.\nQuoting O.J.\u2019s famous apocryphal claim \u201cI\u2019m not black, I\u2019m O.J.,\u201d Jay-Z fills his video with cartoon racist stereotypes. The song serves as a wry critique on gentrification and modern attempts to use wealth to overcome one\u2019s perceived blackness.\nThe song also samples Nina Simone\u2019s famous song \u201cFour Women,\u201d which explores the generational impact of slavery and skin-tone prejudice in America. Each woman is without a surname, left to speculate about who her father could have been based on the color of her skin. This basic theme \u2014 of being connected and/or disconnected from black identity through paternity \u2014 plays out directly in \u201cStory of Adidon.\u201d\nThe name \u201cAdidon\u201d refers to Drake\u2019s long-rumored upcoming partnership with Adidas. Pusha T\u2019s track fuels rumors that Drake had intended to name his forthcoming sneaker line \u201cAdidon,\u201d a hybrid of Adidas and Adonis, after Brussaux\u2019s 7-month-old son.\nPusha thinks that\u2019s a bit hypocritical of Drake, for a few reasons. For starters, he says Drake is a \u201cdeadbeat mothafucka, playin\u2019 border patrol\u201d when it comes to his alleged son. \u201cAdonis is your son / and he deserves more than an Adidas press run, that\u2019s real,\u201d he admonishes.\nAt the time of Pusha\u2019s diss, Drake had yet to publicly acknowledge any connection between himself and Adonis. If he had been planning to do it with a line of shoes, it would have been an odd start to fatherhood; but in Scorpion, Drake instead defends his actions in what is apparently a direct response to Pusha.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t hiding my kid from the world,\u201d he protests, \u201cI was hiding the world from my kid\u201d \u2014 specifically from \u201cempty souls\u201d like Pusha who just want to \u201cdebate\u201d him:\nFrom empty souls who just wake up and look to debate Until you staring at your seed, you can never relate\nPusha argues on the track that it would also be in keeping with Drake\u2019s history with his own father. See, Drake\u2019s father, Dennis Graham, abandoned Drake and his mother in Toronto when Drake was 5 years old. Drake spent much of his rap career publicly working out his well-known issues toward his father in song. In recent years, however, the two seem to have fully reconciled. Drake frequently appears in his dad\u2019s celebrity Instagram and put Graham\u2019s picture on the cover of his 2017 song cycle More Life. Graham, for his part, recently got a giant tattoo of his son\u2019s face.\nAll good stuff, right?\nNot to Pusha. In \u201cAdidon,\u201d he claims that Drake is basically using his dad to bolster his own black identity. Drake \u2014 whose mom is Jewish and whose father, Graham, is a black Catholic \u2014 has spoken often about his biracial identity, sometimes as a positive and sometimes as a negative, and sometimes both. In a 2011 interview with the Village Voice, the Canadian appeared baffled by Americans\u2019 perpetual emphasis on skin tone and lightness, noting that American fans frequently viewed him as white, not black.\nPusha\u2019s argument is that Drake doesn\u2019t have any authentic connection to black identity and so has to \u201cparade\u201d his father, described in the song as a Steve Harvey look-alike who embodies a cultural stereotype of cartoonish blackness.\nAnd speaking of caricatures of blackness ...\nWTF is up with that blackface photo?\nPlease stop referring to this picture as \u201cartwork\u201d...I\u2019m not an internet baby, I don\u2019t edit images...this is a REAL picture...these are his truths, see for yourself https://t.co/gd6vRS3HM8 pic.twitter.com/2el58HEZ8F \u2014 King Push (@PUSHA_T) May 30, 2018\nIn the tweet above, Pusha is referring to the startling cover image he included with his video, which is one of a pair of portraits that celebrity photographer David Leyes made of Drake. Drake apparently had the idea to style himself in blackface wearing a Jim Crow T-shirt, according to Leyes in Instagram comments as the diss track was going viral.\nLeyes at first was positive, stating that he\u2019d \u201ccaptured Drake\u2019s idea\u201d and that he was \u201cproud to be part of a strong statement made by a black man about the fucked up culture he is living in.\u201d That pride didn\u2019t last long, however; soon he tweeted at Pusha\u2019s manager asking him to have the photo removed from Pusha\u2019s Twitter. Later, he apparently initiated a Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown of Pusha\u2019s album cover on Instagram. The portraits still remain public on archived versions of Leyes\u2019s website, however, and were captioned \u201cDrake Us & Them.\u201d\nOn Thursday, May 31, Drake responded in a note published in an Instagram story. In the note, he clarified that the photo was 11 years old and produced in the context of him being an actor (he was a regular on Degrassi: The Next Generation at the time) frustrated by the limited and heavily stereotypical roles available to black actors in the industry.\nDrake speaks on \u201cblackface\u201d photos circulating. pic.twitter.com/y3SrOl9DcQ \u2014 Word On Road (@WordOnRd) May 31, 2018\nAt the time of the photo, 2007, Drake was involved in producing a bizarre short film that was also titled Us & Them.\nThe Jim Crow T-shirt Drake wears in the photo is part of a subversive clothing line called Jim Crow Couture, created by the Toronto label Too Black Guys. In response to the uproar, Too Black Guys released a statement to Slate supporting Drake\u2019s use of the imagery.\n\u201cToo Black Guys has a history of representing the black experience in an unapologetic way,\u201d the statement read. \u201cAlthough this was not an image from any of our photoshoots, we feel that Drake, who is a long-time friend of the brand, was brilliantly illustrating the hypocrisy of the Jim Crow era. The subtleties of Drake, a young black man, mimicking how white men used to mimic and dehumanize black people may be lost in a rap battle but we should not be distracted from the issues that are still affecting our communities.\u201d\nPusha, however, seems to be reading Drake\u2019s minstrel performance as unironic internalized racism \u2014 as a straightforward example of a light-skinned man who\u2019s engaging racist caricatures of blackness in order to feel authentic, even as he\u2019s able to enjoy the privileges of appealing to white culture.\nHis statement in response to Drake\u2019s explanation of the photo seems to support this. In an interview Thursday morning on the Los Angeles radio station Real 92.3, Pusha said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it at all. You are silent on all black issues, Drake, with a huge platform.\u201d\nYes, this is all complicated. But that doesn\u2019t even touch the thorny backstory that led us here: a story of ancient beefs, culture clashing, competing production companies, and \u2014 oh, yes \u2014 invoices.\nHere\u2019s what led to \u201cAdidon\u201d\nPusha\u2019s \u201cAdidon\u201d is a response to Drake\u2019s recent, relatively sweet-tempered diss \u201cDuppy Freestyle,\u201d which is itself a response to the recent Pusha track \u201cInfrared,\u201d which is a response to the 2017 Drake track \u201cTwo Birds, One Stone,\u201d which is a response to 2016\u2019s \u201cHGTV\u201d from Pusha, which is a response to Drake\u2019s 2013 \u201cTuscan Leather,\u201d which is a response to Pusha\u2019s 2012 track \u201cExodus 23:1,\u201d which extends a feud that dates back to the mid-aughts.\nGot all that?\nOkay, let\u2019s back up a few years. Pusha T and his brother Malice (later known as No Malice) formed the rap duo Clipse in 1992 when they were still teens living in Virginia Beach. Though they were breakout successes, they ran into trouble in the mid-2000s due to issues with their record label, Jive. Eventually the two each went solo, and Pusha signed with GOOD Music, a notable record label founded by Kanye West in 2004 and boasting a litany of famed artists from Common to Big Sean to Kid Cudi.\nAt odds with the GOOD crew is the crew collectively known as YMCMB \u2014 that is, all the rappers and artists signed to, or affiliated with, Lil Wayne\u2019s label Young Money Entertainment and the label Cash Money Records, co-founded by Birdman (a.k.a. Baby) and his brother Slim Williams.\nAs early as 2006, Pusha took issue with members of the YMCMB crew. Initially, as chronicled in the 2006 Clipse track \u201cMr. Me Too,\u201d he directed his irritation solely at Lil Wayne. But this ire also swirled amid a culture of nearly constant back-and-forth taunting between various members of YMCMB and GOOD, most notably between Lil Wayne/Drake and Kanye/Jay-Z (who isn\u2019t on GOOD but is loosely affiliated through his work with Kanye).\nPart of this animosity seems to have stemmed from general ribbing and one-upmanship \u2014 it\u2019s worth noting that most of these artists have collaborated repeatedly over the years \u2014 and occasionally from disagreements over style similarities and perceived theft of lyrics and musical elements.\nPusha did his part to pitch in, taking an apparent swipe at Lil Wayne and his father-son relationship with Birdman in his verse on 2008\u2019s \u201cRe-Up Intro.\u201d Then he came out hard against Drake, starting with his 2011 freestyle \u201cDon\u2019t Fuck With Me,\u201d which he rapped over Drake\u2019s \u201cDreams Money Can Buy.\u201d\nPusha\u2019s attitude toward Drake in this early offering is one that stays consistent throughout his work: namely, Drake is a lyrics stealer, a shameless opportunist, and kind of a pussy.\nMoreover, he crucially opens this song with what would prove to be a proverb: \u201cRe-up gang, G.O.O.D. Music, Def Jam / I love my family.\u201d Pusha clearly sees the YMCMB crew as disloyal, a theme he\u2019d go in hard on in the 2012 track \u201cExodus 23:1.\u201d In this track, he launches a full-scale onslaught at the YMCMB crew, whom he describes as prone to cribbing other rappers\u2019 musical styles and production elements. He portrays Drake as being a weak character surrounded by disloyal sycophants, and Drake and Lil Wayne as fake thugs reliant on Birdman\u2019s talent and influence.\nIn response to this track, Lil Wayne famously responded, \u201cFuck \u2019em\u201d:\nFuk pusha t and anybody that love em \u2014 Lil Wayne WEEZY F (@LilTunechi) May 24, 2012\nIn the years since, the beef between Pusha and Drake has generally gone like this: Pusha claims Drake steals his best stuff from other artists while he searches for authentic identity; Drake implies Pusha exaggerates the seriousness and extent of his life experience as a drug dealer in order to seem more street than he actually is.\nIt did, however, get an especially fun twist with \u201cDuppy Freestyle.\u201d In the song, Drake jokes that Pusha owes him money for the extra attention his diss track will bring Pusha\u2019s new album, noting, \u201cTell Ye, \u2018We got a invoice comin\u2019 to you\u2019 / considerin\u2019 that we just sold another 20 for you.\u201d\nPusha clapped back on Twitter, \u201cSend the invoice for the extra 20 ...\u201d and that\u2019s exactly what Drizzy did, via Instagram, the same day \u201cDuppy\u201d dropped. The invoice requests $100,000 for \u201cpromotional assistance and career reviving.\u201d\nYou\u2019re welcome. A post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on May 25, 2018 at 6:08pm PDT\nAnd of course, Pusha T\u2019s response with \u201cStory of Adidon\u201d has vaulted the feud into the stuff of legend \u2014 which itself helped lead to Scorpion.\nHow did we come this far? Is all this really just about record label rivalry?\nKinda yes, and kinda no.\nHere\u2019s what really led up to \u201cAdidon.\u201d (Hint: it\u2019s about money, contracts, and who wore Bape first.)\nSo why did Pusha T hate Lil Wayne and fam so much? Apparently, two reasons.\nAround the time of 2006\u2019s \u201cMr. Me Too,\u201d he was annoyed at Lil Wayne for stealing the street fashion style, including specific labels like Bape, expressed by Clipse and their pal Pharrell. You may not think that sounds significant, but you\u2019d be wrong. Lil Wayne famously wore Bape in his 2006 video \u201cHustler Musik,\u201d and posed in Bape for the cover of Vibe:\nI really cant believe this @Drake vs @PUSHA_T beef started with Lil Wayne and Pusha battling over who wore Bape first.\nThis Hip Hop beef is rather stupid. pic.twitter.com/myAxLtqNTy \u2014 Renzel (@FoluShaw) May 26, 2018\nWhile this feud was happening, Lil Wayne went off in an interview with Complex about the perception that he was somehow stealing Clipse and Pharrell\u2019s street style. \u201cI don\u2019t see no fuckin\u2019 Clipse,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on man. ... This is a fucking legend you\u2019re talking to right here. ... Who the fuck is Pharrell?\u201d\n(Well, it was 2006.)\nIn response, Pusha bit back hard in a 2007 interview, including roping in homophobic rumors about Lil Wayne\u2019s relationship with Birdman (the pair famously kissed a couple of times) to imply that Lil Wayne wasn\u2019t a real legend:\n\u201cYou can\u2019t kiss other men, you can\u2019t wobble dee-wobble dee, and and you can\u2019t bite styles,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t bite everybody\u2019s styles. You can\u2019t try to rap like Jay-Z, dress like the Clipse, become a coke dealer after 5 albums, and now dress like Jim Jones. You can\u2019t do all that and be a legend. You have to be a trendsetter and he ain\u2019t setting any trends.\u201d\nSo part of this is about clothes, and part of it seems to be about the kind of hustle you have to bring to be a real (straight) rapper, and who\u2019s bringing it better.\nBut the other reason, according to Hot 97\u2019s Ebro, arose in 2001, as a result of the Pharrell-produced collaboration between Birdman and Clipse, \u201cWhat Happened to That Boy?\u201d\nThough I could find no sourcing for this beyond the wisdom of Ebro, the word is that Birdman didn\u2019t pay Pharrell for his work on this track, which is why Pharrell has rarely, if ever, worked with Birdman\u2019s family of artists since. Pusha\u2019s longstanding animosity for all Cash Money artists, then, is a show of loyalty to Pharrell.\nAs of April, Drake seemed to be teasing an upcoming Pharrell collab \u2014 but it never materialized. If in fact this decades-old nonpayment is the source of all Pusha\u2019s animosity, his timing may have had something to do with his pal\u2019s absence from the album.\nAll that really matters in the end is that this is truly excellent beef\nOf course, most of this decades-old context isn\u2019t making it into the mainstream; most onlookers are just enjoying an old-school, epic rap battle of the sort not seen since the \u201990s \u2014 like Tupac\u2019s legendary \u201cHit \u2019Em Up,\u201d his hilarious diss of Biggie Smalls \u2014 or the various shots that Jay-Z, Nas, and 50 Cent traded across the early aughts. These were diss tracks that could escalate the conversation and the genre along with the argument. Similarly, \u201cThe Story of Adidon\u201d isn\u2019t just a diss; it\u2019s great rap, and it\u2019s hard not to sit back and soak up the creative energy being produced by all this drama.\nDrake came with rap punchlines and Pusha hit back with investigative journalism \u2014 Astead (@AsteadWesley) May 30, 2018\nDrake gonna have to send Pusha another invoice for his funeral \u2620\ufe0f \u2014 Tamara Dhia (@tamaradhia) May 30, 2018\nTo say this has excited the populace is putting it mildly. Fans are gearing up for some kind of Super-Saiyan-y leveling up of the conflict:\nDrake gotta fight pusha T pic.twitter.com/4tj9QrLC6J \u2014 Kev\u00edn (@KevOnStage) May 30, 2018\nThe irony of all this? Years ago, Drake was a huge, adorably geeky Pusha T fan.\nimagine buying a pusha t signed mic off eBay for $200 when you're 17 and then dropping \"duppy freestyle\" 14 years later. we are in the darkest timeline lmfao. pic.twitter.com/4AJhAFrj5u \u2014 rap is stupid (@ottergawd) May 27, 2018\nWe\u2019re guessing if Drake is still using that autographed Pusha T microphone, he\u2019s only using it to sing sad songs. Meanwhile, Pusha made it clear in an interview with the Breakfast Club that \u201call bets are off,\u201d and this is only the beginning."

            "In what may be considered one of the promotion\u2019s biggest events ever, Bellator 206 \u2014 which takes place from the SAP Center in San Jose, California \u2014 features a champion vs. champion title fight, the latest in a classic MMA rivalry and the start of another Bellator Grand Prix.\nIn the main event, Gegard Mousasi will make his first defense of the Bellator Middleweight Title, facing current Bellator Welterweight Champion Rory MacDonald. Mousasi comes into the contest riding a seven-fight win streak that goes back to 2016. Since coming over to Bellator last year after his UFC contract expired, Mousasi scored a controversial decision win over Alexander Shlemenko at Bellator 185 in October 2017 before scoring a first-round TKO of Rafael Carvalho back in May at UFC 200 to win the promotion\u2019s middleweight title. MacDonald also came over to Bellator after his UFC deal expired, making his promotional debut with a second-round submission of Paul Daley at Bellator 179 in May 2017. He then defeated Douglas Lima by decision at Bellator 192 back in January to become welterweight champion.\nWith a win, MacDonald would become the first fighter in Bellator history to hold titles in two weight classes simultaneously. He would also become the second Bellator fighter to win titles in two weight classes (Joe Warren is the first, with title wins at featherweight and bantamweight).\nThe co-main event will see the fourth installment of the legendary rivalry between Quinton \u201cRampage\u201d Jackson and Wanderlei Silva. Silva won the first two bouts \u2014 via first-round TKO in the final of the PRIDE Middleweight Grand Prix at PRIDE Final Conflict in November 2003 and via second-round KO to retain the PRIDE Middleweight Title at PRIDE 28. When the two met under the UFC banner at UFC 92 in December 2008, Jackson was the one scoring the first-round knockout.\nJackson enters this bout on back-to-back losses, losing to Muhammed \u201cKing Mo\u201d Lawal at Bellator 175 in March 2017 before falling to Chael Sonnen in the first Bellator Heavyweight Grand Prix match back in January at Bellator 192. Meanwhile, this will be Silva\u2019s first fight since losing to Sonnen in the main event of the June 2017 Bellator NYC pay-per-view. That was Silva\u2019s first fight since serving a three-year suspension from the Nevada State Athletic Commission.\nBellator 206 will also feature the start of the Welterweight Grand Prix, with the winner ultimately claiming the Bellator Welterweight Title and a cash prize of $1 million from rapper 50 Cent. The tournament\u2019s opening bout will see former champions Douglas Lima and Andrey Koreshkov.\nBellator 206 Results:\nBellator Middleweight Championship: (c.) Gegard Mousasi def. (Welterweight Champion) Rory MacDonald via TKO (Rd. 2, 3:23)\nHeavyweight: Quinton Jackson def. Wanderlei Silva via TKO (Rd. 2, 4:32)\nBellator Welterweight Grand Prix Opening Round Bout: Douglas Lima def. Andrey Koreshkov via technical submission (rear-naked choke) (Rd. 5, 3:04)\nFeatherweight: Aaron Pico def. Leandro Higo via KO (Rd. 1, 3:19)\nWomen\u2019s Strawweight: Keri Melendez def. Dakota Zimmerman via split decision (29-28, 28-29, 29-28)\nFeatherweight: Gaston Bolanos def. Ysidro Gutierrez via KO (Rd. 2, 1:37)"

The series is released at a fixed time in the United States based on Netflix\u2019s head office time which is located in California. As always, once the clock strikes midnight in California, it\u2019ll land on Netflix.\nHere\u2019s a region based table on when Ozark season 2 will be available on Netflix.\nTime Available Timezone Location 00:00 PDT West Coast \u2013 US 01:00 MT Mid-West \u2013 US 02:00 CET Central \u2013 US 03:00 EDT East Coast \u2013 US 09:00/08:00 BST/GMT United Kingdom 17:00 AEST Australia 09:00 CEST Europe 15:00 SGT Singapore\nNote: Release times are subject to change\nCan\u2019t find Ozark season 2 on Netflix?\nYou may need to disconnect and reconnect to Netflix to find the new season.

            "The Flash Season 5 Episode 16 Recap\nLast week on The Flash, Gorilla Grodd caught the team off guard after successfully testing the Meta cure on King Shark. After Barry and Nora were taken down in the field, King shark chose to emerge once again to defeat Grodd seemingly once and for all. Elsewhere, Joe helped Iris move past her fear of Cicada after their confrontation a few weeks back.\nWith the Meta-human cure now ready for use, this episode of The Flash sees the team try to figure out how to subdue Cicada to take it. Meanwhile, Joe eases back into work with a new lead on the Meta killing villain, while Nora tries really, really hard to make sure things go to plan.\nAcid Master Strikes\nThe Episode Starts off with Nora visiting the Reverse-Flash in 2049. Thawne is upset that the timeline is changing before their eyes. Quickly loosing their window of opportunity to kill Cicada, they realize that some sort of variable is changing the timeline. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs, Nora cracks the whip on locating Cicada, but can\u2019t find any leads. Later at Jitters, Barry, Iris, and Nora try a new brew called the XS-presso, when a Meta named Acid Master emerges at the college lab. The Flash and XS arrive on the scene, but the acid Spewing Meta is able to escape. Nora realizes that the burn form his acid is similar to one in the photo from The Flash\u2019s final confrontation with Cicada.\nAt STAR Labs, Nora explains the connection to the Meta and the Newspaper photo from the future. Team Flash tries to figure out a way for Barry to talk to Cicada, and Nora urges Barry to try and find the good in Dwyer like he has in so many others. Nora and Iris talk about the plan, causing the former to get an idea of how to find Cicada. Team Flash eventually catch Acid Master, disguising Killer Frost as the Meta. Like clockwork, Cicada attacks but she\u2019s able to freeze his dagger to the wall. The Flash tries to talk to Cicada into the cure, arguing to do it for his legacy. Dwyer is able to incapacitate Barry, but Killer Frost intervenes. Killer Frost Saves Barry at the last second, but Cicada gets away with the dagger.\nFollowing A Hunch\nWith Joe back at work, he tries to catch up on the massive stack of Cicada Task Force files. Cecile offers to help, and they deduce that Dr. Vanessa Ambers might have a lead on Orlin Dwyer\u2019s niece Grace. At the hospital, Joe and Cecile question Dr. Ambres and her Meta abilities signal that she may have something to do with drugs that have gone missing. Joe is a bit uneasy with Cecile using her powers during the investigation, causing him to dismiss Ambres. Later, Joe visits Barry at his loft as he broods about his failure to get Cicada to take the cure. Joe gives a pep talk that inspires him to appeal to Cicada\u2019s human side.\nJoe eventually apologizes to Cecile about the argument earlier, offering for her to join his interrogation of Dr. Ambers. They eventually reveal the existence of the Meta cure, and she agrees to set up a meet with Dwyer. More importantly, Ambers reveals that that the wound in Grace\u2019s head caused by the satellite shard is now glowing. Joe tells to Barry about the lead, and that Dyer\u2019s niece is indeed a Meta.\nFamily Matters\nMeanwhile, Team Flash try to figure out where things went wrong with the last Cicada encounter, but Nora won\u2019t give up hope on her father yet. Nora listens to old recordings of her father\u2019s appeals, when Iris offers to go to the rooftop of jitters. Iris reveals that she wants to spend as much time with her as possible before they defeat Cicada.\nTeam Flash weighs several approaches, but eventually settle on trying to use Barry\u2019s human personality to appeal to Cicada. Nora has a heart to heart with Iris, while Barry listens on. Nora feels remorseful about not spending enough time with her parents, and Barry reveals that he\u2019s going to confront Cicada as a father. Barry\u2019s plan eventually works, convincing Dwyer to take the cure.\nCicada 2.0\nBarry brings Cicada to S.T.A.R. Labs, but the latter requests Dr. Ambres to stitch him up after the cure is administered as a condition for taking it. During the Operation, Cecille gets weird vibes from Cicada before he\u2019s put under. Ambres administers the cure and Barry gets his powers back, meaning that it worked. Sheloque and Nora celebrate their victory, but questions how she knew Acid Master would lead them to Cicada. Suddenly, the power goes out, and a female Cicada look-alike bursts through the window. Even though she\u2019s seemingly not able to dampen Team Flash\u2019s powers, Cicada 2.0 is able to shoot energy blasts and wields two daggers.\nKiller frost uses her powers to heal Dwyer up to move him, and Team Flash confronts the look-alike. She manages to take them out one by one, eventually wrecking the cortex. On the way out, she murders Dr. Ambres, taking Dwyer with her. Team flash soon realizes that this new threat might be something worse than Cicada himself. Later, Cicada 2.0 is revealed to be an adult version of Grace Dwyer. Glowing forehead and all, this reveal is the same person who young Grace was talking to a few episodes ago in her dream.\nWhat are your thoughts about The Flash season 5 episode 16?

A VAR review was needed to determine whether the ball hit off Llorente's arm first, but the goal was upheld and Spurs retook the advantage via the away goal tiebreaker.\nThe reversal of Sterling's goal sent the Spurs to their first European semifinal since 1962."

There is no need to have four on the team and one of the four will be gone.\nThat one, in this prediction, is Joshua Dobbs. Dobbs has done a great job in the preseason but likely is not enough to keep him a Steeler.\nThe Steelers could look to trade Dobbs or just outright cut him.

            "Because apparently, it needs to be said: Don't put your fingers anywhere near a nurse shark's teeth.\nA woman who tried to hand-feed a shark is lucky she still has a hand. Yes, it bit her. IT'S A SHARK.\nMelissa Brunning of Perth, Australia, was on a holiday yacht cruise in Dugong Bay on Australia's coast, when four tawny nurse sharks (Nebrius ferrugineus) swam close to the back of the boat, Perth Now reported. Several of Brunning's companions dropped fish in the water near the sharks, one of which measured almost 7 feet (2 meters) in length.\nHowever, when it was Brunning's turn, she tried to feed the shark directly by hand. As the shark snatched the food, its jaws closed on her finger, and it yanked her into the water \u2014 a terrifying moment that one of her friends captured on video, according to Perth Now. [Images: Sharks & Whales from Above]\nIn the footage, which was shared on Twitter by Australia's 7 News Melbourne on July 1, Brunning is seen bending toward the water, food in hand, as a nurse shark swims by. As it comes nearer, she puts her hand down into the water next to its head \u2014 and then screams as the shark bites down on her finger and pulls her in.\n\"It happened so quickly,\" Brunning told 7 News Melbourne, and the pain was so excruciating that she initially thought her finger had been bitten off completely.\n\"It felt like it was shredding off the bone,\" she said. \"I couldn't even look at the finger because I thought it was gone.\"\nSee more\nBut after the shark released Brunning's finger, she found that it was still very much attached to her hand, though severely lacerated. Because the location where she was on holiday was so remote, she didn't seek treatment until nearly two weeks later, by which time her finger was badly infected, and X-rays revealed that she had suffered a torn ligament and a bone fracture, according to 7 News Melbourne.\nTawny nurse sharks, also known as spitting sharks and sleepy sharks, are found in coastal waters spanning from east to west along Australia's northern coast. They are \"relatively stout\" sharks with blunt snouts holding rows of sharp teeth, and they can grow to be as long as 10.5 feet (3.2 m), representatives of the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries wrote in a species description.\nThe accident was unquestionably harrowing, but labeling it a \"shark attack,\" as 7 News Melbourne did, is misleading, as Brunning literally put a handful of food \u2014 and her hand \u2014 into the shark's mouth voluntarily; the animal simply reacted as it normally would in the presence of food, ecologist and shark researcher David Shiffman, a research fellow at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada, wrote in a tweet on July 2.\nSee more\nAt least Brunning acknowledged her responsibility for the incident, adamantly affirming that it was entirely her fault, that the shark was blameless and that she was very, very lucky that her injury wasn't \"a lot worse,\" she told Perth Now.\nBrunning said her future interactions with marine wildlife will be better informed thanks to her harrowing experience, as she intends to \"respect marine life, and look at it in awe, but just leave them alone,\" Perth Now reported.\nOriginal article on Live Science."

            "If you\u2019re plugged in online you may have heard of a certain Avengers: Endgame theory involving Ant-Man. Specifically, Ant-Man plunging into Thanos\u2019 butthole and expanding his size in order to defeat the villain ... from the inside.\nThat\u2019s basically the extent of the \u201cThanus\u201d theory, which is a less a theory than the internet\u2019s new favorite Avengers meme. Even though it probably ... OK, most likely ... OK, most definitely won\u2019t happen in the actual film, a live-action version of what only existed in Photoshops and one-liners has now emerged on the internet for all of our viewing pleasure.\nThough the Ant-Man-jumps-up-Thanos\u2019-butt ending has reached new levels of buzz over the past few weeks, the theory first popped up before Infinity War even came out. According to KnowYourMeme, the joke started on Reddit, as loads of off-beat, shitpost tier theories oft do.\nOn a post suggesting various ways to defeat Thanos, users speculated about Ant-Man shrinking down in size, crawling up Thanos\u2019 various orifices (Thorfices) and expanding (from mouth to urethra specifically, or just entering inside of Thanos someplace else) until the purple villain exploded. It was a post about Ant-Man crawling into Thanos\u2019 ear that the realization that Ant-Man would have to crawl into a more intimate part of Thanos\u2019 anatomy sprung forth.\nReddit user Rayhann specified \u201cthe one where you crawl up his ass and deeply violate his being.\u201d\nFor the record, Squirrel Girl didn\u2019t explicitly crawl up Thanos\u2019 ass, but the panel showcasing her victory has Thanos in a particularly compromising position.\nThe concept of Ant-Man crawling up Thanos\u2019 ass was out there, floating around far corners of the internet. But the theory made it to Twitter \u2014 the equivalent of emerging into the mainstream \u2014 just a few days after Infinity War.\nScott Lang\u2019s jarring absence from the movie prompted Twitter user @filmgloss to theorize just why Ant-Man didn\u2019t make it into the movie.\nmarvel saw the post about how ant man could defeat thanos by crawling into his ass and instantly growing in size and that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t put him in the movie, send tweet \u2014 c a t (@filmgloss) April 30, 2018\nWhile this tweet did quite well, the screenshot of it on Tumblr did even better. Soon, other fandoms took notice and the meme proliferated throughout the internet. The theory culminated last summer when a reporter point-blank asked Paul Rudd about it.\nBut renewed hype in the weeks before Avengers: Endgame have stirred up this theory turned meme. Subreddit r/dankmemes began to share memes about Ant-Man crawling up Thanos\u2019s butt, some with fake screenshots of the Russo Brothers weighing in. Like Powerful Shaggy before it, the meme exploded when it went off Reddit and Tumblr and to Twitter, bringing awareness and merit to this quite shitpost-y shitpost. A Brazilian petition dedicated to making this moment happen in Avengers: Endgame has amassed over 35,000 signatures at the time of writing.\nWith all the footage done, however, it isn\u2019t super likely that the Russo brothers incorporate this outlandish theory, even in a post-credits scene.\nCorrection (April 1): A previous version of this story credited the wrong creator of the video. YouTube user HELLO THERE created the Thanos video. We\u2019ve edited the article to reflect this.\nThat\u2019s alright, though, as heroic internet denizen HELLO THERE created an incredibly accurate rendering of Ant-Man diving right into Thanos\u2019 butt and expanding. We can rest easy knowing that some version of the scene exists in the world. Now we wait and see if Marvel incorporates it into the existing film.\nWe\u2019ll find out just how much Ant-Man matters in the final plan when Avengers: Endgame comes out on April 26.\nUpdate: Feeling gut pressure from the Marvel community, Josh Brolin, the actor behind Thanos, has weighed in a few times on the Thanus theory.\nOn March 28 he posted an Instagram video of himself sitting on a toilet and trying to \u201cflush Ant-Man.\u201d\nMost recently, Brolin shared an explicit photo of Thanos on his Instagram. It\u2019s a full nude from the back, with Thanos\u2019 purple derri\u00e8re on full display. Though it could easily be a tribute to how thicc Thanos\u2019 ass is, Brolin made it clear that the Mad Titan\u2019s voluptuous behind has something to do with Ant-Man.\n\u201cPowerlifting Ant-Man squish,\u201d read the hashtags."

            "Go Big Read: Rainout is still the buzz for the Nebraska football team and other kernels\nGo Big Read: Rainout is still the buzz for the Nebraska football team and other kernels by Oliver VanDervoort\nThe Nebraska football team has released its version of why the game Saturday was canceled but now Akron has given its official statement.\nEarlier Sunday, the Nebraska football team and the athletic program released a statement attempting to explain why Saturday\u2019s game couldn\u2019t be played. Unsurprisingly, the statement claimed the Huskers were ready and willing to make it work and the Zips were the ones who backed out.\nOn Sunday evening, Akron released its own version of events and \u2026 basically confirmed what Nebraska had been saying. Athletic director Larry Williams released a statement that included talk about the inability to secure accommodation in and around Lincoln.\nWilliams added that the only accommodations they would have been able to get would have split the team up. Apparently having the team in multiple locations would have not been \u201cin the best interests of our team.\u201d\nAkron AD Larry Williams releases a statement explaining why Akron chose not to stick around. As it relates to accommodations it\u2019s worth noting that NU was exploring using on campus dorms to House the team. pic.twitter.com/XyrnfKanNC \u2014 Sam McKewon (@swmckewonOWH) September 3, 2018\nThis comes on the heels of reports that Nebraska was so keen on getting the game in that they were looking at possibly finding dorm rooms or other on-campus housing in order to get Akron to play the game on Sunday.\nWilliams also said that the Zips and Huskers are still talking about finding a way to play the game. That would mean a week 14 matchup.\nWilliams made it clear that so far the talks have only been if the teams need another game in order to become bowl eligible. It\u2019s not clear if Akron would agree to travel all the way to Lincoln if they had week 14 free but didn\u2019t need it to try and get to a bowl.\nIf other reports are accurate, it would appear the Zips have the Huskers between a rock and a hard place. Those reports state the contract between Nebraska and Akron made the money the Cornhuskers offered to play the game, guaranteed once it kicked off.\nIf that\u2019s the case, then it\u2019s a monumental good to have allowed the game to start, considering the weather that was already in the area. The game was delayed and eventually canceled immediately after the opening kick.\nAkron could now ask for an additional payout in order to make a return trek to Lincoln. One has to wonder if they would almost be able to hold the Nebraska football season hostage."

            "More than a quarter of Minnesota\u2019s registered voters cast ballots in Tuesday\u2019s state primary elections, with DFL voters nearly doubling the turnout of Republicans.\nAbout 902,000 of the state\u2019s registered 3.2 million voters had cast primary ballots as of Wednesday morning with all but one precinct reporting. More than 582,000 of those primary voters filled out DFL ballots.\nThe total number of voters was the highest in a state primary election since 1982, and the second highest going back to 1950.

Stone and other staff expected 250 voters throughout the day, but had recorded nearly 400 just after 5 p.m.\nRelated Articles Watch: Tim Walz, Scott Jensen to debate on MPR at noon\nFormer MN Gov.

First day, last day, Boxing Day.\nBut there are plenty of sub-plots hidden away in the 38-game schedule.\nHere are the things you might have missed.\nThe impossible opening task\nAfter managing a total of 75 points last season, Liverpool's focus is to improve on that in order to get closer to Manchester City at the top of the table. A simple way of doing that is improving on the results of a previous year.\nBut with a kind enough start \u2013 West Ham, Crystal Palace, Brighton, Leicester \u2013 Liverpool cannot do better than their efforts of 2017/18, as they took maximum points.\nNot until September 15, where the club will become the first visitors to Tottenham's new stadium, can the Reds look to improve on what happened in the previous campaign.\nIt means even a perfect start will just about be par for Jurgen Klopp's side.\nFestive fears\nKlopp has often been a vociferous critic of the festive fixture pile-up, something which will soon be a thing of the past after the Premier League announced a winter break beginning the 2019/20 season.\nTwo seasons ago, he had to deal with just 48 hours between a high-intensity game with Manchester City and a tricky trip to relegation threatened Sunderland. Last year, a similar scenario, with Leicester at home soon followed by Burnley at Turf Moor.\nBut though there is more space between the festive fixtures of 2018/19 \u2013 four days \u2013 they involve a home game with Arsenal, and then a New Year's trip to champions Manchester City.\n(Image: Photo by John Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images)\nThe wait to make amends\nIt is hard to believe, but Liverpool have not beaten Chelsea at Anfield since 2012, when the Reds triumphed 4-1 days after their FA Cup final defeat.\nSimilarly galling, perhaps, is the fact it will be over four years since Liverpool have beaten Manchester United in the Premier League.\nBoth those waits will continue until December, at least.\nLiverpool won't face United until December 15, at Anfield, with the return game on February 23.\nThe home clash with Chelsea is on April 13 \u2013 six years and 11 months since their last home win over the London side.\n(Image: ANTHONY DEVLIN/AFP/Getty Images)\nEnding on a high \u2013 but all isn't as it seems\nFor the third successive season, Liverpool end their league campaign with a home game against a newly-promoted side.\nAfter Middlesbrough and Brighton, Wolverhampton Wanderers will be the visitors.\nAfter 3-0 and 4-0 wins to confirm their Champions League qualification, what price a 5-0?\nPretty high, in fact.\nThough more will be known on May 12, after 37 games, the sense is Wolves will be looking at the higher reaches of the league, rather than lower down.\nHaving already made some big moves in the transfer window, and supported by the work of super agent Jorge Mendes, the Championship title-winners should provide a sterner test than it seems on paper."

            "LANSING \u2013 Some medical marijuana dispensaries will get to stay open until Dec. 15, under new emergency rules adopted by the state Tuesday, while others will have to close.\nAccording to the new rules, about 108 medical marijuana dispensaries that have been operating while they\u2019re waiting for the Medical Marijuana Licensing Board to consider their application for a license will get to stay open until December. These are the dispensaries where owners got their initial applications in by Feb. 15, got approval from the communities where they are operating and submitted the second step of the application process by June 15.\nAnother 98 dispensaries that submitted initial applications by Feb. 15, but didn\u2019t submit the second step of the application in a timely manner or at all, will get cease and desist orders next week and must shut down. If they continue operating, the owners risk not being able to get a license at all.\nA list of the 98 dispensaries will be released by the state later this month. In March, the state sent cease and desist letters to more than 200 dispensaries that were operating, but didn't submit applications for licenses, ordering them to shut down.\nMore:Board sets final language for proposal to legalize recreational pot\nMore:Why these marijuana edibles are prohibited by Michigan regulators\nAnd yet another emergency rule will require marijuana business owners who have been approved for a license to pay the $48,000 regulatory assessment within 10 days or be forced to shut down until they come up with the money. Currently, 37 marijuana business owners have been approved for licenses, but only 10 have paid their regulatory assessments and are up and running. Of those, 16 were approved last month and 21 were approved on Monday.\nThe move is meant to separate out the dispensaries who are serious about getting a license and those who just want to operate with little state oversight.\nThe rules come as the state is trying to transition from the medical marijuana market devised after voters legalized weed for medical use in 2008 to an industry that is regulated and taxed by the state. The old market was made up of caregivers who could grow up to 12 plants for each of five patients as well as themselves. There was little, if any, state oversight of the caregiver-model of medical marijuana.\nThe new regulated market is much more expensive for business owners and creates five classes of licenses for growers, processors, testing facilities, transporters and dispensaries. Once licensed, the owners have to come up with the regulatory assessment, pay city fees, get their products tested under a more stringent set of state guidelines, and pay a 3 percent tax on the gross receipts of the dispensary as well as the 6 percent sales tax.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to move the process along,\u201d said Andrew Brisbo, executive director of the Bureau of Medical Marijuana Regulation.\nThe new Dec. 15 deadline is the third time the department has extended the deadline for dispensaries to get a license or shut down. While Brisbo was adamant last month that a Sept. 15 deadline wasn\u2019t going to be pushed again, the department relented after hearing from a group of lawmakers, officials in Ann Arbor and Lansing, and several organizations that were worried about losing access to medical marijuana if many of the dispensaries around the state had to close.\n\u201cThis extension focuses on ensuring access,\u201d Brisbo said.\nThe state has received 702 license applications since Dec. 15, including 401 applicants who have submitted full applications, and the review and licensing process has been slow and tedious. Preliminary approval has been given to 72 applicants, while 53 have been denied. And 37 full licenses have been awarded while eight have been denied. The state\u2019s regulatory assessment, which covers the cost to administer and enforce the medical marijuana market, will increase from $48,000 to $66,000 on Oct. 1. Those costs are spread over the state departments of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs, Attorney General, Michigan State Police, Treasury and Health and Human Services.\nMichigan voters approved legalizing medical marijuana in 2008 and will consider legalizing weed for recreational use on Nov. 6. If it gets approved by voters, the licensing of recreational marijuana businesses will be the responsibility of LARA, not the politically-appointed board that hands out licenses for medical marijuana businesses.\nKathleen Gray covers the marijuana industry for the Detroit Free Press.

            "OK, originally this was going to be about the Atlanta Dream and how they would move on from the season-ending injury to Angel McCoughtry, their lone All-Star and best player. But honestly, the Dream have looked fine so far, winning all three games without her, and are likely to still get a top-two seed and a bye into the semifinals.\nInstead, let's talk about the Dallas Wings, because wow, what a mess. In the short WNBA season things can change wicked fast, and this Wings team is a prime example. Just a month ago they were flying high, having won seven of eight games to move to 14-9 on the season. Liz Cambage had set a new WNBA scoring record with 53 points, and with no clear-cut favorite they looked capable of making a deep playoff run.\nThey haven't won since.\nEight straight losses have sent them tumbling down the standings, where they're hanging onto the eighth and final playoff spot by just a thread. Oh, and they just fired their coach, Fred Williams, after he and team exec Gregg Bibb reportedly got into an altercation outside of the visitors lockerroom in D.C. on Sunday. Following the Wings' 93-80 loss to the Mystics, their eighth consecutive defeat, \"Williams and Bibb had to be restrained by other Wings staffers, and Williams was screaming obscenities,\" HighPostHoops.com reported.\nWith three games to play for each team, the Wings still hold a one-game lead over the Aces and own the tiebreaker between the two teams, so they do have the upper hand. Still, this is by no means over considering the two teams play each other once more, and the Wings also have road games with the Sun and Storm left.\nTaj McWilliams-Franklin is going to have her work cut out for her to turn this thing around quickly. Because assuming they still make the playoffs, it's going to be a quick turnaround with a single-elimination game staring them in the face.\nOn another note, it would be a mistake not to acknowledge the announcement that Lindsay Whalen is set to retire at the end of this season. Most assumed it was coming once she decided to become coach at the University of Minnesota, but now it is official. This is the last run for one of the greatest point guards the league has ever seen. There will be time in the future to look back on her remarkable career with the Connecticut Sun and Minnesota Lynx, the latter of whom she's led to four championships, but for now, let's just enjoy however many games a true legend has left.\n1. Seattle Storm (24-8) -- No movement\nIt was a busy week for the Storm, but another successful one, as they went 3-1 to move to 24-8 on the season. Already owning the second-best record in franchise history, Seattle's magic number for clinching the No. 1 seed is just one. That means just one Storm win or one Dream loss gets the Storm a bye to the semi-finals and homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs.\n2. Atlanta Dream (22-10) -- No movement\nAngel McCoughtry is unfortunately out for the season, but you wouldn't know it by looking at the Dream's last three outings. They've now won six in a row, including the last three without their All-Star and leading second-leading scorer. Which shows they're still going to be a problem heading into the playoffs -- especially with their stout defense.\n3. Washington Mystics (20-11) -- Up 1\nWell, well, well, look at the Mystics. After hitting a rough patch in the middle of July, Washington has bounced back with six straight wins to jump up into third place. Yes, one of those wins came by forfeit, but they also crushed the league-leading Storm by 23 on Thursday. This Mystics team just might be peaking at the perfect time.\n4. Connecticut Sun (18-13) -- Up 1\nThe Sun are still mostly back, having won six of their last seven games. But they did have a slip-up this week against the Sky, which led to some drama on the sidelines. The Sky's blatant pursuit of the single-game assist record in a blowout led to Sun coach Curt Miller fuming about the \"bush league\" tactics.\n5. Phoenix Mercury (18-14) -- Up 1\nThe Mercury have won consecutive games for the first time since late June, which is a good, obviously, and with the standings still quite jumbled, they're still in right there with a chance to snag a top-four seed. On the whole, they've still struggled without Sancho Lyttle, but Sunday's big win over the Sparks was an encouraging sign.\n6. Los Angeles Sparks (18-13) -- Down 3\nFor the first time since the WNBA went to their new playoff format, the Sparks will be forced to play a single-elimination game. Now, the only question is, will it be one or two? Due to their current two-game skid, which included a loss to the Dream on Thursday, the Sparks cannot catch Atlanta for the No. 2 seed. But there's still plenty to play for, as Candace Parker and Co. will want to avoid having to play two single-elimination games just to make the semi-finals.\n7. Minnesota Lynx (17-14) -- No movement\nThey're still the Lynx, and they still have Maya Moore and Sylvia Fowles, but the signs are not good. They've beaten just one playoff team since the early July, and the injury list is growing, with Danielle Robinson now looking unlikely to be ready for the postseason. Against the top teams -- such as on Sunday against the Storm -- they just look a bit overmatched.\n8. Dallas Wings (14-17) -- No movement\nWelp! (See above)\n9. Las Vegas Aces (13-18) -- No movement\nThanks to the Wings' absolute collapse over the last few weeks, the Aces are still alive in the playoff race. They're one game back of the Wings with three games to play, including a matchup Friday between the teams in Dallas. If the Aces can win that game, they really might have a chance of pulling this thing off considering the Wings' tough remaining schedule.\n10. Chicago Sky (11-20) -- No movement\nThe Sky became the third team eliminated from playoff contention with their loss to the Sun on Sunday. It's honestly surprising and a bit impressive they nearly made it to the final week before being officially eliminated, but that won't matter much to the team. Also, Courtney Vandersloot is still on pace to set single-season records for both assists per game and total assists.\n11. Indiana Fever (5-26) -- No movement\nThe Fever are pretty much just running out the clock here on another rough season. It's been nice to see Kelsey Mitchell's efficiency start to improve a bit here lately after a brutal July. She still hasn't been as good as she was early in the season, but things are at least moving in the right direction. Tiffany Mitchell has had some encouraging games lately as well.\n12. New York Liberty (7-23) -- No movement\nThe Liberty ended last season on a 10-game winning streak, and now they're in danger of doing the opposite to close out this campaign. They've lost nine in a row, with even Tina Charles' brilliance unable to lift them out of this rut."

            "Eric Hartline / USA TODAY Sports\nThere was some worry that rain would spoil Saturday night's Stadium Series game between the Penguins and Flyers, possibly even cutting it short after just two periods. Ultimately, though, fans got to see all three periods and then some in Philadelphia.\nThe Flyers managed to rally and prevail in a dramatic 4-3 overtime victory against their cross-state rivals in the elements at Lincoln Financial Field. Philadelphia scored two goals late in the third period, including a game-tying goal from Jakub Voracek with 20 seconds remaining in regulation, to force the extra period. It only took a few minutes for Flyers captain Claude Giroux to seal the win with the golden goal in overtime.\nIt was an exciting finish and a big-time win for the Flyers, who are still trying to hang tough in the Eastern Conference playoff race. But as is usually the case with these outdoor NHL games, it was as much about the spectacle and the atmosphere as it was about the actual game being played on the ice.\nThe rain may have made things a little messier than planned, but the game still brought plenty of action and plenty of awesome visuals. Here are some of the best photos from the event.\nJames Lang / USATSI\nBill Streicher / USATSI\nDrew Hallowell / Getty Images\nDrew Hallowell / Getty Images\nBill Streicher / USATSI\nDrew Hallowell / Getty Images\nBill Streicher / USATSI\nDrew Hallowell / Getty Images\nBill Streicher / USATSI\nEric Hartline / USATSI\nEric Hartline / USATSI\nDrew Hallowell / Getty Images\nEric Hartline / USATSI\nEric Hartline / USATSI\nEric Hartline / USATSI\nEric Hartline / USATSI\nEric Hartline / USATSI\nBRUCE BENNETT / Getty Images\nEric Hartline / USATSI\nEric Hartline / USATSI\nBRUCE BENNETT / Getty Images\nEric Hartline / USATSI\nBill Streicher / USATSI"

            "After the Cleveland Cavaliers chose University of Alabama guard Collin Sexton as the eighth overall selection in last Thursday\u2019s NBA draft, their night of work had effectively ended. However, despite coming up short in acquiring a second-round pick, the Cavaliers did manage to sign three undrafted players for their summer league roster that offer plenty of intriguing possibilities.\nThose three players are: forward Billy Preston from the University of Kansas; forward Bonzie Colson from the University of Notre Dame; and guard Dakota Mathias from Purdue University. The 6-foot-10 Preston never actually played an official game for the Jayhawks before he left due to off-the-court issues and then playing overseas. Both the 6-foot-6 Colson and 6-foot-4 Mathias played four years at their respective schools.\nPreston is a former five-star recruit who has plenty of raw athletic talent when it comes to shooting, shot-blocking and defense. Colson racked up plenty of double-doubles during his time with the Fighting Irish, but missed most of this past season\u2019s second half due to injury. Despite his size, he\u2019s reported to have a 7-foot wingspan. Rounding out this trio, Mathias was a long-range threat for the Boilermakers and could potentially develop as an eventual replacement for the 37-year-old Kyle Korver.\nThe best-case scenario for the three players is that they make the final roster in October. However, a more realistic appraisal is that the trio develops their professional game for the year with the Canton Charge, the Cavaliers\u2019 G League affiliate.\nCavs fans will be able to watch the three players when the team\u2019s summer league squad begins their brief schedule in Las Vegas next month."

Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, last ushered a major gun safety package into law in 2013, after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. The governor successfully corralled recalcitrant Senate Republicans into supporting the so-called Safe Act that expanded the state\u2019s ban on assault weapons, tightened certification requirements, increased criminal penalties for illegal guns and closed private sale loopholes.\nMr. Cuomo has described the Safe Act as one of his signature achievements. But it has also become a rallying cry for some gun owners and Republican politicians who felt it overreached."

            "On a four-game losing skid and without Paul George the OKC Thunder rallied to erase a deficit and grab a must win. Three takeaways offer the details.\nOn the second night of a back to back, the OKC Thunder returned home to Chesapeake Energy Arena to face the Memphis Grizzlies in a Sunday evening matchup. A late game surge gave the Thunder the push they needed to narrowly score a much needed win in an otherwise ugly contest.\nThe OKC Thunder\u2019s post-All-Star slump has seen the team suffer their first four-game slide since starting the 2018-2019 campaign 0-4. To say Sunday night\u2019s home matchup against the lowly Memphis Grizzlies was a \u201cmust win\u201d game for a team currently occupying a spot in the upper echelon of the hotly contested Western Conference would be a slightly exaggerated sentiment, however, having given up four straight, on the verge of giving up the three seed, and about to embark on a four-game road stretch, it certainly could not help but feel like it.\nThunder fans expecting to see that sense of urgency from the team to start the contest, however, would be sorely disappointed as OKC once again came out flat at home against the Grizzlies, spending the majority of the game playing catchup to a Grizzlies squad that, coming into the night, sat 14 games under .500.\nThe OKC Thunder were once again without the services of February\u2019s Western Conference Player of the Month and MVP candidate, Paul George, as he continues to nurse a strained rotator cuff. Billy Donovan again gave the starting nod to Dennis Schroder in an attempt to generate more offensive production, but going into the break, the Thunder trailed 52-46 on colder shooting than the blustery air outside Chesapeake Energy Arena.\nThrough the first half, Oklahoma City logged a lackluster 34.8 percent field goal efficiency, shooting just 25 percent from beyond the arc and 61.1 percent from the charity stripe, while allowing Memphis to shoot 51.3 percent from the floor on 44.4 percent from deep and a perfect 8-8 from the free throw line.\nThe Thunder were unable to make any substantive adjustments at halftime and saw the Grizzlies lead stretch to 13 points in the third and again in the fourth quarter off the hot hand of the newly acquired Avery Bradley.\nMemphis looked poised to steal the win on the road from the home team; however, Oklahoma City was able to string together several consecutive minutes of gritty basketball and escape with the win on the shoulders of gutsy defense and hustle plays that have characterized the OKC Thunder throughout a largely poor shooting first half of the season.\nAlthough OKC was able to walk away with the victory, several aspects of Sunday night\u2019s performance are concerning for a \u201cwin now\u201d team looking to make a deep playoff run. \u201cUgly wins\u201d are still tallied the same in the win column, but this contest was truly ugly. TI offers three takeaways."

        "articles": [
            "Spoiler notice: this review expressly doesn\u2019t spoil any specific plot points in Avengers: Endgame whatsoever, but does discuss general themes, ideas, and cast members.\nIt\u2019s been just over a decade since Marvel Studios launched its flagship franchise of interconnected comics-inspired movies with 2008\u2019s Iron Man, and even now it\u2019s difficult to begin to evaluate how much that franchise has changed the face of filmmaking. After 10 years, 21 films, nearly a dozen television shows, countless tie-in comics and games and merchandising options and viral videos, and billions upon billions of dollars in earnings, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has become the Holy Grail that every major studio is questing after, usually with little success. The MCU films have set off a mania for interconnected multi-platform franchises and multi-film arcs, not to mention a still-growing tide of superhero stories in every possible medium.\nBut while Marvel has expressly laid out a number of formulas that its competitors have struggled to imitate \u2014 from its highly specific mix of action and fast-paced snippy humor to its frequent, unapologetic visual and narrative nods to the most obsessive fans in its midst \u2014 it\u2019s also beginning to break those formulas. Spider-Man: Homecoming followed up on the international hero-on-hero warfare of Captain America: Civil War with a personal little neighborhood story that dialed the MCU stakes way back and reset expectations for the franchise. Thor: Ragnarok placed its story in the hands of Taika Waititi, a comedian with a distinctively deadpan sensibility, and introduced indie-style emotional improv to the superhero world. Avengers: Infinity War let the heroes lose, and lose big \u2014 even killing off many of the series\u2019 flagship characters at the end.\nPhoto: Film Frame / Marvel Studios\nBut nothing so far has broken the Marvel formula quite like Avengers: Endgame, which follows Infinity War by diving deep into the previous film\u2019s feeling of emotional loss and helplessness, exploring it at length, and then expanding into something that isn\u2019t so much a Marvel story as a series of calculated payoffs for a decade of Marvel stories.\nHero movies have a longstanding bad habit of faking a character\u2019s tragic death for a few seconds of pathos, then immediately taking it back \u2014 and Marvel\u2019s parent company, Disney, has a particularly bad track record with this trope, going all the way back to 1937. Avengers: Endgame puts the brakes on that by finally taking its own sweet time in exploring how heroes might deal with grief, loss, survivors\u2019 guilt, and the pervasive feeling of failure. The crowded cast means that no one character gets much time to fully examine their feelings, but directors Anthony and Joe Russo and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely make it clear that they\u2019re all thinking about individual people who died in Infinity War, and how to navigate a future without them.\nEndgame spends so much time on these thoughts that it winds up turning into an extended superhero take on Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u2019s excellently weird HBO series The Leftovers, about survivors navigating the wake of a mass worldwide disappearance. Endgame\u2019s tone is mostly deeply somber \u2014 even when the protagonists formulate a plan and start taking steps, they\u2019re grim and angry. The most purely comic-relief characters barely get out a few dark, barbed chuckle lines along the way, and many of the action scenes are brief and abortive. On top of that, the narrative ends up splitting to put a wide selection of characters in different places, chasing goals in ways that don\u2019t always convey urgency. At times, Endgame feels like Inception, with the mind-bending sense of a dozen equally important things happening all at once, but without the sense of unity or a cohesive, well-modulated buildup. Endgame gives its characters a lot of downtime to consider the ramifications of their moves, or to explore personal sidetracks that drop the momentum off to nothing.\nPhoto: Film Frame / Marvel Studios\nAll of which leaves Endgame feeling like an odd mess of a movie. If a film with this exact structure and pacing (and 181-minute run time) was made with original characters, critics would eviscerate it as self-indulgent, sloppy, and incoherent. Viewers would probably meet it with the kind of cult love and mass indifference that greeted similarly ambitious, effects-packed, narratively sprawling projects like Jupiter Ascending or Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets.\nBut these aren\u2019t original characters. They\u2019re beloved heroes who\u2019ve been built up in the public eye for so long that anytime they cover new emotional ground, it can feel more significant than whatever the latest magical McGuffin or fight for the future of the universe might elicit. Generally, when a superhero glowers and grimaces and can\u2019t express any emotion but fear and anger, it feels frustratingly familiar. But when endlessly striving Captain America (Chris Evans) or smart-mouthing Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) or swaggering god of thunder Thor (Chris Hemsworth) are reduced to that state, it feels like the world really has shifted in a meaningful way.\nAnd Endgame\u2019s filmmakers pack their story with payoffs for the longest-term fans, reminding them how well they know these characters\u2019 existing emotional arcs and deep-seated insecurities, and drawing those ideas out at length. Tony Stark\u2019s constant war between arrogance and his heavy sense of responsibility, Thor\u2019s buried insecurities, Steve Rogers\u2019 deep-down ache for everything he lost when he was jolted out of his own time \u2014 they all get some screen time, ramped up to new heights by the latest crisis.\nPhoto: Film Frame / Marvel Studios\nInevitably, not everyone gets an examination worth having, or a storyline that lives up to the 10-year buildup. Sidekick characters like Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) get plenty of screentime without doing anything new. Primary characters like Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) are key to the action in ways that become actively frustrating as they don\u2019t develop past their familiar baselines. And the most-changed character, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), goes through yet another significant evolution in his Hulk history, without ever contending with what the latest changes mean in this story, or could mean in future stories.\nAnd yet. The shadow of Infinity War is a stark, dark one, and Endgame only has one real job: to move the MCU forward past Infinity War\u2019s climactic horror. Every moment of Endgame feels like it was made with that in mind \u2014 to convey the audience past the shock and into grief, anger, hope, and tremendous excitement. It was made for the kind of fans that will collectively gasp in shock at every significant twist (and there are a few huge ones), then cheer in relief at every climactic blow for the future integrity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\nWith that in mind, Endgame doesn\u2019t just play as a wild tangle of interacting plotlines and self-indulgent personal rabbit holes for these characters. It plays as an endless series of payoffs, in some cases for long arcs \u2014 like Tony Stark\u2019s standoffish, dismissive relationship with Spider-Man (Tom Holland), whom he starts the film mourning in a passionate, personal way \u2014 and in other cases, for the tiniest of passing jokes from other MCU movies. The entire film is constructed of callbacks, references, reminders, and reminiscences. It\u2019s full of catharsis for its characters and its audience, sometimes through immense battles, sometimes through elaborate low-key conversations between characters, and sometimes through tiny, abrupt moments. It feels like an anniversary project, a look back through the ol\u2019 MCU scrapbook, and a big collective group hug after Infinity War.\nPhoto: Film Frame / Marvel Studios\nEndgame was never designed to stand on its own as a single well-crafted movie, and it was never designed to follow the MCU formula. It was designed to cap a decade of buildup around a single gigantic story. (Even if Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige has confirmed that Endgame isn\u2019t the final film in this arc \u2014 the upcoming Spider-Man: Far from Home is.) In that sense, it\u2019s certainly a triumph: it\u2019s ambitious, towering, and above all, daring in its difference."

            "8 Mar 2019 15.46 GMT Adam Zampa speaks \u201cCollectively we bowled really well. The quicks were amazing with the new ball. Virat is an unbelievable batter in some serious nick and it was nice to get him out when we did. I definitely do not want to call him my bunny! I was under pressure after he hit me for two boundaries but I tried to keep my cool and he missed it, luckily. I feel like I\u2019m bowling well at the moment, especially in tandem with Nathan. The message from the coaches is to continually look for wickets. You\u2019re gonna go for runs so an attacking mindset goes a long way.\u201d\n8 Mar 2019 15.44 GMT That\u2019s a fine win for Australia, which keeps the series alive. The return to form of Aaron Finch is a happy bonus, and they will be particularly pleased that they won the game despite another immense innings from Virat Kohli. Usman Khawaja also made his first ODI hundred to continue his excellent form, while Pat Cummins, Jhye Richardson and Adam Zampa all bowled very well. Cummins and Richardson both ended with three for 37, while Zampa took three vital wickets: Dhoni, Jadhav and Kohli.\nUpdated at 15.46 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 15.41 GMT AUSTRALIA WIN BY 32 RUNS! WICKET! India 281 all out (Kuldeep c Finch b Cummins 10) That\u2019ll do. Pat Cummins, whose new-ball spell put Australia on top, finishes the job when Kuldeep holes out to the captain Finch.\n8 Mar 2019 15.39 GMT 48th over: India 281-9 (Kuldeep 10, Bumrah 0) \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Dennis Johns. \u201cJust discussing with a friend about Kohli\u2019s 41 ODI centuries and we got to thinking: what year do you reckon England reached 41 ODI tons as a team/nation state/whatever? For what it\u2019s worth, he\u2019s saying 1997 and I\u2019m saying 2003. Neither of us are adept enough at StatsGuru to figure it out. I know this is a sorrowful admission to make on the OBO. Fancy a crack to settle it? (And shared enjoyment of how lamentable England were at one day cricket for basically ever.)\u201d If my Statsguruing is correct, the answer is \u2026 22 February 1996.\nUpdated at 15.39 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 15.38 GMT WICKET! India 281-9 (Shami c Cummins b Richardson 8) Australia are one wicket away. Shami smacks two jaunty boundaries before miscuing a slower bouncer to cover.\n8 Mar 2019 15.34 GMT WICKET! India 273-8 (Jadeja c Maxwell b Richardson 24) A second wicket for the excellent Jhye Richardson. Jadeja drags a slower ball to mid-on, where Maxwell takes an easy catch. Australia are two wickets or 17 balls anyway from a fine victory.\n8 Mar 2019 15.33 GMT 47th over: India 273-7 (Jadeja 24, Kuldeep 10) Jadeja swings Maxwell sweetly over midwicket for six. That\u2019s an impressive, defiant stroke, and he manages to keep the strike with a single off the last ball. Ten from the over.\n8 Mar 2019 15.30 GMT 46th over: India 263-7 (Jadeja 15, Kuldeep 8) Another quiet over from Richardson leaves India needing 51 from 24 balls. This game is done and dunner. \u201cNow that the game is drawing to a mundane close,\u201d says Surendranath Halder, \u201cmay I ask what your opinion about the five balls per innings idea by Abhijato would be?\u201d Hi Abhijato. I think it\u2019s a bad idea: gimmicky, messy and unnecessary. But I\u2019m frequently wrong, so there\u2019s that.\nUpdated at 15.31 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 15.26 GMT 45th over: India 260-7 (Jadeja 13, Kuldeep 7) Lyon finishes with figures of 10-0-57-1. India need 54 from 30 balls; don\u2019t we all.\n8 Mar 2019 15.23 GMT 44th over: India 253-7 (Jadeja 13, Kuldeep 2) This match is all over bar the clouting. The returning Richardson concedes only two from his seventh over, pushing the required rate above 10 an over. He\u2019s been impresisve today and would be in my World Cup squad, for whatever that\u2019s worth. (Clue: nowt.)\nUpdated at 15.24 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 15.19 GMT 43rd over: India 251-7 (Jadeja 12) That was the last ball of the over, so India need 63 from 42 balls. \u201cA few weeks ago a friend of mine posted a pic on social media of himself in a Caribbean bar with Viv,\u201d says Pete Salmon. \u201cI was able to shoot off a question to ask the great man: \u201c\u2018When Viv is trying to sleep does he imagine that he is a 48-year-old, slim white copy-editor from the UK, like I imagine I\u2019m him?\u2019 \u201cViv\u2019s answer was, \u2018No.\u2019 \u201cMy greatest sporting moment.\u201d\n8 Mar 2019 15.18 GMT WICKET! India 251-7 (Shankar c Richardson b Lyon 32) That should be the match for Australia. Shankar, who slog swept Lyon mightily for four earlier in the over, tries to repeat the shot and holes out to Richardson on the boundary.\n8 Mar 2019 15.14 GMT 42nd over: India 242-6 (Shankar 27, Jadeja 9) Shankar hits the first boundary since the dismissal of Kohli, driving Zampa high over extra cover. Lovely shot, that. Zampa completes an expensive but probably matchwinning spell with figures of 10-0-70-3. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Dean Kinsella. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Mr Kohli is admired, revered, idolised or whatever but I tell you what - he\u2019s bloody good at batting! I feel that after he mastered English conditions last time around, we could see something extraordinary from him in this summer\u2019s World Cup. He has the ability, passion and drive to carry his team with him (like today) in the same way that Mr Tendulkar did. There is no-one on his level in world cricket and I think that makes India firm favourites to win this summer.\u201d I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d make India favourites, firm or otherwise, but it wouldn\u2019t be remotely surprising if Kohli completed his exorcism of that 2014 series by scoring 162 not out to beat England in the final. He\u2019s so far ahead of everyone else, especially in ODIs. It\u2019s like he\u2019s found a cheat code for batting.\n8 Mar 2019 15.08 GMT 41st over: India 231-6 (Shankar 19, Jadeja 7) Replays show that Jadeja would have been given out had Australia been able to review. Even after a decade of DRS, greedy bowlers are still frittering away views. The earlier one from Glenn Maxwell was a shocker. It shouldn\u2019t matter, however, because the game is getting away from India. The tempo has changed completely since the departure of Kohli.\nUpdated at 15.09 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 15.05 GMT 40th over: India 227-6 (Shankar 17, Jadeja 5) Jadeja, missing a sweep, survives an LBW appeal from Zampa. I think it pitched outside leg. Jadeja survives an even better LBW appeal later in the over, but Australia cannot review it because of Maxwell\u2019s earlier indulgence. That looked out. India need 87 from 60 balls.\nUpdated at 15.06 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 15.01 GMT 39th over: India 223-6 (Shankar 16, Jadeja 3) \u201cFor my money, Viv was the better all-round player,\u201d says Richard O\u2019Hagan. \u201cA better bowler and fielder, but also (though not by much) a better batsman. Only Sachin and Lara since have had the same dominance over bowling attacks for a sustained period of time.\u201d I suspect he was too, from everything I\u2019ve seen and read. Lara is the most destructive and exciting player I\u2019ve seen (post-1988), but Kohli\u2019s consistency is terrifying.\n8 Mar 2019 14.57 GMT 38th over: India 221-6 (Shankar 15, Jadeja 2) Quite a comeback from Zampa, who is such an intelligent and courageous bowler. Australia are big favourites now. It was another amazing innings from Kohli: 123 from 95 balls with 14 fours and a six. The ICC need to introduce a handicap for this man. He should start every innings on -20.\nUpdated at 15.01 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 14.54 GMT WICKET! India 219-6 (Kohli b Zampa 123) Silencio. Kohli has gone! He hit Zampa for two stunning boundaries off the first two balls but was bowled by the third, missing an extravagant flick at a ball that skidded on to hit leg stump. It was a poor shot, actually, as if he got carried away with the first two boundaries. Zampa celebrates with teammates. Photograph: Aijaz Rahi/AP\nUpdated at 15.14 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 14.52 GMT 37th over: India 211-5 (Kohli 115, Shankar 15) Australia are under the pump, but they know the wicket of Kohli would instantly make them odds-on favourites. Pat Cummins returns to the attack with that in mind. He almost gets Shankar, who inside edges just past the stumps, and concedes six from the over. India need 103 from 78 balls. \u201cAs Kohli has reached his 41st century in ODIs, I would like to share that I was there at the Eden Gardens when he scored his first hundred for India,\u201d says Avitaj Mitra. \u201c24th December, 2009. India needed 320 odd against Sri Lanka. Sachin and Sehwag went cheaply.Gambhir and Kohli got hundreds, India won by 7 wickets. Gambhir won the man of the match award, which he graciously shared with Kohli. Lovely day, all around. I knew then he was good, but nobody could have predicted he would be this good.\u201d No, I doubt even he thought he would be this good.\n8 Mar 2019 14.47 GMT 36th over: India 205-5 (Kohli 111, Shankar 13) Kohli scorches Zampa down the ground, where the diving Shaun Marsh does exceptionally well to save two runs. Kohli takes Marsh out of the equation next ball, cuffing a slog sweep over him at long on for six. It wasn\u2019t perfectly struck but there was enough on it to clear the ropes. Shankar survives a precautionary stumping referral \u2013 Carey didn\u2019t even appeal \u2013 and then edges very fine for four. Fourteen runs from the over.\n8 Mar 2019 14.44 GMT 35th over: India 191-5 (Kohli 104, Shankar 9) Maxwell\u2019s fourth over is extremely eventful. Kohli is dropped on 98, a sharp deflection to the keeper Carey. Shankar survives an abysmal LBW review after missing a sweep; the ball pitched well outside leg stump and Australia have lost their review. And then, after being reprieved, Kohli reaches another awesome hundred. I don\u2019t use that word lightly, dude. It\u2019s his 41st in ODIs and has come from only 85 balls. I\u2019m trying not to get carried away, and I didn\u2019t see Sir Viv in his pomp, but Kohli might be the best batsman I\u2019ve ever seen. Kohli raises his bat to celebrate scoring a century. Photograph: Aijaz Rahi/AP\nUpdated at 15.15 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 14.39 GMT Fantasy league department The friendly folk below the line have set up a fantasy league for this season\u2019s English County Championship. I did it last year and it was great fun; no I didn\u2019t win; I\u2019d invite you to shut your mouth. But if you want to try this year\u2019s, click here and use this code: FCABNGCJ.\nUpdated at 14.40 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 14.35 GMT 34th over: India 186-5 (Kohli 98, Shankar 8) Another thrifty over from the impressive Zampa, including one delivery that bounces sharply and forces Kohli to abort his attacking stroke. That\u2019s drinks.\nUpdated at 14.36 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 14.32 GMT 33rd over: India 182-5 (Kohli 96, Shankar 6) Shankar gets his first boundary with a classy stroke, steering Maxwell through backward point. He\u2019s beaten all ends up by the next delivery, which slips through the gate and misses the off stump. Carey couldn\u2019t take the ball cleanly, thoguh I don\u2019t think it was a stumping chance. Seven from the over.\nUpdated at 14.34 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 14.26 GMT WICKET! India 174-5 (Jadhav LBW b Zampa 26) Australia get a much-needed wicket, if not the wicket they really needed, when Jadhav misses a sweep at Zampa and is plumb LBW.\n8 Mar 2019 14.23 GMT 31st over: India 169-4 (Kohli 90, Jadhav 26) With Australia in urgent need of a wicket, Richardson returns to the attack. Instead he goes for consecutive boundaries, with Kohli flicking an inswinger to fine leg and creaming another through the covers on the run. That was a shot of exhilarating contempt.\n8 Mar 2019 14.20 GMT 30th over: India 160-4 (Kohli 81, Jadhav 26) Not for the first time today, Lyon is too straight and Kohli works him very fine for four. Replays suggest this one may have only hit the pad but runs were given. Kohli survives a run-out chance later in the over when Jadhav takes a tight single to Maxwell at midwicket. He would have been out with a direct hit, and Maxwell screams with frustration as the ball whistles past the stumps.\n8 Mar 2019 14.16 GMT 29th over: India 153-4 (Kohli 75, Jadhav 25) \u201cAs an Indian, let me jump in,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. \u201c1) Virat Kohli was genuinely hated by most fellow nationals above the age of forty when he was a young kid showing the finger to the Aussie crowds. Around that time he played the blockbuster innings against Sri Lanka in the tri-series where he smoked Malinga to make people take notice. After assuming the Test captaincy, he\u2019s grown to be seen as a legend in the making. Since 2016, he started making double tons and becoming more mature on the field as well as with the press. He\u2019s been hailed as an idol freely despite his new-age approach with infinite tattoos and expletives. He\u2019s calmed down, and proportionally India has loved him evermore. \u201c2) Dhoni was an unknown face until his 180-odd against Sri Lanka in a chase while opening. He went on to win the World Cup and is the stoic legend everyone adores, except for that period where he dropped senior players in a VB series. He won back the love emphatically when they defeated Australia in the finals. \u201c3) Sachin is Sachin.\u201d But is Sachin as Sachin does?\nUpdated at 14.16 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 14.13 GMT 28th over: India 151-4 (Kohli 74, Jadhav 24) Lyon returns to the attack and hurries through a good over \u2013 three from it. India need 163 from 132 balls.\n8 Mar 2019 14.10 GMT 27th over: India 148-4 (Kohli 73, Jadhav 22) Glenn Maxwell replaces Adam Zampa and almost grabs Kohli with his second ball! It turned through the gate from around the wicket and beat Carey en route for four leg byes. Maxwell went up for the LBW and also wanted a review, but Finch decided it was too high. Replays suggest there was an inside-edge anyway. It\u2019s another expensive over, with Jadhav scorching a flat, one-bounce four down the ground. India scored 74 from the first 18 overs; they\u2019ve added 74 more in the last nine. \u201cThis is with regards to Geoff Wignall\u2019s observation,\u201d says Avitaj Mitra. \u201cI think he\u2019s spot on. Tendulkar is loved and revered mostly because he was the only one who would single-handedly drag India to improbable victories especially during the early and mid-1990s (before the emergence of Dravid and Ganguly). Dhoni of course is more loved because he brought back the World Cup trophy, plus his ability to always remain a fair person, even under severe pressure (recalling Ian Bell in 2011 springs to mind). Kohli, despite his frankly staggering skills, especially in run-chases, still rubs people up the wrong way, mostly because of his brash attitude, win-at-all-costs mentality and \u2018colourful language\u2019 when things don\u2019t always go his way.\u201d\nUpdated at 14.10 GMT\n8 Mar 2019 14.06 GMT 26th over: India 137-4 (Kohli 72, Jadhav 16) Kohli blasts Stoinis inside-out over extra cover for four, another devastatingly good shot. And he ends the over with consecutive boundaries, a flick off the pads followed by a delightful push-drive through extra cover. This is simply awesome batting from Kohli, who has 72 from 60 balls. \u201cInspiration is a funny thing,\u201d says James Walsh. \u201cFollowing your OBO coverage today while smoothing out a short sci fi play I wrote for luck. One of the characters is a messianic tech genius CEO, who is in denial about how his latest product has merged all possible realities together into a kind of Fukuyama end-of-history soup. Only I appear to have named him Phil Sawyer.\u201d I shudder to think what you\u2019ve done with Mac Millings.\n8 Mar 2019 14.01 GMT 25th over: India 123-4 (Kohli 59, Jadhav 15) A brilliant stroke from Jadhav, who flashes a sweep through midwicket for four off Zampa."

            "The husband of B. Smith is opening up about his relationship with another woman as he cares for the famed restaurateur and lifestyle guru amid her ongoing battle with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nDan Gasby, 64, first went public with his romance with Alex Lerner, 53, back in December, in a post on the Facebook page he shares with B. Smith, who he has been married to for 26 years.\nOn Monday, The Washington Post published a profile of the trio, with Gasby and Lerner explaining in their own words how their relationship came to be.\n\u201cIf This is Us and Modern Family came together, it would be us,\u201d Gasby told The Post.\nAlex Lerner and Dan Gasby. Karsten Moran for The Washington Post via Getty Images\nThe two met in the summer of 2017 at a Hamptons bar, and struck up a conversation. Romance didn\u2019t come at first. \u201cWe were friends,\u201d Lerner, a divorced mother of three, told The Post, adding that she had socialized with Smith, 69, previously at charity events. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go out with a married man.\u201d\nBut at a breakfast with Gasby and Smith one morning, Lerner realized, \u201cThis is not a man cheating on his wife.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I admire about him is that he takes care of her,\u201d she explained to The Post.\nLerner, in turn, has also begun taking care of Smith. She has a room in Gasby and Smith\u2019s East Hampton home, where she stays when she visits from her Manhattan apartment.\n\u201cIf I can be compassionate to her \u2026 if I can do anything for her, it makes me feel good,\u201d she told The Post, her voice \u201cbreaking,\u201d according to the outlet. \u201cIf it is giving her something to drink, or making her something to eat \u2014 she loves to eat \u2014 I feel good.\u201d\nCJ Rivera/Getty Images\nSmith was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s six years ago, after Gasby noticed her become increasingly \u2014 and uncharacteristically \u2014 moody and forgetful.\nThe news came as she was continuing to build her empire. Over the years, she opened three eponymous restaurants, wrote three cookbooks, and hosted the nationally syndicated show, B. Smith With Style. She also made history as the first African American woman to grace the cover of Mademoiselle magazine, as well as the first African American woman to launch her own brand of home goods (at Bed, Bath and Beyond.)\nHer restaurants have all closed now, with Smith and Gasby instead turning their attention to Alzheimer\u2019s advocacy work. They even chronicled their experience with the disease in the 2016 memoir, Before I Forget: Love, Hope, Help, and Acceptance in Our Fight Against Alzheimer\u2019s.\nAt the time, Gasby told PEOPLE that taking care of Smith was a round-the-clock job. \u201cIt\u2019s the toughest thing I\u2019ve ever dealt with,\u201d he said. \u201cAnybody who is an Alzheimer\u2019s care giver knows exactly what other caregivers are going through. It\u2019s 24/7. The complexity and the intensity of it is very tough.\u201d\nCaring for Smith \u201cis overwhelming most of the time,\u201d Gasby admitted to PEOPLE then. \u201cI\u2019m taking it one day at a time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely difficult. At times I feel like I am between the Titanic and the iceberg and the water is cold and it makes a difference which one I get on.\u201d\nRELATED: Family Fights to Save 6 Year Old with Childhood Alzheimer\u2019s: \u2018He\u2019s the Light of My Life,\u2019 Says Mom\nFrom there, it appears Smith\u2019s health has only gotten worse. The Post reported that the disease has \u201cravaged [Smith\u2019s] brain, jumbling her memories, [and] turning her sentences into alphabet soup.\u201d\nGasby has told Smith about his relationship with Lerner, though it doesn\u2019t seem to register.\nHis daughter from a previous marriage Dana, 32, has given her blessing to their relationship. \u201cWhen he told me, I was like, \u2018Thank God. I\u2019m happy,\u2019 \u201d Dana told The Post, explaining that her father has not abandoned Smith, who raised Dana since she was young. \u201cB. is my mom \u2026 She\u2019s in this house. She\u2019s here every day.\u201d\nStill, there have been critics of Gasby and Lerner\u2019s coupling. \u201cYou don\u2019t bring your mistress in the house where your WIFE lives,\u201d one wrote online, according to The Post. \u201cShe\u2019s not dead.\u201d\nOn Facebook, Monday, Gasby addressed his critics. \u201cThe idiots and ignorant people calling for my arrest and saying B is or has ever been abused \u2014 I only wish someone in your immediate family has Alzheimer\u2019s so you can see feel and experience the pain of millions of people across this country so you can know first hand what it\u2019s like to care 24/7/365 for someone who can no longer care for themselves!\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cI love my wife but I can\u2019t let her take away my life!\u201d he added. \u201c5-10 years from now when many of you who will have an almost predestined meeting with Alzheimer\u2019s because of genetics, obesity, and a myriad of inflammatory diseases, you\u2019ll be wishing for someone to share moments with and ease the pain of loneliness and despair.\u201d\nHe continued. \u201cThe clock is ticking. I know I can and have [managed] this, but can you do it too?\u201d"

            "Rashan Gary , DE, Michigan\nAtlanta Falcons Recent Recap\nBefore discussing the pick, let\u2019s take a deep dive into to the Atlanta Falcons and their needs. When thinking about who the Falcons would draft, one question continued to pop into my head: WHO AND WHAT ARE THE ATLANTA FALCONS?! Seriously! I can\u2019t understand that franchise one bit, specifically in recent years! What I do know about them is that Doug Pederson has a major stake in that franchise after owning them for 3 STRAIGHT YEARS(INCLUDING PLAYOFFS). Just take a look at them under Dan Quinn. They were 8-8, suffered a crushing loss the SB, lost in the Divisional round, and went 7-9 this year. Seems Successful. On paper you have a great team with a Star(Above Average) QB, Franchise RB, 2 Great OL(Jake Matthews and Alex Mack), Julio \u201cFREAKING\u201d Jones, bunch of other good receivers, Adequate D-Line, Deion Jones and Co, Desmond Trufant, Keanu Neal and Ricardo Allen, and a Defensive Minded Head Coach to elevate the defense!!! That is one heck of a team with loads of star power! Where are the championships? What happened last year? Is Dan Quinn the answer? The Falcons had all the talent to be the NFC champion the past 4 seasons! This years draft and season will be defining for the Falcons. Contracts are expiring and the team is getting older. Tick Tock!\nLast year, the Falcons were 7-9. They had some major injuries at RB, Offensive Line, LB, Safety, and kicker. Looking at what happened in free agency, they lost Tevin Coleman, starting corners Robert Alford and Brian Poole, Bruce Irvin, some members along their offensive line, and franchise kicker Matt Bryant. They also did not make a major splash in free agency signings. They signed Offensive Lineman James Carpenter from the Jets(Biggest Signing), some other Offensive Lineman, Luke Stocker(Blocking TE from Tennessee), and SUPER BOWL 52 Victor Kenjon Barner. Their current major needs are Offensive Line(Right Tackle and Guard), Defensive Line, and Cornerback. With the Offensive trend in Free Agency, it seems to be gearing up for a heavy defensive draft for the Falcons. Ok, I finished my Falcon rant. Let\u2019s dive into the draft and the pick!\nInside the Draft Room\nIn order to get an understanding of my mindset when choosing the Pick, I\u2019ll going to relay to you how the selection of Rashan Gary happened through an EXCLUSIVE, exaggerated, Dave Spadaro-ish, inside the BGN mock Draft War room point of view.\n\u201cIt was late at night. Picks in the BGN Mock draft were flying off the board. I studied and went through many scenarios of who could be left on the board, when the Falcons were on the clock. A loud moan was heard when Jawaan Taylor, a premiere Tackle of the future, went off the board. All focus stayed on our board wondering what was to come next. Gasps came at pick 9 as the Lions selected Ed Oliver, another Highly rated player on my board. It was Nail Biting time! Who is going to be there when I pick? Is there going to be a highly rated player or will I have to reach?! The Dolphins finally selected and the long wait was over. I was now on the clock. A great player had fell in the draft and I had all intentions of stopping that slide and snatching him up. I waited with anticipation and came to a final conclusion. With the 14th pick in the 2019 BGN Mock Draft, the Atlanta Falcons select Rashan Gary, DL, Michigan.\u201d\nRashan Gary (Measurables and Production/High Recruit)\nIn seeing what all the mock drafts and draft analysts have circulating around, I saw Rashan Gary\u2019s name frequently in the top 10. I was not totally familiar with him so I took a look at some tapes/highlights and there is A LOT to like! Some great Offensive Linemen and Defensive Players were taken before my pick in this BGN Mock draft, but I feel I went BPA(Best Player Available). I love Rashan Gary and was so happy he fell to the Falcons\u2019 pick. To my naked eye he is a BEAST. A big, powerful, and speedy Defensive Line prospect. Gary was the best recruit coming out of high school in 2016. He can play both Defensive End and Defensive Tackle. I also believe he could fit in a 3-4 or a 4-3 defense. He is a dream prospect for defensive coach and Dan Quinn would be all over him. More details about Gary below:\nRashan Gary Obligatory Spider Graph Picture via Mockdraftable:\nExplosive - His best weapon as a pass rusher is his powerful first step. Erupts off the ball and has the speed and power to get around the best Offensive Tackles.\nBest Pass Rush technique- Analysts say \u201cSpeed-to-power is his go-to move. He Bull-rushes and uses his long-arms to knock his opponent off-balance.\u201d\nMore moves- Needs to add more pass rush moves to his repertoire, but is effective.\nRun Defense - This dude is a great run stuffer. He is huge, fast, and tackles well. He uses his unique power to push off centers and guards and knock down some RBs.\nHitting the Hole- He could learn to find gaps more quickly. Sometimes he gets into trouble reading the wrong hole, in situations where he could have gotten the tackle.\nTackling - One of the Best tacklers in the Draft. Able to get his hands on an opponent and throw them to the ground. Also great at \u201csafely\u201d laying the wood on opposing QBs. Don\u2019t want to get a Roughing the Passer flag these days!\nNatural Position DE or DT- Gary has the ability to play all around the D-Line and in any scheme with great power, tackling, and speed. I would play him at Defensive End where he has a chance to be most productive and move him inside on any down to rush or stop the run. He can be on the field from Day 1, but may need more crafting to be a full-time starter.\nEffort- Gary is an emotional player. His power is dictated by emotions. Some take this to mean he takes off on some plays, but I don\u2019t see it. I would go as far to say the guy has a high powered motor who can go up against the best Offensive tackles with a chance for disruption all game.\nAthleticism - Elite size, power and speed. Tested terrific for an edge defender except for his average 3-cone. Had a speedy 4.59, 40 yard dash at 277 pounds. Some may want him to add to his frame to play interior defensive line or add more muscle to become even better on the edge.\nMy Comparison and Sack Numbers\nMy player comp for Gary is Michael Bennett. The guy has tremendous power and great hands. He is going to be a major problem for Offensive Lines throughout the league. His run stuffing/tackling ability is also very strong. Michael Bennett\u2019s best attributes are elite power and good run stuffing, same attributes as Gary. Where they differ, is in terms of sack numbers. Gary was moved around the D-Line during his time at Michigan playing multiple positions. He had 6 sacks in 2017 and 3.5 this season. He was also bothered by a shoulder injury early in the season this year. These numbers are a little alarming and could cause him to fall in the draft, but sack numbers don\u2019t mean everything. There is a way to be productive and disruptive without the numbers, as we see in Philly with Fletcher Cox and Brandon Graham. We know they are great relentless pass rushers, but they may not get all the sacks/credit. Overall, I think he will be very productive in an NFL system, with NFL coaches, finding his best fit. Placing Gary next to Tak McKinley, Vic Beasley, and Grady Garrett is a MONSTER combination!\nGary Highlight Video:\nA True Boom or Bust\nMany see Gary as a Boom or Bust candidate. I believe Gary is the definition of a Boom or Bust Candidate. Gary has all the attributes to be a terrific NFL player. He has the ceiling, with a good D-Coordinator, to become one of the most disruptive pass rushers in the league who can be placed inside and outside on the line. He would not suffer in a scheme change, as he is very athletic to play in a 3-4 scheme. I could Gary become a Brandon Graham as well. Meaning, he could take time to adjust to the league, before building up his sack numbers and reputation. Worst case scenario, is that he would be unable to find a natural fit along the Defensive Line. He would still be a good rotational player in this scenario, just not a star starter. Can\u2019t get anymore Boom/Bust than that!\nEd Oliver Slide? More like the Rashan Gary Slide\nWe heard all along throughout the past few months that there could be an Ed Oliver slide, but due to an impressive combine and pro-day, it seems less likely to occur. What seems to be occurring is a Rashan Gary slide. Recent mocks have Gary landing somewhere in the top 10 to the Raiders pick at 24. BGN\u2019 s own Ben Solak, in his latest 6.0 mock draft, has the Falcons taking Gary at 14 as well.(Great Minds think alike!) I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll make it out the top 12, but if we have another QB frenzy draft, Dan Quinn and Co would love to scoop him up!\nFit on the Falcons and Falcons Draft History\nThe Falcons don\u2019t have many \u201cneeds\u201d, but the spots where they have \u201cneeds\u201d must be filled with good and productive players. Rashan Gary was the best player on the board in our BGN mock draft and filled a Falcons\u2019 need. The Falcons also need a Right Tackle and Cornerbacks. I believe they have addressed the Offensive Line well so far in free agency and should find a developmental Right Tackle later in the draft. This draft also has some aggressive cornerbacks and there should be some good ones that fall to round 2. Addressing the D-Line does not have to stop with Gary. Another interior D-Lineman could be taken in the mid rounds as well. The Falcons in the first round have drafted all across the board in recent years with Jake Matthews, Vic Beasley, Keanu Neal, Tak McKinley, and Calvin Ridley. I believe the Falcons will stick to Dan Quinn\u2019s Defensive Background this year in the draft and would go bonkers for Rashan Gary.\nGreat Character and an Awesome Mama\nIn relating to character, Rashan Gary is a standup guy. I recently saw a special on the NFL Network about Gary and his close relationship with his mother. It was a wonderful look into Gary\u2019s life and the support he receives from a great mother. The video shares a story about his mother, Jennifer, who commentated on some of his high school games on the team\u2019s PA system. It shows the dedication and strong relationship that Rashan has with Jennifer and that support will always be there. This is great to see, especially when a few years ago another player\u2019s mother decided to show her \u201csupport\u201d for them on TV.\nDoes anyone remember Annie Apple? She is the mother of Eli Apple, formerly of the New York Giants, now on the Saints. When Eli Apple was getting drafted, his mother went on the NFL Network many times, not only to promote her son, but also boast about herself. This kind of relationship between mother and son did not seem right, but of course the Giants drafted him in the first round. Look where he is now, already on his second team! Glad to see Rashan Gary have a strong supporter and good background along with his talent.\nVideo of Rashan Gary and his mother Jennifer:\nVideo of Annie Apple:\n(Embedding disabled for this video - click here)\nFinal Thoughts\nIt was great to be included in this year\u2019s BGN mock draft! I had so much fun and would love to join again next year. Overall, I think Rashan Gary will be a really great draft prospect for any team that takes a chance. The Falcons would be a terrific destination. I think Gary will probably end up somewhere in the top 15, but if he drops below 15, I would not rule out the Eagles making some calls to snatch him up. Sadly, I don\u2019t think Ed Oliver will be falling far either which is said for the Eagles and extremely depressing for the guys at SB Nation\u2019s \u201cThe Falcoholic.\u201d Those guys have an affinity for Oliver and talk about trading up for him many times. Don\u2019t be surprised if the Falcons get Oliver or Gary. That would make for a beastly D-Line. Watch out for the Falcons next year, that is until they play the Eagles(Matt Ryan sucks vs Eagles). The draft is right around the corner! Can\u2019t wait! Thanks to BLG and the other dedicated BGN members that will help occupy my time leading up to the draft and the start the regular season with nonstop awesome coverage! Both Birds(Eagles and Falcons) are in store for a great year this year and possibly another playoff matchup! Until the Draft, happy mock drafting and enjoy the rest of the BGN mock draft. Thanks for surviving the long reading everyone! I\u2019ll leave you with the best fun fact out there:\nTHE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES ARE THE LAST TEAM TO SCORE A TOUCHDOWN IN A SUPER BOWL!\nP.S. In honor of the Washington Team being next on the clock, take a moment to be thankful for the current NFC East General Managers. They all should get raises and extensions!

            "It was never a secret that American Horror Story: Apocalypse would be a crossover of Murder House and Coven, but some fans were shocked when Hotel was also included.\nQueenie (Gabourey Sidibe), a witch from Coven, was killed during the Hotel season when she checks into the Cortez. She is attacked by Ramona Royale (Angela Bassett) and finished off by James March (Evan Peters). Even though she has powers, they are unless on ghosts, which is why March is able to kill Queenie. Most were confidant Queenie's death was final, but Episode 4 of Apocalypse showed more of Queenie's backstory.\nCordelia Foxx (Sarah Paulson) reveals she tried to break Queenie out of the Hotel Cortez. After all, people can check in but they can never leave. No matter what Cordelia tried to do, she was unable to remove Queenie from the hotel.\n\"I went immediately to bring her back from the monstrous place and I had no illusions that it would be easy. The Cortez is a place of evil, a hell mouth,\" Cordelia explains to the counsel of warlocks.\n\"I could hear the souls screaming in the walls desperate for a way out. I realized the hotel wasn't merely haunted,\" she adds.\nCordelia tried everything she could. \"We went through every door and every window but we couldn't' escape the hotel. All my spells and incantations were useless in that realm,\" she says. The witches need light for their powers, but in the Hotel Cortez they were \"extinguished by Satan himself,\" she says.\n\"My effort to rescue Queenie is by far my greatest failure as supreme but I tried and I do care about all of our people,\" Cordelia confesses. \"All of our people.\"\nCordelia closes the counsel, even after she's accused of being a bigot and not wanting a male supreme.\nWhile Cordelia wasn't able to free Queenie, someone else was.\nMichael Langdon (Cody Fern), who might potentially be a warlock, visits the hotel. March is impressed with Langdon, saying even though he's alive he has a special connection with the dead. Langdon tells Queenie he must leave with her, though she isn't exactly thrilled to go. March reveals she doesn't really have a choice and she takes Langdon's hand. She doesn't plan to be gone long, telling March she'll be back.\nAfter visiting Madison Montgomery (Emma Roberts) in her personal hell, Langdon returns with both Madison and Queenie.\nCordelia, who had been fighting with warlocks about Langdon potentially being the supreme, is shocked when she sees Queenie and Madison with him and faints.\nAmerican Horror Story: Apocalypse airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. ET on FX."

            "TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada\u2019s upper house of parliament on Tuesday approved a revised bill to legalize recreational marijuana, setting the stage for the country to become the first Group of Seven nation to legalize cannabis.\nThe Senate voted 52-29 in favor of the revised bill from the elected House of Commons, paving the way for a fully legal cannabis market within eight to 12 weeks.\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals had made legalizing recreational use of marijuana part of their successful 2015 election campaign, arguing the new law would keep pot out of the hands of underage users and reduce related crime.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been too easy for our kids to get marijuana - and for criminals to reap the profits. Today, we change that. Our plan to legalize & regulate marijuana just passed the Senate,\u201d Trudeau said in a tweet.\nAs the first major economy to fully legalize cannabis, Canada\u2019s regulatory rollout will be closely watched by other nations considering the same path - and by global investors, who have already poured billions into Canadian marijuana firms.\nCanadian marijuana companies like Canopy Growth Corp, Aphria Inc, Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF and Aurora Cannabis Inc have been at the center of investor frenzy surrounding attempts to legalize marijuana for recreational use nationwide.\nLegalization has already been delayed from the government\u2019s initially planned July launch.\nWhile production of cannabis is regulated by the federal government, provinces and cities have more powers over retail sales either through private or government-owned stores.\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling just great,\u201d CBC News quoted Tony Dean, who sponsored the bill in the Senate, as saying. \u201cThe end of 90 years of prohibition.

            "A migrant child died shortly after being released from a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Texas, according to a Washington D.C.-based attorney group.\nThe American Immigration Lawyers Association said Wednesday it had learned of the death of the toddler shortly after the unidentified child and a parent left the ICE family detention center in Dilley, The Associated Press reported.\n\u201cAILA has learned that a toddler died soon after release from the Dilley South Texas Family Residential Center,\u201d Gregory Z. Chen, director of government relations for the 15,000-member association, said in a statement to The Washington Post. \u201cWe do not have information on the cause of death or information that confirms a connection between medical treatment at STFRC and this death.\u201d\nSomeone in contact with the family made the legal group aware of the child's death, AILA said. They did not name the child or reveal when the alleged death occurred.\nA spokeswoman for ICE told The AP it would investigate the report, but could not provide any information without specifics about the child in question. ICE denied that a child had died at the detention center.\nWord that a child may have died at such a facility spread on social media Tuesday after Washington-based lawyer Melissa Turcios posted on Facebook about the death of a friend's granddaughter.\nShe wrote the child died \u201cas a result of negligent care and a respiratory illness she contracted from one of the other children,\u201d The AP reported.\nTurcios confirmed to the AP that she wrote the post but declined to comment further.\nThe social media post ignited widespread outrage, weeks after the Trump administration ended its zero-tolerance immigration policy that separated parents and children after they illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border. Immigrant advocates have criticized what they point to as inadequate medical care for those detained.\nConditions at the facilities made headlines Tuesday when Matthew Albence, head of enforcement and removal operations for ICE, said during a congressional hearing that conditions at family detention centers was \u201cmore like a summer camp\u201d than a jail.\n\"These individuals have access to 24/7 food and water,\" he said. \"They have educational opportunities. They have recreational opportunities, both structured as well as unstructured. There's basketball courts, there's exercise classes, there's soccer fields that we put in there.\n\"They have extensive medical, dental and mental health opportunities,\" Albence continued. \"In fact, many of these individuals, the first time they've ever seen a dentist, is when they've come to one of our centers.\"\nRELATED STORIES"

            "HOLLYWOOD\u2014Can you believe it after waiting what seemed like years, \u201cThe Young and the Restless\u201d have finally brought Adam Newman back to the foray. I will admit Michael Munhey made the character iconic, and Justin Hartley came on board and made the character his own. That is very difficult to do in the soap arena and a rare accomplishment to say the least. Rather Mark Grossman can fill the shoes previously held by Munhey and Hartley only time will tell, but it looks like \u201cY&R\u201d is finally looking to bring back a worthy villain to the soap world.\nSo at last, the audience finally knows exactly what Victor has been up to with all those secret trips to Las Vegas. At first I thought it would be Victoria who would discover what dear ole dad was up to, but nope, it\u2019s the one woman who I secretly think has always held a special place in Adam\u2019s heart. That person is Sharon. Yes, Rey was hired by Nikki to find out exactly what her hubby was up to. Rey confronted a psychiatrist that Victor had apparently hired. As Rey and Sharon dug, Victor was forced to spill the truth to Sharon.\nYes, he admitted that Adam Newman is very much alive and did not die in that cabin explosion. Sharon was flabbergasted by the revelation. Not just because Adam was alive, but Victor wanted her to travel back down a slippery slope to help Adam. Hmm, I see where this is headed, another complicated love triangle just when Sharon was in a happy place with Rey, her former lover Adam returns from the grave. Sharon is afraid to go down that rabbit hole, and once Rey learned all the mayhem Adam put Sharon thru, he should be worried if he regains his memory.\nYes, Adam has amnesia and cannot remember anything before the explosion. So typical in the soap world America, but I sense Adam\u2019s return is about to deliver some juicy stories in the coming weeks. Why? Melissa Claire Egan is slated to reprise her role as Chelsea Newman. Remember last time we say Chelsea she was on the run with Connor after being exposed by Phyllis of all people. This should be epic fun because it will give Nick something to do, not to mention it changes everything for Nick with Christian. Remember Christian is Adam\u2019s son, not Nick\u2019s, and Adam never came face-to-face with his child with Sage.\nOh, this is perfect timing to see some iconic characters return to \u201cY&R\u201d to infuse a bit of drama to the soap, which has been lackluster a bit lately. Kyle and Lola finally consummated their relationship, which has scorned Summer to a degree. I mean they\u2019re married, and they have to work together, and it\u2019s causing all types of friction at Jabot. It was just a matter of time before Summer\u2019s antics came back to haunt her, but we also know how devious Summer can be when she wants something. Remember her seduction of Billy?\nIn other relationship news in the Rosales family, it seems Mia and Arturo just can\u2019t keep their hands off one another. They sunk their relationships and there isn\u2019t much they can do to change the outcome at this point, but Paul cuffed Mia as the clues about her role in Lola\u2019s attack came to light. And perhaps in one of the most out of left-field moves, I sense the writers might be pairing Cane and Traci? It feels that way, but I cannot be 100 percent certain. Also it is fun to finally see Devon move on after Hilary with Elena of all people, someone who has suffered an immense loss in her lifetime as well.\nSo Adam Newman is about to be the catalyst for the return of some major \u201cY&R\u201d characters, I\u2019m sensing November sweeps will be epic compared to May sweeps."

            "Congress leaders Jyotiraditya Scindia, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Raj Babbar pay tribute to CRPF personnel who were killed in in a terror attack in Kashmir, in Lucknow on Thursday. (Express Photo: Vishal Srivastav)\nPriyanka Gandhi Vadra Thursday called off her first press conference after being inducted in the Congress as a general secretary, expressing grief over the deaths of 37 CRPF personnel in a terror attack in Kashmir.\nThe press conference was meant to wrap up her four-day visit to the state, the first after being appointed in charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.\n\u201cYeh karikaram rajnaitik charcha ke liye rakha gaya tha, lekin Pulwama mein jo atanki hamla hua hai, jiski wajah se hum yeh anuchit samjhte hain ki hum yeh rajnaitik charcha karen (This conference was organised for political discussions, but following the terrorist attack in Pulwama, I find it inappropriate to indulge in the same),\u201d Priyanka told reporters. A two-minute silence was also observed as a mark of grief.\nPriyanka appeared before the mediapersons with sitting BJP MLA from Meerapur constituency in Muzaffarnagar Avtar Singh Bhadana and former Union Minister Ram Lal Rahi who joined Congress on Thursday. She said that both had come to join Congress, but she has decided to stay away from any political discussion because of the terror attack.\n\u201cI want to tell their families that every single countryman is with them in their hour of grief,\u201d she said. \u201cThey should have faith\u2026 we are standing by them,\u201d she added.\nBhadana joined the Congress a day after Priyanka announced alliance with Mahan Dal, a little known outfit in Western Uttar Pradesh, which has a base among a section of the \u201cnon-Yadavs\u201d. Bhadana, a \u201cGujjar\u201d, had joined Rashtriya Lok Dal in 2015 and then BJP before 2017 Lok Sabha elections. He also won from Meerapur Assembly constituency. His induction would help Congress further strengthen its base in Western Uttar Pradesh, as most of its prominent leaders are either in Central or Eastern Uttar Pradesh.\nFormer Union Minister and four-time MP from Mishrikh Lok Sabha constituency in Sitapur, Ram Lal Rahi, was expelled from Congress four years back for participating in Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Swachch Bharat Abiyan.\nAdvertisement\nAsked about the joining of Bhadana, BJP spokesperson Harish Srivastava said, \u201cAise log na ghar ke rehte hain na ghat ke. (Such people belong no where).\u201d As for Rahi, he said that while Rahi\u2019s son Suresh Rahi is a BJP MLA from Hargaon, his father is not with the saffron party.\nOn Thursday, Priyanka met leaders and workers from 11 Lok Sabha constituencies, including Varanasi, the seat won with a thumping majority by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014.\nShe also held meetings with party workers from Etawah and Farrukhabad, state\u2019s Congress spokesperson Ashok Singh said.\nAdvertisement\nJyotiraditya Scindia, the AICC general secretary for western UP, also held discussions with workers from constituencies under his charge.\n(With PTI)"

The Indian captain Virat Kohli has made a comeback and will lead the side for the first time in ODI cricket after the series in England. Rishabh Pant has been picked up for the first time in the ODI team but MS Dhoni will be the man behind the wickets.\nDinesh Karthik has been left out of the squad. Kedar Jadhav who was crucial for India during the Asia Cup will not be a part of the side after injuring his hamstring again during the final of Asia cup. Bhuvaneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah have been rested for the first two one-dayers again and the young Khaleel Ahmed will again get a chance to prove himself in the first two games if he is given an opportunity.\nRohit Sharma will return to his role of vice-captain after having a successful run as the captain of the Indian team during the Asia Cup. It will be interesting to see if KL Rahul is given a chance to open the innings as both Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan have been the pillars of the top order in the limited overs format.\nRavindra Jadeja has also retained his spot after a good outing during the Asia cup.\nHere is the full squad: Virat Kohli (Capt), Rohit Sharma (VC), Shikhar Dhawan, Ambati Rayudu, Manish Pandey, MS Dhoni (wk), Rishabh Pant, R Jadeja, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Shami, Khaleel Ahmed, Shardul Thakur, KL Rahul."

And in case you were concerned the budget carrier's ticket prices to the Pacific archipelago wouldn't be as low as you'd hoped, worry not. When tickets first went on sale upon the announcement, you could nab a round-trip ticket there from Oakland for under $100, but as you might guess, these prices are sure to sell out quickly (if they haven\u2019t already). Southwest said the insanely low fares are an introductory deal that ends on Tuesday, with regular fares to follow.\nYou can scope out the full lineup of new Hawaii flights on the airline's just-launched Hawaii ticket portal.

            "Tui grabs at a fan after being abused following the loss to the Wallabies.\nTHE relentless abuse from a Wallabies fan to Lukhan Tui which ended in an ugly altercation in the stands following the 23-19 loss to Argentina on the Gold Coast has been revealed.\nBroadcast footage showed the man hurling abuse at players before the push-and- shove with Tui unfolded.\nOther players, injured Wallabies centre Samu Kerevi and team staffers moved in to try and defuse the situation.\nThe fan was later led away from the area by his throat by another spectator and was detained by Rugby Australia security guards, along with a second offending fan.\nFoxsports.com.au understands that the fan is unlikely to reveieve a ban, while Rugby Australia is currently reviewing their risk management policy.\nFairfax today revealed the sledge that caused Tui, playing days after the death of his stepfather, to react in anger.\n\u201cYou\u2019re all f---ing useless,\u2019\u2019 the fan yelled.\n\u2018\u2018F----ing disgraceful. Why don\u2019t you play with some heart? You should all be f---ing ashamed.\u201d\nWallabies coach Michael Cheika told the media he didn\u2019t expect Lukhan Tui will join the team for their Rugby Championship tour after indicating his desire to sit out the remainder of the season.\nA distraught Tui told teammates he needed to take a break from rugby after his altercation with a spectator who had allegedly pushed his sister moments after Saturday night\u2019s 23-19 defeat to Argentina.\nIt was an ugly end to an already emotional week for Tui\u2019s family - his stepfather died suddenly on Wednesday and the Wallabies wore black armbands in his honour during the game on the Gold Coast.\nTui was still able to take his place in the starting team and played the full 80 minutes at blindside flanker.\nBut Cheika said the 21-year-old addressed the playing group after the match, telling them he needed to take time away from rugby and would cut his 2018 campaign short.\nThat means sitting out trips to South Africa and Argentina later this month - two hugely important clashes for a Wallabies team in the thick of a horrendous patch of form.\nCheika is hopeful he can talk Tui around but, as things stand, he doesn\u2019t anticipate he will play in either of those matches.\n\u201cThat remains to be seen. We\u2019ll see how the week pans out and go from there,\u201d he told reporters at Brisbane airport on Sunday.\n\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s unlikely, based on what we spoke about last night.\u201d Cheika said he hadn\u2019t seen or spoken to Tui since the match. \u201cI think it\u2019s very unfortunate, the combination of factors - the game itself, also (Tui\u2019s) situation,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about the fan or what he said or anything.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t like to see that in the game.\n\u201cHis stepfather\u2019s just passed away ... he needs to just be with his family and be together.\u201d Rugby Australia is seeking CCTV vision from inside the stadium and will await reports from venue security before determining what course of action will be taken.\nPolice were on hand and took details but did not arrest either supporter. \u201cI don\u2019t know the details of exactly what happened. As they do in all the grounds in Australia they\u2019ll take a look at it and the people at the ground, they\u2019re responsible for that stuff,\u201d Cheika said."

        "articles": [
            "Princeton economist Alan Krueger died by suicide this past weekend at age 58, the university announced on Monday.\nCasual political observers probably know Krueger best for his four years of service in the Obama administration, first as assistant secretary of the Treasury for economic policy and then as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers \u2014 effectively the White House\u2019s top economist.\nBut to those in his field, Krueger was known for bringing a new level of rigor to economics research and puncturing a number of long-held pieties. His work with Berkeley\u2019s David Card suggested that simplistic econ 101 predictions that minimum wage increases necessarily cause job losses don\u2019t always hold true. His work on education with co-authors like MIT\u2019s Joshua Angrist and Mathematica\u2019s Stacy Dale brought new attention to the ways in which simplistic statistical analyses can lead to wrong conclusions, and popularized new methods for doing that analysis better.\nAnd his work and speeches in the Obama White House helped make economic inequality a mainstream issue of debate in the early 2010s, influencing American political life for years to come.\nHere are four big things that Krueger taught the world.\nMinimum wages don\u2019t always cause job loss\nIn introductory economics courses, students are typically taught that setting price floors \u2014 on milk, oil, or, perhaps most importantly, labor \u2014 causes supply to exceed demand.\nIn the case of labor, what that means is that if there\u2019s a minimum wage, employers\u2019 demand for workers falls (because they cost more), and the supply of workers increases (because they\u2019re promised more money), meaning there\u2019s unemployment, with all the costs and suffering that entails.\nThis conclusion was largely based on abstract theory, but it held sway for decades. This chart, from economist Lars Christensen, lays out this econ 101-type analysis as it applies to the minimum wage:\nSetting a minimum wage increases wages (Wmin > Weq), sure, but it also increases the supply of labor (N1 > Neq) while decreasing demand (N2 < Neq), and leading to a bunch of unemployment (N1 - N2).\nAs a consequence, for years many economists assumed, almost without questioning, that minimum wages destroyed jobs. They might be worthwhile, sure, but you have to weigh the harm they do to the demand for labor against their benefits for workers who remain employed.\nIn a paper first published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 1993, Krueger and his co-author Card exploded that conventional wisdom. They sought to evaluate the effects of an increase in New Jersey\u2019s minimum wage, from $4.25 to $5.05 an hour, that took effect on April 1, 1992. (At 2019 prices, that\u2019s equivalent to a hike from $7.70 to $9.15.)\nCard and Krueger surveyed more than 400 fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania to see if employment growth was slower in New Jersey following the minimum wage increase. They found no evidence that it was. \u201cDespite the increase in wages, full-time-equivalent employment increased in New Jersey relative to Pennsylvania,\u201d they concluded. That increase wasn\u2019t statistically significant, but they certainly found no reason to think that the minimum wage was hurting job growth in New Jersey relative to Pennsylvania.\nCard and Krueger\u2019s was not the first paper to estimate the empirical effects of the minimum wage. But its compelling methodology, and the fact that it came from two highly respected professors at Princeton, forced orthodox economists to take the conclusion seriously. New York Times reporter Binyamin Appelbaum lays out some of the vitriolic reaction to the paper in a Twitter thread:\nThe Nobel laureate James Buchanan wrote in the Wall Street Journal that Card and Krueger were undermining the credibility of economics as a discipline. He called them and their allies \"a bevy of camp-following whores.\" \u2014 Binyamin Appelbaum (@BCAppelbaum) March 18, 2019\nCard and Krueger expanded their results into a well-regarded book, Myth and Measurement, and then largely left the debate. \u201cI\u2019ve subsequently stayed away from the minimum wage literature for a number of reasons,\u201d Card said in an interview years later. \u201cFirst, it cost me a lot of friends. People that I had known for many years, for instance, some of the ones I met at my first job at the University of Chicago, became very angry or disappointed. They thought that in publishing our work we were being traitors to the cause of economics as a whole.\u201d\nBut the effects of their research have remained. Both critics and supporters of minimum wage increases have gotten a lot less theoretical and a lot more empirical. Some empirical economists (most notably UC Irvine\u2019s David Neumark) still think minimum wages cause job loss; others (most notably UMass Amherst\u2019s Arindrajit Dube) argue that the employment effects of most hikes in the wage are minimal, and swamped by the reduction in poverty that the increased wage itself generates. But all agree that this is an empirical question best answered through careful consideration of what actually happens.\nThe most recent meta-analysis I\u2019ve seen, reviewing studies published since 2000 (many of which wouldn\u2019t have been written without Card and Krueger), concludes that the effect of most minimum wage increases on employment is small and potentially nonexistent, and that research in the wake of Card and Krueger has substantially lowered the average estimate of minimum wages\u2019 effect on jobs.\nThere are better ways to figure out what causes what\nAlan Krueger \u2014 along with Card and many other prominent microeconomists of their generation \u2014 was part of what their colleagues Joshua Angrist and J\u00f6rn-Steffen Pischke have termed the \u201ccredibility revolution\u201d in economics.\nThey quote in a 2010 paper their older colleague Edward Leamer as stating in 1983, \u201cHardly anyone takes data analysis seriously. Or perhaps more accurately, hardly anyone takes anyone else\u2019s data analysis seriously.\u201d Data analysis was so subjective, so easily pliable to one\u2019s own pre-chosen conclusions, as to feel almost useless.\nThen a new generation of economists took it upon themselves to change that status quo, by carefully adopting better research designs better able to determine causation (not just correlation), and focusing heavily on actual experiments and quasi-experiments where it\u2019s clearer what factor is causing what.\n\u201cInstrumental variables\u201d were one of the more popular tools for sorting out causation to emerge from the credibility revolution, and one of their early test uses was in a paper by Krueger and Angrist on the effects of compulsory schooling (laws requiring people to be in K-12 education until they\u2019re 16 or 17) in the United States, and thus, indirectly on the effects of going to school for longer.\nThe simplest way to see if compulsory schooling increases adult earnings would be to compare if people earned more before or after compulsory schooling took effect in the United States. But there are lots of other factors besides compulsory schooling that affect school attendance and earnings over those periods. Maybe the economy went into recession, or funding for schools also went up, or a lot more schools opened.\nAll those factors would affect earnings and school attendance, and could muddle an analysis trying to sort out what compulsory schooling, specifically, does for students. These other factors are called \u201comitted variables\u201d and can really distort this kind of analysis. You can control for some of them directly, but usually there are omitted variables that you can\u2019t measure or don\u2019t even think of that still matter.\nOne way around this is to find an \u201cinstrumental variable\u201d: a variable that predicts the things whose effects you want to know (compulsory schooling) but that should not separately affect the ultimate effects you\u2019re measuring (earnings).\nAngrist and Krueger used as an instrumental variable the time of year students are born. Whether you\u2019re born in March or November shouldn\u2019t, on its own, affect how much money you make or how many years of school you get. But because compulsory schooling laws typically mandate learning up to a certain age (like 16), they typically result in students with birthdates later in the school year getting more education once they drop out than students with birthdates earlier in the school year.\nSo birthdates allowed Angrist and Krueger to estimate the effects of compulsory schooling (or just going to school longer) without worrying as much about omitted variables. Unless there\u2019s some other way that being born in the first quarter of the school year should lower the earnings of high school dropouts, beyond them being less educated, this method should give a sound estimate of the effects of compulsory schooling itself, and on the effects of having more months of school on earnings.\nTheir conclusion was that school really did boost earnings for students forced to stay in school longer. Their work has been critiqued since, and instrumental variables estimates can mislead if the instrumental variable chosen is badly selected, but the influence of this methodology is hard to overstate.\nThe Angrist-Krueger quarter-of-birth paper stirred a conversation across the discipline about instrumental variables and identification that now underpins modern applied economics\nIt is hard to overstate its influence \u2014 Prof Dynarski (@dynarski) March 18, 2019\nSelective colleges help minority students, but not white students\nKrueger\u2019s work, even when theoretically groundbreaking, tended to be incredibly practical. One great example, especially in light of the recent scandal over bribery in elite college admissions, is his work with Stacy Dale at Mathematica on whether selective colleges actually increase earnings: Does going to Harvard really cause you to earn more than going to UMass Boston?\nHere, again, using proper methods is important. Krueger and Dale found that if you controlled for standard variables like GPAs, SAT scores, and so on, students who went to selective colleges earned substantially more. That might mislead a casual observer into thinking that the selective colleges caused them to earn more, even more than their natural smarts and work ethic would\u2019ve earned them.\nBut Krueger and Dale, in two papers released in NBER in 1999 and 2011, found that selective college attendance actually has no effect if you compare students who were admitted to selective colleges and attended to ones who were admitted and did not attend. These two groups are not identical; presumably there is something different about students who, say, were admitted to Harvard but chose to go to UMass Boston compared to students who were admitted to Harvard and chose to attend. But they\u2019re much more similar groups than Harvard students and UMass Boston students in general. That makes comparing them a better, if still imperfect, way of estimating what going to Harvard does to earnings.\nIn their second paper, Dale and Krueger used a better data set and looked at longer time horizons, and found some interesting nuances. \u201cOur results suggest that students from disadvantaged family backgrounds (in terms of educational attainment) experience a higher return to attending a selective college than those from more advantaged family backgrounds,\u201d they concluded. Black and Hispanic students also tend to benefit economically from going to selective schools. But white kids whose parents went to college and/or grad school don\u2019t benefit much, economically.\nThat\u2019s a good reason for rich white parents like Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin to stop bribing elite colleges to get their kids in; their kids will be fine in material terms regardless. But it\u2019s also a good reason for elite schools to admit a lot more poor, black, and Latino kids, who are likelier to benefit than rich white kids.\nEquality and equality of opportunity are intimately connected\nAs CEA chair for Obama in early 2012, in the wake of Occupy protests and Obama\u2019s \u201cBuffett Rule\u201d proposal to fight inequality, Krueger coined a term that helped solidify the idea that income inequality is a serious harm: the Great Gatsby curve:\nThe curve shows the relationship between income inequality (measured using the Gini coefficient, a standard metric) versus inequality of opportunity (measured by the correlation between a parent\u2019s earnings and their child\u2019s \u2014 the idea being that in a world with equal opportunity, the correlation would be small). And it shows that these two measures usually give very similar answers. That suggests that rising income inequality in the US is likely to be accompanied by a decline in equality of opportunity.\n\u201cThe persistence in the advantages and disadvantages of income passed from parents to the children is predicted to rise by about a quarter for the next generation as a result of the rise in inequality that the U.S. has seen in the last 25 years,\u201d Krueger concluded in his speech. \u201cIt is hard to look at these figures and not be concerned that rising inequality is jeopardizing our tradition of equality of opportunity.\u201d\nThe idea of a connection was not novel to Krueger; Miles Corak, an economist at CUNY, did the research that Krueger based his chart on, and tells some of the backstory here. And naturally, the idea of a correlation has been fiercely contested by conservatives (with others like Corak firing back).\nBut Krueger popularized the relationship and helped make income inequality a more mainstream concern among lawmakers by suggesting that it could be a proxy for the erosion of a value every politician in Washington claims to hold dear: equality of opportunity.\nSign up for the Future Perfect newsletter.

Abhinandan went to school in Bengaluru for a brief while,\" a retired wing commander from ASTE, who is acquainted with Varthaman told TOI.\"He still frequents Bengaluru, although they are settled in Chennai now.

            "Ford has confirmed plans to introduce an all-electric F-150 pickup in a couple of years, and it looks like it will have a little competition when it does. Literally.\nIt\u2019s called the Pickman and the tiny truck only costs $5,700. For good reason.\nIt\u2019s made by China\u2019s Kaiyun Motors and has a 5.5 hp motor that's good for a top speed of just 28 mph, which classifies it as a low-speed or neighborhood electric vehicle (LSV/NEV). Regulations regarding their operation vary state to state, but they are street legal in some places. It's aimed mainly at commercial customers and has a range of 75 miles per charge.\nThe company told Bloomberg that it plans to sell 10,000 Pickmans (Pickmen?) in the U.S. this year, after getting approval to market the vehicle. It\u2019s already sold some under test program it\u2019s been running for the past couple of years and has updated the product to better meet local expectations. One change from the original appears to be a switch from \u201csuicide\u201d style doors to conventional front-hinged ones.\nWhile the $5,700 version is a very basic vehicle, its options list includes features like air conditioning, heated seats and alloy wheels that can bump the price up near $9,000. One could arguably call it a half-ton, however, as the Kaiyun says the rear-wheel-drive vehicle can carry up to 1,100 pounds on its fully-independent suspension.\n(UPDATE: A U.S. based retailer has clarified that the current retail price starts at $8,950 and that options are extra. The $5,700 price cited by Kaiyun does not apply to the NHTSA-approved version, which can be operated on roads with speed limits of 35 mph and under.)\nKaiyun isn't the only foreign automaker looking to make inroads into the U.S. market with a limited use utility vehicle. India's Mahindra has gained a lot of attention for its Roxor off-roader, which looks so much like a WWII Jeep that Jeep is suing the automaker for trademark infringement.\nFULLY-ELECTRIC FORD F-150 IN THE WORKS"

            "One condemned inmate killed another Friday, the first slaying of a death row inmate in California in more than 20 years, officials said.\nJonathan Fajardo, 30, was stabbed in the chest and neck with an inmate-made weapon in a recreational yard of the cell house that holds the bulk of condemned inmates at San Quentin State Prison, said corrections department spokeswoman Terry Thornton.\nLuis Rodriguez, 34, is considered the suspect, she said. Investigators were trying to determine a motive and how he obtained or was able to make the weapon, she said.\nSuch slayings are common in California prisons but rare on death row, where the last one occurred in 1997.\n\"It's very unusual,\" said San Francisco State University associate professor Amy Smith, who studies capital punishment and the psychological impacts of death row. \"It's not supposed to happen, of course.\"\nThere is high security on death row, were every inmate is housed separately but most are allowed to congregate in small groups in the exercise yard where Fajardo was killed, Thornton said.\nAside from the higher security, Smith said that statistically, prisoners serving life sentences and \"folks who are on 'the row' generally have the lowest levels of prison violence, even though it would seem that they might do anything because they have the worst penalty. In fact, they actually have very, very low incidences of violence in prison.\"\nFajardo was awaiting execution on two counts of murder in Los Angeles County in what was considered a hate crime. He also received seven life sentences.\nHe was identified as a Latino gang member who killed a 14-year-old black girl in a racially motivated shooting. He was also condemned for the stabbing death two weeks later of a man who prosecutors said was killed because fellow gang members believed he might be cooperating with police.\nRodriguez is awaiting execution on two counts of murder, also from Los Angeles County. Local media reports identified Rodriguez as a member of another Latino gang convicted of killing two men from a rival gang. He was already suspected of another murder that resulted in a life sentence.\nNo one has been executed in California since 2006, though voters in 2016 passed an initiative that is attempting to speed up capital punishment. Far more condemned inmates on the nation's largest death row have died of natural causes or suicide than have been executed since California reinstated capital punishment in 1978."

            "In case you haven't heard, Amazon Prime Day is quickly approaching. The online sale is set to kick off on July 16 at 3 p.m. ET and it's offering loads of incredible deals. So, for those customers who are looking to up their technology game but can't decide which device to buy, here's what we know about Amazon Echo vs. Amazon Echo Dot.\nAccording to Digital Trends, there's not too many differences between the two smart speakers, but the differences they do have matter. While both of them feature the infamous Amazon-enabled voice assistant, Alexa, they do function differently. The Amazon Echo is great for music fans because of its cylinder speaker, while the Echo Dot caters mainly to voice command. There are a few other differences that might impact that shopping cart. Both items are about the same size in diameter, but the Echo's cylinder shape makes it a lot taller and heavier than the Echo Dot which resembles more of a hockey puck shape. In regards to speaker quality, listeners will get a louder and more defined sounds from the Echo, due to its larger and 360-surround speaker. Plus, obviously, the Echo is going to cost customers a bit more since it sells for $100 as opposed to the Echo Dot's $35 price tag.\nBasically, if you're looking to kick back at your house and chill out with some surround-sound tunes, the Echo might be your best bet. However, if you're wanting to take the speakers on the road with you or just want to order Seamless from your couch without picking up your phone, Echo Dot will definitely suit your needs.\nIs anyone else as excited about Amazon Prime Day as I am? Doubtful, but I'll let you believe so. July 16 will mark the fourth annual cyber sale courtesy of the online retailer, and it's shaping up to be better than ever. Not only has Amazon extended Prime Day to 36 hours, as opposed to its usual 30, but it's also being brought to countries far and wide including the U.K., Spain, Mexico, Japan, India, Italy, Germany, France, China, Canada, Belgium, and Austria.\nSo how can you cop these high technology goodies? First of all, you need to be an Amazon Prime member to take part in the special online holiday. Then, just add the Echo or Echo Dot on your \"watch\" list on Amazon, and wait for that glorious notification that your item has gone on sale. Or, feel free to pop over to Amazon's Prime Day page on their website and click on all the featured sale items.\nIn case you're not totally sold (pun intended) on the Echo or Echo Dot, there's another option that might tickle a customer's fancy. Amazon's Echo Show will also be on sale during Amazon Prime Day for $130, as opposed to its usual $300. With the Echo Show, the classic Alexa-enabled voice will still be present, but what makes this device different from its other Echo siblings is that it features a screen that allows people actually see videos, music lyrics, weather forecasts, to-do lists, and best of all it's completely hands free. To be honest, I think customers should buy all three products. Amazon Prime Day only happens once a year after all.\nShopping in a store might be a nice experience to some people, but for me, there's nothing I love more than filling up a shopping cart in the comfort of my pajamas. Sadly, Amazon Prime Day kicks off on Monday, July 16 in the afternoon, so I guess I'll have to make some orders in the comfort of my work clothes. The online mega sale runs until Wednesday, July 17 at 3 a.m. ET, so mark your calendars, everyone and prepare to shop until you drop.\nWhether you opt for the big and bold Amazon Echo or the daintier Amazon Echo Dot, before you know it they'll be on your doorstep like it's Christmas in July."

            "OTTAWA, Ontario \u2014 The early prognosis doesn\u2019t seem too bad, and Islanders goalie Robin Lehner was declared \u201cday to day\u201d by coach Barry Trotz on Thursday before his team swept a home-and-home with the Senators, taking a 4-2 victory.\nLehner remained back in New York, where he had been bulldozed by Senators forward Brady Tkachuk late in Tuesday\u2019s 5-4 shootout win and had to leave the game with a presumed head injury.\nAlthough Trotz said, \u201cI can\u2019t confirm or deny\u201d that the injury was a concussion, it\u2019s pretty clear Lehner was shaken up on the play. He wasn\u2019t pulled from the game by the league spotter, but rather left the ice after a discussion with the team trainer.\nHe assuredly at least went through the league-mandated concussion protocol.\nForward Matt Martin made the trip and took part in the morning skate, but he missed his fourth straight game with an upper-body injury. He implied after the game that he would be ready to go soon.\nWinger Cal Clutterbuck missed a second straight game with an upper-body injury, and Trotz called him \u201cday-to-day.\u201d\nClutterbuck was hit in the head with a puck while sitting on bench during Sunday\u2019s 4-1 loss to the Flyers, and was not able to return.\nVeteran forward Andrew Ladd was a healthy scratch after he had played four of the previous five games since returning from a long-term injury. Trotz said this was not just part of trying to ease him back into the lineup, but more that he wanted a penalty killer and so he brought Tom Kuhnhackl into the lineup.\n\u201cWithout [Martin] and [Clutterbuck], we needed a penalty killer,\u201d Trotz said. \u201cLadder has done it in the past, but it\u2019s not there yet at this point.\u201d\nAbout midway through the game, Trotz moved rookie defenseman Devon Toews up to the first pair with Johnny Boychuk and moved the struggling Nick Leddy down with Scott Mayfield.\n\u201cNick\u2019s played a lot of hockey,\u201d Trotz said. \u201cLeds and Johnny were having a few rough games here. It hasn\u2019t been really smooth for them. \u2026 So change it up a little bit.\u201d\nWhenever Clutterbuck or Martin are ready to return, one of the Islanders emergency call-ups is going to have to be sent down. It\u2019s likely going to be Josh Ho-Sang, who didn\u2019t play in either game since being called up on Tuesday.\nThe other call-up, Michael Dal Colle, has been impressive while skating on a \u201ckids line\u201d with Mathew Barzal and Anthony Beauvillier.\n\u201cEvery time he\u2019s come up, he\u2019s played really well,\u201d Trotz said. \u201cHe\u2019s pushing some of the veterans to earn their keep.\u201d"

            "Very early in Sekiro, you\u2019ll face your first mini-boss. You\u2019ll find General Naomori Kawarada just past the Ashina Outskirts > Outskirts Wall \u2013 Gate Path Sculptor\u2019s Idol. It\u2019s a tough fight when you\u2019re less than an hour into the game, but it\u2019ll teach you several tactics that you\u2019ll be using throughout the rest of Wolf\u2019s journey.\nApproaching General Naomori Kawarada\nFrom the Outskirts Wall Sculptor\u2019s Idol, grapple to the roof of the gatehouse. If you haven\u2019t yet, make sure you grab the Shuriken Wheel from inside the hallway. Cross the roof heading to the left (away from the Sculptor\u2019s Idol) to the clearing on the far side. Pick up the Pellets, then head along the left side of the arena \u2014 you\u2019ll see General Naomori Kawarada below you.\nKeep moving forward to the gate at the far end of the arena. To avoid getting spotted, stick close the the rock wall and don\u2019t stop moving.\nUse the gatehouse to cut to the right. You\u2019ll end up standing above and behind the general. Lock on to him, then jump off the roof toward him. Hit R1/RB when you see the red glow to execute a Stealth Deathblow. This will cut his health in half before the fight even starts.\nGeneral Naomori Kawarada boss fight\nYou\u2019ve been introduced to the fundamentals of Sekiro, and this fight will cement them in your mind. This is where you\u2019ll put blocking, attacking, and even some new moves into practice, all in the same fight.\nAfter you land your first Deathblow, back away a little and start blocking. Don\u2019t worry too much about Deflects in this fight \u2014 it\u2019s not worth opening yourself up to the chance of missing a block.\nThis fight \u2014 like most fights you\u2019ll have in Sekiro \u2014 starts with your enemy rushing toward you with an attack. What you\u2019re waiting for is his Perilous Attack \u2014 an unblockable, horizontal sweeping swing of his sword. He\u2019ll take a distinctive stance when he\u2019s about to do this and a bright red kanji will appear over Wolf.\nAs soon as you see the symbol, jump and then jump again. This move is called a Jump Kick. It gets you out of the way of the unblockable attack and \u2014 just as importantly \u2014 it deals substantial Posture Damage to the general.\nAfter his sweeping attack, block any other attacks he throws at you. Keep blocking his regular attacks and Jump Kick whenever he sweeps. Again, don\u2019t worry so much about Deflects. The penalty for missing is enormous, and it\u2019s so early in the game that you won\u2019t be great at them. It\u2019s just as easy to beat him without using tons of Deflects.\nHis other Perilous Attack is a grab. You cannot block grabs. If you see him reach back with his left (non-sword) hand and the red kanji appears, dodge or jump away. If you can, follow your dodge with a Dodge Counterattack by hitting the attack button right after (we didn\u2019t pull this off above).\nJust keep blocking, dodging, Jump Kicking, and sneaking in a hit whenever you can. Don\u2019t rush the fight or press the attack if you\u2019re not comfortable. Your goal isn\u2019t necessarily to deal Vitality damage (his health at the top left of the screen). If you can fill his Posture damage bar (the yellow one at the top center of the screen), you\u2019ll get a Deathblow no matter where his Vitality is.\nWhen you fill his Posture Damage about halfway, he\u2019ll back away and strike a pose with a gray mist around him. This completely resets his Posture Damage. If you can rush in close and land a hit or toss a shuriken, you can interrupt him. If you can\u2019t, don\u2019t worry about it and just keep up with the same tactics.\nLand hits whenever you can \u2014 even if he blocks them, you\u2019ll still deal Posture damage. Watch for his Perilous Attacks and Jump Kick to deal even more Posture damage. With some patience, you\u2019ll break his Posture and land your second Deathblow.\nGeneral Naomori Kawarada rewards\nAfter defeating General Naomori Kawarada, you\u2019ll get a Prayer Bead and a Gourd Seed.\nTake the Gourd Seed to Emma at the Dilapidated Temple to increase the number of times you can use your Healing Gourd. (While you\u2019re there, make sure you install the Shuriken Wheel in your Shinobi Prosthetic, if you haven\u2019t already.)\nYou\u2019ll need to collect three more Prayer Beads before you can cash those in at a Sculptor\u2019s Idol to increase your Vitality and Posture."

            "Bengaluru: Karnataka chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Tuesday shifted the responsibility of releasing Tamil actor Rajinikanth\u2019s latest movie, Kaala, on its makers and distributors, asking them not to release the movie in Karnataka, considering the sensitive situation.\nHis statements came even after the Karnataka high court asked the state government to provide security to theatres screening the film. The court heard the case after pro-Kannada groups demanded that the movie not be released in the state over remarks by Rajinikanth about the contentious Cauvery river water sharing issue between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.\nStating that it was the government\u2019s duty to follow the court orders to provide security to centres screening the film, Kumaraswamy said, \u201cin my personal opinion as a Kannadiga, in such situation where there is opposition, it is ideal if they will not release the movie.\"\nKumaraswamy, who hails from the movie industry himself, said that there were many instances of Kannada movies being discriminated in the neighbouring state.\n\u201cAs a government we will take all necessary measures, but if some organisations protest and because of this people don\u2019t turn up, under such circumstances and when they don\u2019t allow our movies to be released, I feel they should not release the movie,\" Kumaraswamy said.\nThe hardened stance of the chief minister comes a day after he met with veteran Tamil actor, Kamal Haasan, who offered to help bridge any differences between the two southern states, including in the Cauvery river water issue.\nThe Cauvery river water issue, that has for generations defined relations between the two states, has taken another turn with the formation of the contentious Cauvery Management Authority (CMA), a body set up to implement the tribunal\u2019s 2007 order on water sharing. This move has been vehemently opposed by Karnataka, one of the two main stakeholders in the dispute.\nKumaraswamy said that the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC) has asked the government not to give permission for the release of the Tamil film.\n\u201cIf they forcefully release the movie they will have to face the consequences. I am not saying this as a chief minister. However, personally, speaking as a Kannadiga, I will say that considering the situation in the state, the makers should themselves not release the movie,\" he said."

The Soldier 76 mask, for instance, might be a great prop to spruce up for more dedicated fans. \u2018\nDisguise is also releasing a line of costumes, including Genji, Soldier: 76, and Tracer. There are a couple of props available for purchase as well: Genji\u2019s Dragonblade and Soldier 76\u2019s heavy pulse rifle.\nHonestly, going to a Halloween party as an Overwatch character seems like a pretty safe bet. Blizzard\u2019s game has thoroughly infiltrated the mainstream, and even if you go to a party without a ton of gamers, someone is going to recognize the characters from social media. As long as someone there has a Tumblr, you should be good.\nThese officially licensed costumes are being released alongside Overwatch\u2019s Halloween Terror event, which starts on October 9th and runs into November."

            "OTTAWA \u2014 A Canadian court on Thursday froze plans to expand an oil pipeline that the government is about to purchase, ruling that the government\u2019s National Energy Board had not adequately consulted with Indigenous people along the pipeline\u2019s route or assessed the project\u2019s potential effects on the waters off British Columbia.\nWhile the practical effect of the decision may be a comparatively short construction delay, the ruling added fuel to an already incendiary debate over the Trans Mountain pipeline that links Alberta\u2019s oil sands to an oil tanker port near Vancouver, British Columbia. The pipeline also branches off to refineries in Washington State.\nAfter the pipeline\u2019s owner, Kinder Morgan of Houston, abandoned its plans to add a second pipeline along the existing Trans Mountain route in April, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government stepped in to buy the 715-mile pipeline for 4.5 billion Canadian dollars, or about $3.4 billion. The sale is expected to be completed soon, possibly this week.\nEnvironmentalists and some Indigenous groups immediately called the ruling a major victory, and some of them urged Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government to give up on plans for the expansion, which has drawn widespread protests driven by environmental concerns."

Haskins is a prototypical pocket passer who diagnoses coverages in an instant. His deep-ball accuracy isn\u2019t ideal and he isn\u2019t very mobile, but Haskins has EVERYTHING else you want in a franchise quarterback\nGRADE: A\nNo. 26: Redskins (from IND): Montez Sweat, Edge Mississippi State\nAnalysis: The Redskins just lost a pass rusher from Mississippi State (Preston Smith) and they replaced him with another one who has an even higher ceiling. Montez Sweat ran a faster 40 than Odell Beckham! He dropped after being misdiagnosed with a heart issue at the combine, so Washington is getting a top-15 talent here after getting a top-10 talent in Dwayne Haskins. The Redskins are killing the draft, and I have no idea what\u2019s real anymore.\nGrade: A-\n76. Redskins: Terry McLaurin, WR Ohio State\nAnalysis: Terry McLaurin is a professional route-runner who flashed during Senior Bowl practices. He\u2019s got long speed, but he\u2019s not great in contested catch scenarios. The Redskins likely see him as a replacement for Jamison Crowder.\nGRADE: B+\nRead all our grades for the first round of the NFL Draft."

            "Watching Game of Thrones\u2019 final season in Canada is now a relatively simple process.\nIn years past, Canadians either needed to download the show though illegal torrents, find a way to subscribe to U.S.-only streaming app HBO Now, or have a traditional HBO cable subscription, which also granted access to the now dead TMN Go streaming app.\nNow, in order to watch Game of Thrones in Canada, all you need is a subscription to Bell\u2019s Crave streaming service. Back in November Bell rebranded Crave TV to Crave. Along with the name change, the company also revamped the platform\u2019s user interface and launched a $9.99 subscription tier that adds current HBO content to the platform.\nSubscribing to the $9.99 base level tier and then adding the additional $9.99 \u2018Movies + HBO\u2019 tier gives you access to live and currently airing HBO content like Game of Thrones Season 8. This brings the total monthly subscription cost to $19.98.\nTo subscribe, navigate to Crave.ca and click on \u2018Sign In.\u2019 Next, click \u2018Subscribe now!\u2018 and type your email address and create a password. You\u2019ll then be given two subscription options, either $9.99 monthly or $99.90 a year. The next screen allows you to add Movies + HBO for an additional $9.99 a month, as well as Starz content for $5.99 per month.\nMovies + HBO subscriptions cost $9.99 per month or $99.90 annually. Starz, which isn\u2019t necessary to watch Game of Thrones, can be subscribed to for $5.99 per month or $59.90 annually.\nOnce you\u2019ve moved through these steps, you\u2019ll be able to watch Game of Thrones Season 8.\nBell says that new episodes of Game of Thrones will stream at 9pm ET/6pm PT every Sunday as the same time as the show airs on HBO\u2019s cable channel. You can also watch every new episode of season 8 live if you navigate to the \u2018On Air\u2019 area of the HBO section in the Crave app.\nCrave is available on iOS, Android, desktop and Xbox One. A PlayStation 4 Crave app is not yet available, though Bell has repeatedly stated it plans to bring the streaming service to the platform in the future.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Crave now streams in 1080p on iOS, Android and Xbox One. Previously stream quality was locked to 720p for most content, with Apple\u2019s 4th-generation Apple TV being the only device to support 1080p."

It was a scurrilous piece of play-acting from the cheeky Senegalese.\n19 Jun 2018 17.47 BST GOAL! Poland 1-2 Senegal (Krychowiak ) Krychowiak scores with a header from a free-kick, but his effort is being referred to the VAR officials. It stands! Krychowiak gets one back for Poland.

Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images\nUpdated at 17.53 BST\n19 Jun 2018 17.46 BST 81 min: Sarr goes down \u201cinjured\u201d and the referee tells him to get up. Seconds later, he\u2019s managed to shake whatever was ailing him and picks up a pass and sprints into the Poland penalty area from the right flank. Rybus dives in to ... oh, hold on.\n19 Jun 2018 17.44 BST 80 min: Poland\u2019s reaction to going two down has been ... to do nothing. They\u2019re plugging away with the same tactics that have served them so poorly for 80 minutes. \u201cWhen things aren\u2019t working you have to try to do something to change them,\u201d says Ally McCoist. \u201cJust go long for a few minutes, play it forward to Lewandowski. Just do something different.\u201d\n19 Jun 2018 17.39 BST 74 min: Looking at a replay of Senegal\u2019s second goal ... crikey, what a meltdown. From inside the Senegal half, on the edge of the centre-circle, Krychowiak hoisted a huge back-pass towards Wojciech Szczesney. Having just been waved back on to the pitch, Niang saw what was happening and sprinted towards the Poland penalty area. With Bednarek just sort of standing a couple of yards outside it waiting for Szczesny to claim the ball after haring out of his area, Niang darted between both Poles, flicked the ball goalwards and had the relatively straight forward task of advancing a few yards and scoring into an empty net while Szczesny and Bednarek stood glaring at each other and Krychowiak.\nUpdated at 18.12 BST\n19 Jun 2018 17.33 BST 72 min: Gueye is booked for a foul on Robert Lewandowski. Senegal substitution from just after they scored their second goal: Mama Biram Diouf off, Birmingham City\u2019s Cheick Ndoye on.\n19 Jun 2018 17.31 BST 69 min: Piszczek drills a low cross to the near post, where Milik had found a pocket of space courtesy of a good run. He\u2019s first to the ball but shoots the wrong side of the upright from four or five yards.\n19 Jun 2018 17.30 BST 65 min: Poland\u2019s players were complaining in the wake of that goal and I think it\u2019s because Niang had left the field after suffering an injury and they believe he had either returned without the referee\u2019s permission or come on in an advantageous position to make the most of Krychowiak\u2019s tomfoolery. It seems the ref had waved him back on and after that it was just tough luck on Poland, who only have themselves to blame for that defensive calamity.\n19 Jun 2018 17.25 BST 62 min: Awful stuff from Poland. From the centre of the pitch and for reasons best known to himself, Krychowiak tries to loft a 50 yard pass back to his own goalkeeper. His pass drops woefully short and with Niang and Szczesny both charging at the ball from opposite directions, the Senegal wins it and has the straightforward task of shooting into an empty net. Bednarek could have done better too, but looked powerless to stop Niang as he raced Szczesny to the ball.\n19 Jun 2018 17.21 BST GOAL! Poland 0-2 Senegal (Niang 60) A hideous mistake by Krychowiack gifts Senegal a second goal. Niang beats Szczesny to the ball to score Senegal\u2019s second. Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters celebration pile up. Photograph: Catherine Ivill/Getty Images\nUpdated at 17.29 BST\n19 Jun 2018 17.20 BST 58 min: \u201cEverything looks a struggle! Everything looks a struggle!\u201d says Ally McCoist to Jon Champion on the UK coverage of this game, upon asked for his thoughts on how Poland are doing. The pair make for a very entertaining duo and have just been laughing at their discovery that former Senegal, Liverpool, Bolton and Rangers player El-Hadji Diouf now works in Dakar as a government goodwill ambassador. \u201cThere\u2019s hope for us all,\u201d chuckles Ally.\n19 Jun 2018 17.17 BST 56 min: Poland are playing with a bit more urgency in this second half, but have yet to create a chance of note from open play. They do so as I type - with Rybus sending an inviting cross to the back post, where it drops invitingly for Lukasz Piszczek. He sidefoots an atrocious volley well wide of the upright.\n19 Jun 2018 17.15 BST 54 min: Lewandowski is penalised for a foul on Ismaila Sarr as the pair tussle for the ball down by the byline to the right of the Senegal goal.\n19 Jun 2018 17.12 BST 50 min: SAVED!!! Lewandowski takes the free-kick and it\u2019s a good one \u2013 on target, but lacking that bit of zip which might have taken it past Khadim N\u2019Diaye in the Senegal goal. Lewandowski takes the free-kick. Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA\nUpdated at 17.41 BST\n19 Jun 2018 17.10 BST 49 min: Lewandowski wins the ball on the halfway line and gallops forward. He\u2019s brought down illegally by Salif Sane on the edge of the Senegal penalty area and the Senegal centre-back gets a yellow card. Free-kick for Poland, a yard or two from the D on the Senegal penalty area. Lewandowski goes down after the challenge from Sane. Photograph: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images\nUpdated at 17.16 BST\n19 Jun 2018 17.09 BST 46 min: Jan Bednarek, who plays for Southampton, looks badly hurt after his collision with Youssouf-Sabaly but is up and looking alert after receiving treatment. He\u2019s on for Kuba Blaszczykowski, which is good news for those of us who type minute-by-minute reports for a living.\n19 Jun 2018 17.07 BST Second half: Poland 0-1 Senegal 46 min: This match seems to be getting a bad press on Twitter, which is obviously the most accurate barometer of informed public opinion we have, but I\u2019ve found it quite entertaining so far. Sadio Mane has been fairly quiet, as has Poland\u2019s most creative player, Piotr Zielinski. Robert Lewandowski had little or no service in that first half. Play resumes, with Bednarek on for Poland. He\u2019s immediately clattered in an accidental collision.\n19 Jun 2018 16.52 BST Half-time: Poland 0-1 Senegal Peeep! The players troop off for their half-time cuppa, with Senegal leading by the only goal of the game. It\u2019s been entertaining enough, but far from a classic. Thiago Cionek\u2019s own-goal separates the sides; the Polish central defender was helpless to do much about it after Idrissa Gueye\u2019s low drive went in off his shin after 37 minutes.\n19 Jun 2018 16.50 BST 45 min: We\u2019re into added time at the end of the first half. There\u2019s a touch of England-against-Tunisia about Poland\u2019s performance - they\u2019re looking toothless up front and lacking that little bit of creative flair in midfield that might cause Senegal problems.\n19 Jun 2018 16.47 BST 44 min: The clock ticks towards half-time with Senegal continuing to dominate. Krychowiak is penalised for a foul ion Idrissa Gueye about 10 yards inside the Poland half. He\u2019s already on a yellow card and can count himself extremely lucky not to have got a second one for that late tackle.\n19 Jun 2018 16.45 BST 41 min: Senegal corner. The ball\u2019s floated into the mixer and burley Senegal centre-back defender Salif Sane leaps highest. He doesn\u2019t make decent contact with the ball and admonishes himself in the strongest possible terms after heading the ball straight into the ground. He should have scored there.\n19 Jun 2018 16.44 BST 40 min: Fifa\u2019s boffins have decreed that Gueye\u2019s shot was going narrowly wide before it was deflected, so Senegal\u2019s opener will officially go down as a Thiago Cionek own-goal.\n19 Jun 2018 16.42 BST 38 min: Dearie me, how\u2019s your luck? Senegal take the lead through a deflected goal. Mane squared the ball for Idrissa Gueye several yards outside the penalty area and the Everton man took a shot. His low drive took a deflection off Cionek and went into the bottom right-hand corner with goalkeeper Szczesny hopelessly wrong-footed.\nUpdated at 17.01 BST\n19 Jun 2018 16.40 BST GOAL!

Both sides look fairly evenly matched, but good chances have been conspicuous by their absence. On the UK Coverage, Allly McCoist is on co-comms duty and is currently bemoaning the lack of movement from the attacking players of both sides. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re showing each other a bit too much respect,\u201d he muses, as he points to the reluctance of the full-backs of both sides to get forward.\n19 Jun 2018 16.28 BST 25 min: Senegal go on the attack again, a series of slick passes coming to an end when Mama Biram Diouf is unable to control a clever Niang pass into the penalty area.\n19 Jun 2018 16.26 BST 23 min: Kuba takes a poor first touch on the edge of the Senegal penalty area and goes down looking for a free-kick. The ball breaks to Lewandowski, with his back to goal. He swivels and shoots, but doesn\u2019t get hold of the ball properly. Wide. Lewandowski shoots wide.

            "Reviews are trickling in for \u201cJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,\u201d and the fifth \u201cJurassic\u201d installment seems to have left critics mostly satisfied, though still yearning for a little more from yet another dinosaur-filled action-adventure ride. \u201cFallen Kingdom\u201d currently sits at a 69% on Rotten Tomatoes, a dip from its 2015 predecessor, \u201cJurassic World,\u201d which finished at a 71%.\n\u201cFallen Kingdom\u201d star Chris Pratt comes in hot after his appearance as Star-Lord in \u201cAvengers: Infinity War.\u201d Directed by \u201cA Monster Calls\u201d helmer J.A. Bayona, the movie was written by \u201cJurassic World\u201d director Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly.\nVariety\u2019s own Owen Gleiberman said the film reminded him more of 1970s disaster movie than a dinosaur picture, but praised Pratt\u2019s performance, noting he \u201cexudes a lean-and-mean sincerity.\u201d\n\u201cJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\u201d hits theaters on June 22. Read below to see what critics think about the franchise\u2019s newest reptile ride.\nVariety\u2019s Owen Glieberman:\n\u201cThe first \u2018Jurassic World\u2019 was, quite simply, not a good ride. \u2018Fallen Kingdom\u2019 is an improvement, but it\u2019s the first \u2018Jurassic\u2019 film to come close to pretending that it isn\u2019t a ride at all, and as a result it ends up being just a so-so ride. I hope the next one is an all-out ride \u2014 but that for the first time since Spielberg\u2019s 1993 original, it\u2019s actually a great one. The audience for this series has proved that it will turn out in mega-droves. But it deserves more than a passable rerun taking itself too seriously.\u201d\nNew York Post\u2019s Johnny Oleksinski:\n\u201c\u2018Fallen Kingdom\u2019 is a more interesting, and less obvious, story than the usual Tyrannosaurus romps, which tend to be death-defying games of hide-and-seek. But you can hear the eye rolls during an 11th-hour twist involving the benevolent billionaire\u2019s granddaughter, which is way too philosophical for a film where dudes\u2019 heads are bitten off by lizards. Jeff Goldblum, making a cameo appearance as Dr. Ian Malcolm, provides all the high-mindedness we need as he natters on about chaos theory in an early monologue.\u201d\nIGN\u2019s Gav Murphy:\n\u201cJ.A. Bayona feels like the perfect director to take control of \u2018Fallen Kingdom\u2019 after proving he can handle large-scale destruction with confidence but is equally capable of delivering intimate scares. There are echoes of his previous works such as The Impossible (big old natural disaster) and The Orphanage (creepy old secret-filled house) in \u2018Fallen Kingdom\u2019 but more impressive is how it draws on further inspirations like Alfred Hitchcock and Hammer horror style suspense. The latter is definitely felt throughout the film and Bayona\u2019s use of light and shadows to create tension is one of the highlights of \u2018Fallen Kingdom.\u2019 Whether it\u2019s a toothy Baryonyx stalking through a tunnel lit by a menacing drop of lava or the claws of the terrifying new Indoraptor illuminated by a child\u2019s night-light, Bayona\u2019s horror seems classy and rarely resorts to simply jump scares.\u201d\nIndieWire\u2019s Eric Kohn:\n\u201cIn the wake of the box-office lunacy that drove \u2018Jurassic World\u2019 to become the fifth-highest grossing movie of all time, \u2018Fallen Kingdom\u2019 is a frustrating display of overconfidence. It\u2019s occasionally elevated by director J.A. Bayona\u2019s penchant for taut human-versus-dino showdowns, but fleeting moments of inspired filmmaking can\u2019t overshadow the broader tendency of this material to sag into stupidity. Campy dialogue and ludicrous plot twists abound: The fate of these resurrected creatures remains uncertain, but the formula for their movies will never go extinct.\u201d\nThe Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw:\n\u201cThere are some reasonably entertaining scenes and set pieces, but the whole concept feels tired and contrived, and crucially the dinosaurs themselves are starting to look samey, without inspiring much of the awe or terror they used to. It could be that a meteor of tedium is heading towards these CGI creatures, despatching them to extinction.\u201d\ni09\u2019s Germain Lussier:\n\u201cNone of the characters really stand out, either. Claire and Owen basically just become slightly more self-aware versions of themselves. Mills is never an intimidating villain. Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum returning to his classic role) is criminally underused. Lockwood\u2019s importance to the franchise feels incredibly forced and, as a result, much of the logic behind the franchise gets undercut and subverted. A few things happen toward the end of \u2018Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\u2019 that are likely to induce groans more than cheers.\u201d\nVanity Fair\u2019s Richard Lawson:\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m all that eager to see what becomes of our prehistoric pals next, but at least their latest adventure gives them proper consideration. There\u2019s a scene in \u2018Fallen Kingdom\u2019 that will stay with me for a little while: a lone brontosaurus, standing on a shore nearly engulfed in ash and flame, stretching its long neck up to the sky and braying out a mournful plaint. In the context of the film, it\u2019s supposed to be saying, \u2018Come back, save me.\u2019 But I don\u2019t know; I think it\u2019s possible that, having had enough, this behemoth is actually saying goodbye. Watching it grandly fade into nothing, I found myself wishing that, for once, someone would honor its wishes.\u201d\nAV Club\u2019s Jesse Hassenger:\n\u201cThese movies often literally retread the same ground as their predecessors, encountering layers of detritus from those other movies in the process. (The original \u2018Jurassic Park\u2019 cars are briefly rediscovered here, just as they were last time around.) The thematic work of \u2018Fallen Kingdom\u2019 is scribbly and half-finished, a series of dopey riffs on what came before about humans living with the consequences of their scientific meddling. But as a lava-spewing, raptor-training, teeth-gnashing, monster-in-the-basement creature feature, it has a certain freshness.\u201d\nEntertainment Weekly\u2019s Chris Nashawaty:\n\u201cNeedless to say, idealism butts heads with greed, children will be put in peril, doublecrosses will be doublecrossed, and a menagerie of various CG raptors and rexes will pop up to serve well-timed scares to younger moviegoers, including a bit of run-amok mayhem off of the island that\u2019s like a haunted house version of The Lost World\u2018s San Diego sequence. Howard, thankfully, gets more to do than the last go round (and in combat boots, no less!), Pratt busts out his signature Indiana Jones cocktail of can-do heroism and deadpan sarcasm, and Bayona and his screenwriters (Trevorrow and Derek Connolly) test the laws of incredulity with varying degrees of success. At least, until the final half hour when forehead-slapping hooey finally win out. Up until then, \u2018Fallen Kingdom\u2019 is exactly the kind of escapist summer behemoth you want it to be.\u201d\nCinemaBlend\u2019s Mike Reyes:\n\u201c\u2018Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\u2019 is a high-class summer blockbuster, with some unexpected emotions, a heap of the action that one would expect from such a film, and a dash of surprisingly dark moments that folks have been waiting for since Michael Crichton\u2019s book first hit shelves. This movie needs to be enjoyed in a setting that is as big and as loud as you can get it, simply because it deserves to loom larger-than-life over its audience. It\u2019s a shame that J.A. Bayona isn\u2019t returning for the third film, as his direction is a breath of fresh air in a series that seems to be setting up for a killer continuation and/or finale in the third planned film. In the here and now, this is the sort of dinosaur romp that makes the \u2018Jurassic World\u2019 saga something to pay attention to.\u201d"

            "Barcelona star Gerard Pique has landed himself in hot water with the club\u2019s managers over his involvement in a documentary which saw Atletico Madrid\u2019s Antoine Griezmann announce his decision to snub the Catalan giants.\nPique owns the production company that filmed \u201cThe Decision\u201d in which the French striker mulls a possible move to Barcelona before finally revealing his decision to sign a contract extension with Atletico through to 2023 instead.\nREAD ALSO: Tight security in Ekiti as APC holds mega rally\nThe documentary aired on Thursday on a Spanish pay TV channel and Griezmann, 27, on Monday signed the deal, which will reportedly see his salary rise to 20 million euros a year, making him the best paid player in the club\u2019s history.\nBarcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu has spoken to Pique and informed him that his role in making the video had \u201cgenerated surprise and discomfort within the club and among many of its supporters\u201d, Barcelona vice president Jordi Mestre told a news conference on Tuesday to present former player Eric Abidal as the team\u2019s new sports director.\n\u201cWe will speak internally with Gerard Pique and Samuel Umtiti after they return from the World Cup,\u201d he added.\nUmtiti apparently irked Barcelona\u2019s management as well because he replied to a Twitter message sent by Pique promoting the documentary by writing: \u201cI just need the popcorn\u201d.\n\u201cAt Barca we want players who are committed and determined to win here, above all. That said, we are sorry and we regret that the fans could have felt disappointed\u201d by Griezmann\u2019s final decision and the way it was delivered, said Mestre.\nPique has defended himself, saying he was not aware whether or not Griezmann was going to stay with Atletico when he got on board with the TV show and that the French player was unsure of what path to take until the last minute.\nHe wrote on Twitter that the documentary was \u201canother way to see the life of a football player and his doubts over the most important decision of his career\u201d.\n(AFP)"

            "A new update is live for Rainbow Six Siege primarily focusing on balancing changes and bug fixes. The update launched first on PC before also coming to Xbox One and PS4. Called Patch 2.2, the update makes several gameplay changes.\nThe first change affects how players deploy drones. Instead of immediately pulling into the drone camera's view upon deployment, players will have the choice between Standard and Advanced views. For Standard, the player's view changes to that of the drone upon deployment. For Advanced, the player's view remains with their Operator after throwing out a drone, and drone view will have to be manually switched to.\nPlayers also can now choose their preference for how they rotate through their team's Observation Tools. For Defenders, there are groups of Observation Tools, divided between the main collection of cameras and the groups of specialized cameras assigned to specific Operators, like Valkyrie. Before, Defenders rotated through all the cameras as one large group. Players can still do that if they prefer, or change their settings so the switch between different Observation Tool groups is manual instead of automatic.\nUbisoft is also rolling out the first few Operator and item balancing changes outlined in the company's Designer's Notes. We've highlighted the major ones here, but the full list of changes and bug fixes can be found on Ubisoft's Rainbow Six Siege blog.\nBalancing Changes\nFinka\nReduce ability duration from 20 seconds to 10 seconds\nStun grenades will be replaced with Frag grenades\nReduce Smoke\u2019s Gas Canister damage modifier\nAim down sights modifier from Adrenaline Rush reduced from -50% to -25%\nIQ\nFrag Grenades replaced with Claymore\nElectronics detection reduced from 20m to 15m\nBlackbeard\nIncrease MK17 damage from 42 to 49\nReduce SR-25 damage from 72 to 61\nReduce the hit points on the Rifle Shield from 60 to 50\n30% reduction in movement speed penalty when the Rifle Shield is equipped (He will move faster)\nGlaz\nReduce OTS-03 damage from 85 to 71\nTwitch\nReduce FAMAS damage from 40 to 37\nJackal\nIncrease footsteps scanning distance from 5m to 8m\nFrost\nIncrease SMG damage from 43 to 45\nIncrease Super 90 damage from 32 to 35\nDokkaebi\nClaymore will be replaced with Stun Grenades\nBarbed Wire"

        "articles": [
            "Game Info The Walking Dead: The Final Season - Episode 2 September 25, 2018 Platform PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch Publisher Telltale Games Developer Telltale Games\nThe Walking Dead: The Final Season was supposed to be the beginning of a new chapter for Telltale Games. Following a series of so-so releases and damning reports about working conditions at the studio, Telltale changed up their leadership and pledged to refocus and give The Walking Dead the sendoff it deserves. And it seemed like Telltale was going to deliver on their promise \u2013 The Walking Dead: The Final Season Episode 1 was a gripping return to form for the studio.\nAnd then it all went to hell. Late last week, Telltale unexpectedly announced they were closing their doors and cancelling all future projects. Telltale has yet to specifically spell it out, but word is The Walking Dead: The Final Season won\u2019t receive a proper conclusion. But Telltale did send out review codes for The Final Season Episode 2 just days before they pulled the plug, and thus I find myself in the slightly odd position of reviewing a finale that wasn\u2019t intended to be a finale. So, is this episode worth playing, or will it leave Telltale and Walker fans feeling dead inside?\nWarning: This review contains spoilers for The Walking Dead: The Final Season Episode 1.\nOn the previous episode of The Walking Dead: The Final Season, Clementine, now around 16, and her adopted son AJ were rescued and taken in by a group of teens who had set up camp in an abandoned boarding school. Being around kids her own age allowed Clem to finally let her guard down and it seemed like she and AJ had found a permanent home. Of course, this being The Walking Dead, something sinister was going on at the school \u2013 it turns out the kids\u2019 leader, Marlon, had secretly traded two members of the group to a band of raiders. When one of the other kids confronted Marlon about this, he lashed out, accidentally killing her. This was witnessed by Clementine, who got locked in a cellar with Marlon\u2019s zombified victim for her trouble. Clem survived and told everybody what Marlon had done, but, in a classic weasel move, he tried to pin it on her. Unfortunately, AJ decided to settle the argument by putting a bullet in Marlon\u2019s head. Cue Episode 2\u2026\nThe boarding school gang aren\u2019t thrilled about their leader\u2019s skull being ventilated, even if he was kind of a jerk, and so they vote to expel Clementine and AJ. Once out on their own, they quickly run afoul of the raider group Marlon did his dirty deal with, who just so happen to be led by somebody from Clementine\u2019s past. No spoilers, but Telltale went all the way back to Season One to unearth this character. A conflict ensues, during which AJ is shot, but, thankfully, our heroes are saved at the last minute by James, a former member of the Whisperers, who survives amongst the walkers by wearing a human skin mask. According to (the surprisingly hunky) James, the raiders are looking to forcibly recruit the kids at the school into their army, so Clem heads back to the school to get medical attention for AJ and warn them about the attack. With doom hanging over their heads, everybody agrees to let murderous bygones be bygones and begin preparing for the raiders\u2019 attack.\nThe Final Season Episode 1 told a simple story focused on character development and a more disturbing, psychological brand of horror. Episode 2, by comparison, is all about plot. Longtime fans of The Walking Dead may appreciate the callbacks to earlier Telltale seasons and references to the comics, but, ultimately, this episode just isn\u2019t as interesting as the first. It feels a bit padded, with a sequence in the school\u2019s greenhouse feeling particularly wedged in and contrary the previous episode\u2019s setup (why would these kids who are so concerned about maintaining a safe zone leave a bunch of walkers wandering around in a glass house on school grounds?) Also, if you\u2019re at all familiar with any iteration of The Walking Dead you\u2019ve probably already seen battles like the one at the end of this episode play out multiple times.\nThe Final Season Episode 2 isn\u2019t without its high points though, most of which come when it gets back around to the character-driven stuff. The \u201cpost-apocalyptic parenting sim\u201d feel of the first episode has been dialed back a bit, but there are still some downright heartbreaking scenes between Clem and AJ. The game asks you to consider what you would do if somebody you loved did something horrible \u2013 would you empathize with the victim/society, or is it family above all? A difficult question at the best of times, but an almost impossible one when the perpetrator is an adorable 5-year-old boy. In addition to the AJ stuff, there are also further hints there may be some romance in Clem\u2019s future, with the game allowing you to engage some cringe-worthy (in a fun way) teen flirting.\nUnfortunately, while this episode\u2019s writing is solid enough, it\u2019s action scenes take a turn for the worse. Episode 1 largely deemphasized action, but Episode 2 makes up for that with a boatload of quick-time events and a particularly annoying, glitchy walker-shooting sequence. Yeah, the action stuff is still easy enough to muscle through, but it was easier to ignore in the previous episode.\nThe Final Season Episode 2 lasts your standard 2 to 3 hours, and then it\u2019s done. Anybody hoping Telltale might have added something to the episode at the Eleventh Hour to provide fans with some closure are out of luck. The episode ends on a typical Walking Dead final page cliffhanger, except this time the next \u201cissue\u201d will probably never come. Dreadful sorry, Clementine.\nThis review was based on a PC copy of The Walking Dead: The Final Season Episode 2 provided by publisher Telltale Games. You can purchase the Season for Xbox One or PlayStation 4 via Amazon, for PC via Green Man Gaming.\n7 Wccftech Rating The Walking Dead: The Final Season - Episode 2 The Walking Dead: The Final Season - Episode 2\nAs a middle chapter of what was supposed to be a four-part series, The Walking Dead: The Final Season Episode 2 gets the job done just fine. It gets a bit bogged down in plot, but still delivers some moving scenes and interesting new and returning characters. As possibly the final statement of one of the best narrative video game developers of all time, it's a crushing disappointment. Here\u2019s hoping the remainder of The Walking Dead: The Final Season can somehow rise from the grave."

            "The Cleveland Browns need to get their roster down to 53 players by Saturday at 4:00 PM ET. Some NFL cuts may come in early, so we will begin to track them here in a live blog format. Please feel free to use the comments section to discuss cuts around the NFL who may be of interest to Cleveland.\nScroll to the bottom of this post for a raw list of today\u2019s reported cuts so far.\nBrowns Roster Cuts Live Blog\n4:25 PM: The Browns have named their initial 53-man roster!

Perhaps a practice squad addition. \u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) September 1, 2018\n2:28 PM: One minor name for the cut tracker: LB Brady Sheldon.\nLB Brady Sheldon, Cleveland Browns released per source \u2014 College2Pro.com (@BoMarchionte) September 1, 2018\n2:00 PM: We are about two hours away from the 4:00 PM deadline! We will have the cuts delivered to you very quickly upon the Browns announcing them, along with a reaction column later and then also a peek at the waiver wire candidates.\n11:42 AM: A semi-related Browns move from this morning: the Bills are cutting WR Corey Coleman. Per Mary Kay Cabot of the Plain Dealer, \u201cthey didn\u2019t like his attitude from the minute he showed up there.\u201d\nThe #Bills cut Corey Coleman less than a month after acquiring him in a trade with the #Browns, source confirms. They didn't like his attitude from the minute he showed up there. #Browns still get the 7th rounder in '19 https://t.co/SgrCmAi934 \u2014 Mary Kay Cabot (@MaryKayCabot) September 1, 2018\n11:35 AM: Summarizing a trade that happened earlier, the Chicago Bears were the team that emerged all of a sudden to acquire Khalil Mack from the Raiders. Reports say that Chicago was the only team willing to part with two first-round picks:\nBy the end of the day:\n\u2014 The #Bears will have Khalil Mack, who will be the highest-paid defensive player in football.\n\u2014 The #Raiders will have 2 first-round picks and more, plus $23M more per year to play with that would\u2019ve gone to Mack. \u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) September 1, 2018\n9:00 AM: The Browns have released punter Justin Vogel, according to ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter:\nBucs have released special teams captain Josh Robinson, per source.\nBrowns released punter Justin Vogel, per source Britton Colquitt wins the job. \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) September 1, 2018\n10:05 PM (Friday): More teams than just Cleveland are after Khalil Mack, but per Ian Rapoport of the NFL Network, trade rumors in general for Mack should heat up more on Saturday:\nWith less than 24 hrs to go before the cut-down day deadline, the trade market for #Raiders star pass-rusher Khalil Mack is robust, I\u2019m told. There are enough teams interested where the chances of Mack being traded is very real. Oakland is gauging and listening. Tune in tomorrow. \u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) September 1, 2018\n7:18 PM (Friday): Shon Coleman was just traded to the San Francisco 49ers for a 2019 7th round draft pick.\nGoing into training camp, Coleman was expected to compete for the starting LT position to replace the retired Joe Thomas. His time on the left side of the line was short lived as he was quickly moved back to the right, as the backup RT. Our story on it is up here.\n6:44 PM (Friday): This evening, Mary Kay Cabot of the Plain Dealer is reporting that Cleveland will talk to the Raiders about Khalil Mack:\nThe #Browns are expected to inquire about trading for #Raiders defensive end Khalil Mack, a league source tells clevelanddotcom https://t.co/VX9ocTXqV4 \u2014 Mary Kay Cabot (@MaryKayCabot) August 31, 2018\n4:00 PM (Friday): The Browns have announced 14 roster moves to get down to 72 players. The biggest names on the list are QB Brogan Roback, WR Jeff Janis, and LB Justin Currie. They are no where near \u201cshocks\u201d or even \u201csurprises\u201d \u2014 they are just a little more noteworthy than the other cuts.\n2:03 PM (Friday): According to Benjamin Albright on Twitter, the Browns have inquired about Khalil Mack, but \u201cnothing is imminent\u201d and he also would suggest that Cleveland is not the leader to get him, if he is traded.\n1:34 PM (Friday): In other big news, the Los Angeles Rams have locked up DT Aaron Donald to a jaw-dropping contract extension:\nLong time coming: Rams and Aaron Donald finalizing a record 6-year, $135 million, including $87 million guaranteed, per source. Richest defensive deal in NFL history.\nDonald now tied to LA for next seven years. And he will be ready for Monday night opener vs. Raiders. \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) August 31, 2018\nThe relevancy to the Browns is that \u201cthe market has been set\u201d for the Raiders\u2019 Khalil Mack and the new contract he will seek. The OBR has reported that the Browns are one of the teams looking to put a trade package together for Mack.\n1:31 PM (Friday): We may have our first Browns cut in: agent Andy Ross says that Cleveland is releasing OL Anthony Fabiano:\nAnthony Fabiano is getting released from Cleveland. #browns #nfl \u2014 Andy Ross (@adross77) August 31, 2018\n11:50 AM (Friday): A reminder that even after roster cuts are due, the Browns will be busy on the waiver wire with the top claim spot:\nA busy weekend of NFL moves is ahead. Remdiner: the waiver claim priority is the original 2018 draft order, a valuable tool to add some young talent. First five teams:\n1. Browns\n2. Giants\n3. Colts\n4. Texans\n5. Broncos \u2014 Field Yates (@FieldYates) August 31, 2018\n10:30 AM (Friday): As of Friday morning, the Browns\u2019 roster was at 86 players. They\u2019ll need to get down to 53 players, which comes out to 33 cuts. Cleveland began trimming their roster one day early last year, so we will be on the hunt for any cuts or player tweets. As a reminder, my final 53-man roster projection is here.\nList of Browns Roster Cuts So Far\nThis raw list will be updated Friday and Saturday as news comes in:\nOFFENSIVE PLAYERS CUT\nQB Brogan Roback\nWR Jeff Janis - Contract terminated\n- Contract terminated WR C.J.

            "UPDATE: Officials said Sunday afternoon that they had located Corey Brown's body. Updates are being posted here.\nORIGINAL STORY:\nMARSHALLTOWN, Ia. \u2014 The pews at St. Henry Catholic Church in Marshalltown began filling up long before Saturday evening's Mass began.\nParishioners arriving early to pray the rosary for a missing Marshalltown teen were greeted by a woman and her two daughters handing out green pins, missing 13-year-old Corey Brown\u2019s favorite color.\n\u201cIs this for the boy who ran away?\u201d a young girl asked aloud as Lisa Dougall pinned a green ribbon to a nearby churchgoer\u2019s coat. Recitation of the Hail Mary echoed in the background.\nDougall, a friend of Brown\u2019s parents, said the ribbons are just one way the community is trying \u201cto help bring Corey home.\u201d\n\u25ba The latest:Missing Marshalltown teen found dead after days-long search\nBrown was last seen Tuesday night when he left his parents\u2019 home in south Marshalltown after having a \"disciplinary discussion\" in which his phone was taken away, Police Chief Michael Tupper said during a news conference Thursday.\nThe search for the eighth-grader entered its fifth day Sunday as the community rallies around the missing boy and his family, amid extreme winter weather conditions.\nGreen ribbons were tied around trees and neighbors replaced porch lights with green bulbs \"to light the way for Corey to come home,\" Dougall said.\nBrown\u2019s parents pleaded for their son's return Thursday at the news conference at the Marshalltown library.\n\"Corey, you know how much we love you,\" his mother, Michelle, said, according to television station KCCI. \"And I\u2019m not going to stop until we find you. If you\u2019re out there, please come home.\"\n\u25ba More:'Keep praying for Corey and his family': New pleas for tips in search for Iowa boy missing for nearly 48 hours\nThe Marshalltown library's director, Sarah Rosenblum, couldn't help but relate this trial to the July twister that plowed through the city of 27,000, damaging numerous buildings including the downtown courthouse. Memories are now tied to a timeline marked \u201cbefore the tornado and after the tornado,\u201d she said.\n\"It's been a hard six months, and now ... this is, I wouldn\u2019t say a bookend to the first six months, but it's certainly been a difficult situation,\" Rosenblum said, calling Brown's disappearance \"another really hard blow.\"\nWindow after window along Marshalltown\u2019s Main Street, still in the midst of rebuilding efforts, were covered in posters featuring Corey\u2019s smiling face Saturday.\nInside one of the businesses, Charlotte Santana, 35, ran a vacuum cleaner through Treemont Grille, a green ribbon pinned to her shirt as she worked.\nShe was one of a couple hundred community members who gathered together Wednesday, many sporting snowsuits and winter boots, to offer their help to police.\nOfficials thanked the volunteers for their dedication, but they were asked to leave the physical search to the hands of a few dozen trained professionals.\n\u201cAfter the tornado, I felt the same unity,\" Santana said. \u201cWhen a family in the community is in need, people come to help.\u201d\nAnd the community did answer officials' requests to do their part, sharing Corey's smiling face. Santana estimated every third post on her Facebook feed is related to the search.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely what people are living right now,\" she said.\nMarshall County Crime Stoppers and Lennox Employees Credit Union on Friday announced a $1,000 reward for anyone with information that could lead to Brown's discovery, said Mayor Joel Greer, who also serves as the vice president of the local crime stoppers group.\nGreer said he has seen Marshalltown come together in ways he couldn't imagine during his first year in office.\n\u201cNow, when we have another thing that could be a tragedy, we\u2019re kind of geared up to help each other, communicate, with each other,\" he said. \"It\u2019s a better feeling in town than we had a year ago.\u201d\nGreer asked residents to remain hyper-vigilant, to report any tip they get and to keep praying.\nOfficials have asked all property owners in the city to closely check their homes, garages, sheds and any other buildings in case Brown has taken shelter through the frigid temperatures and snowstorm that hit the night he went missing. A winter weather advisory is in effect from 3 p.m. Sunday through noon Monday, according to the National Weather Service.\nBrown was last seen at about 11:15 p.m. Tuesday wearing a Seattle Seahawks stocking cap, a red shirt, black pants, gray shoes and a black and lime green coat, according to Marshalltown police. He is 5 feet tall with brown hair and weighs about 100 pounds, officials said.\nTupper said his team continues to explore all possible scenarios and to devote full resources to the search, though he wasn't able to comment on specific strategies on Saturday.\nBrown's family, communicating through the police chief, declined to comment.\nAnyone with information is encouraged to call the Marshalltown Police Department at 641-754-5725 or Crime Stoppers at 641-753-1234. Information can also be sent by texting the word \"marshall\" with any information to 274637 or online at MarshallCountyCS.com.\n\u25ba Previously:Why a handful of Iowa women volunteer their trained dogs to bring home the missing and the dead"

            "The FBI's pre-dawn arrest of President Trump's ex-adviser Roger Stone at his Florida home prompted critics to once again question the tactics of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, after more than a dozen special agents clad in tactical gear raided Stone's property Friday.\nStone, 66, was taken into custody early Friday after being indicted by a federal grand jury a day earlier as part of Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election. CNN, which conveniently happened to be staking out Stone's Fort Lauderdale home, posted video of the arrest that showed a team of FBI agents with guns banging on Stone\u2019s door and demanding that he come outside.\nROGER STONE VOWS TO FIGHT CHARGES IN MUELLER PROBE, CALLS INDICTMENT 'POLITICALLY MOTIVATED'\n\u201cAt the crack of dawn, 29 FBI agents arrived at my home with 17 vehicles, with lights flashing, when they could have contacted my lawyer,\u201d Stone explained after a court appearance Friday. \u201cBut the FBI agents were extraordinarily courteous.\u201d\nStone will appear on Fox News Channel's \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" on Friday at 8 p.m. ET.\nStone\u2019s attorney added that the arrest was a \u201cspectacle.\u201d\n\u201cA SWAT team, searching the house, scaring his wife, scaring his dogs\u2014it was completely unnecessary,\u201d Stone\u2019s attorney said. \u201cA telephone call would have done the job, and he would have appeared. Mr. Stone has nothing to hide.\u201d\nThe arrest operation drew scrutiny on social media\u2014even from President Trump, who said \u201cBorder Coyotes, Drug Dealers and Human Traffickers are treated better,\u201d and questioned \u201cwho alerted CNN to be there?\u201d\nOne federal law enforcement source told Fox News on Friday that the operation was \u201cstandard\u201d for a home arrest. The source told Fox News that home arrests typically take place early in the morning with a team of FBI agents in protective gear, adding that Stone\u2019s situation was \u201cnothing out of the ordinary.\u201d\nA former senior Justice Department official, now-white collar criminal attorney with Ifrah Law, James Trusty, told Fox News that while common procedure in white collar cases would involve a federal prosecutor contacting the defendant\u2019s attorney, Stone\u2019s charges could have sparked a different approach.\n\u201cIt shows that there is either a fundamental distrust of Mr. Stone, possibly due to the witness tampering charge, or that there was a real breakdown with his attorney,\u201d Trusty said Friday. \u201cThe wild card here is that in charging Stone with a form of obstruction of justice, the Mueller team may view it differently than typical white-collar investigations.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIf the FBI and the Mueller team believe Stone has engaged in witness tampering, then there is a palpable distrust, which would make them err on the side of surprise, rather than a courtesy phone call.\u201d\nFBI'S MANAFORT RAID INCLUDED A DOZEN AGENTS, 'DESIGNED TO INTIMIDATE,' SOURCE SAYS\nThe 24-page indictment released early Friday alleges that Stone worked to obstruct the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election by making false statements to the committee, denying he had records sought by the committee and persuading a witness to provide false testimony.\nThe indictment does not charge Stone with conspiring with WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy website that published the emails, or with the Russian officers Mueller says hacked them. Instead, it accuses him of witness tampering, obstruction and false statements about his interactions related to WikiLeaks' release.\nBut former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Joseph diGenova blasted the tactic as \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\u201cI am appalled that the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI have permitted a vindictive use of arrest in a non-violent case with a defendant who was willing to surrender,\u201d diGenova, who has informally been an adviser to the president throughout the Russia investigation, told Fox News. \u201cThis is an abuse of power and it underscores the vindictive nature of it by the fact that CNN was alerted ahead of time.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cFor those of us who have been prosecutors and have prosecuted mob figures, drug dealers and terrorists\u2014those are the people for whom these aggressive tactics are reserved. Not a Roger Stone.\u201d\n\u201cMake no mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was designed to be vindictive and intimidating.\u201d\nDiGenova likened the FBI arrest of Stone to the bureau\u2019s early morning raid last summer of the home of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\nStone on Friday said he would plead not guilty to the charges leveled against him by the special counsel\u2019s team, and said he \u201clooks forward to being fully and completely vindicated.\u201d\n\u201cI believe this is a politically motivated investigation,\u201d Stone said Friday. \u201cThere is no circumstance whatsoever under which I will bear false witness against the president, nor will I make up lies.\u201d\nPAUL MANAFORT COULD BE CHARGED WITH MORE CRIMES DOWN THE ROAD, PROSECUTOR TELLS JUDGE\nStone served as an adviser to Trump for years before Trump ran for president. He left Trump\u2019s campaign in August 2015, but maintained regular contact with and publicly supported the Trump campaign throughout the 2016 presidential election.\nMueller\u2019s investigation, which was initially ordered to look into the 2016 election, has gone on for more than a year and half. It has expanded to probe financial crimes of Trump associates before the election, conversations Trump\u2019s national security adviser had with the Russians during the transition and whether Trump obstructed justice with his comments and actions related to the probe.\nTwenty-six Russian nationals and three Russian companies have been charged with interfering in the 2016 presidential election. But none of the Trump associates connected to Trump have been charged with crimes related to collusion.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nOther convictions include former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, who both pleaded guilty to making false statements in 2017. Former campaign adviser Rick Gates in 2018 pleaded guilty and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted and later pleaded guilty in a separate financial crimes case dating back before the 2016 election.\nFormer Trump lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements in a case brought by Mueller in November. Alex van der Zwaan, a London-based lawyer, pleaded guilty to making false statements this year, and Richard Pinedo, a California man, pleaded guilty to identity fraud in 2018.\nFox News\u2019 Alex Pappas and Jake Gibson contributed to this report."

            "By RYAN TARINELLI and KEN MILLER\nDALLAS (AP) \u2014 A white Dallas police officer was arrested Sunday on a manslaughter charge in the off-duty shooting of a black neighbor whose apartment she says she mistook for her own.\nOfficer Amber Guyger was booked into the Kaufman County Jail after being taken into custody, the Texas Department of Public Safety said in a news release. The department said the investigation is ongoing and that no additional information was available.\nStart your day with the news you need from the Bay Area and beyond.\nSign up for our Morning Report weekday newsletter.\nA jail employee said Guyger was released on bond. Online records initially showed Guyger was in custody, but she later was not listed on the jail inmate roster.\nGuyger fatally shot 26-year-old Botham Jean on Thursday at Jean\u2019s apartment. Lawyers for Jean\u2019s family had been calling for Guyger\u2019s arrest, saying the fact that she had remained free days after the shooting showed she was receiving favorable treatment. They held a news conference Sunday night, shortly before the arrest was announced, making another plea for the officer to be taken into custody and saying their team had presented new evidence \u2014 a witness and video footage \u2014 to prosecutors. They didn\u2019t provide details.\nThe family attorneys weren\u2019t immediately available for comment after the arrest came.\nS. Lee Merritt, one of the attorneys for Jean\u2019s family, said Saturday that the man\u2019s loved ones weren\u2019t calling on the authorities to jump to conclusions or to deny Guyger her right to due process. But Merritt said they wanted Guyger \u201cto be treated like every other citizen, and where there is evidence that they\u2019ve committed a crime, that there\u2019s a warrant to be issued and an arrest to be made.\u201d\nGuyger, 30, is a four-year veteran of the police force. The Dallas Police Department released her name Saturday night.\nPolice Chief U. Renee Hall said the day after the shooting that her department was seeking manslaughter charges against Guyger. But she said Saturday that the Texas Rangers, who have taken over the investigation, asked her department to hold off because they had learned new information and wanted to investigate further before a warrant was issued.\nJean\u2019s family has also hired attorney Benjamin Crump, who is best known for representing the families of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown. Martin, a black, unarmed 17-year-old, was shot and killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer in 2012 in Sanford, Florida. Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old, was shot and killed by a white police officer in 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri.\nCrump has also represented the families of Stephon Clark and Terence Crutcher, both also black and unarmed. Clark, 22, was fatally shot earlier this year by officers in the backyard of his grandparents\u2019 home in Sacramento, California. Crutcher, 40, was shot and killed by a white police officer in 2016 in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\nAccording to police, Guyger shot and killed Jean after returning in uniform to the South Side Flats, where they both had apartments, following her shift. She reported the shooting to dispatchers and she told officers who responded that she had mistaken Jean\u2019s apartment for her own.\nMany questions remain about what led Guyger to shoot Jean. Hall said the officer\u2019s blood was drawn at the scene so that it could be tested for alcohol and drugs. Investigators haven\u2019t released the results of those tests.\nJean\u2019s mother, Allison Jean, wondered whether race could have been a factor. Her son, who grew up in the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia before attending college in Arkansas, is black. Guyger is white.\n\u201cIf it was a white man, would it have been different? Would she have reacted differently?\u201d Allison Jean said Friday.\nJean wasn\u2019t the first person shot by Guyger. She shot another man, Uvaldo Perez, on May 12, 2017, while she was on duty.\nAccording to an affidavit in the case filed against Perez, police were looking for a suspect when Guyger and another officer were called to assist a third. Perez got out of a car and became combative with Guyger and another officer. A struggle began and Guyger fired her Taser at Perez, who then wrested it away from her. She then drew her gun and fired, wounding Perez in the abdomen.\nGuyger was not charged in the 2017 shooting.\nSgt. Mike Mata, president of Dallas\u2019 largest police employee organization, the Dallas Police Association, on Saturday called for an \u201copen, transparent and full investigation of the event,\u201d the Dallas Morning News reported.\nRelated Articles Crime and Public Safety | Despite years of shootings, beatings and dog bites, these East Bay cops have avoided discipline.

            "Ryanair has been criticised for apparently failing to remove a passenger from a plane after he launched a racist tirade against the woman in the seat next to him. Photograph: Christian Hartmann/Reuters.\nRyanair has reported to UK police an incident on a plane in which a passenger was filmed shouting racial abuse to a woman in the seat next to him.\nThe airline had been criticised for apparently failing to remove the man from the plane, who was filmed by a fellow passenger calling the elderly woman an \u201cugly black bastard\u201d, and shouting \u201cdon\u2019t talk to me in a foreign language you stupid ugly cow\u201d.\nIn a statement, released on Monday Ryanair said:\nThis racist white man refused to sit next to an elderly black woman on a Ryanair flight.\nHe called her an \"ugly black bastard\" & threatened to push her to another seat if she didn't move to another seat.\nRyanair - DOES NOTHING!!!\nUK twitter identify HIM!!!\nRETWEET THIS! pic.twitter.com/70XNsvTZBg \u2014 StanceGrounded (@_SJPeace_) October 20, 2018\n\u201cWe have reported this to the police in Essex and as this is now a police matter, we cannot comment further.\u201d\nREAD MORE\nThe footage was recorded on Friday on Ryanair flight FR015 from Barcelona to London Stansted by UK resident David Lawrence who uploaded it on to social media. It shows the man shouting at the woman to move seats while her daughter tries to stand up to him, telling him her mother is disabled.\nHe replies: \u201cI don\u2019t care whether she\u2019s f****** disabled or not \u2014 if I tell her to get out she gets out.\u201d\nThe man then calls her \u201can ugly f****** c***\u201d and tells staff to move the woman to another seat, adding: \u201cif you don\u2019t go to another seat I\u2019ll push you to another seat\u201d.\nStaff on the flight seemed to do little to silence the man during the footage, leaving a passenger in the row behind to try and deal with the situation.\n\u2018Rude\u2019\nThe cabin crew can be heard to say: \u201cDon\u2019t be so rude, you have to calm down\u201d while other passengers call for the man to be thrown off the flight.\nThe victim can be heard telling the man he stinks and needs a wash, before asking to be moved so she can sit next to her daughter.\nThe row apparently broke out after the elderly woman was unable to move out of her aisle seat quickly enough to let the man sit down in his window seat.\nThe incident was retweeted thousands of times after Twitter user @StanceGrounded uploaded Mr Laurence\u2019s clip, prompting widespread condemnation of Ryanair for failing to act swiftly.\nA number of politicians voiced their concern at Ryanair\u2019s apparent lack of action.\nLabour MP for East Hull and shadow attorney general Karl Turner tweeted: \u201cHe should have been removed from the flight and handed over to the police.\n\u201cWe assume the aircraft was in the UK. If it was he definitely committed criminal offences. I fully expect Ryanair to confirm the situation if in fact it was their flight.\u201d\n\u2018Appalling\u2019\nMSP for Greenock and Inverclyde Stuart McMillan posted: \u201cThis is really appalling Ryanair .

            "After a brief 217 day absence, the Patriots play their first meaningful game since the Super Bowl this Sunday. Opening the year in Foxboro\u2019s Gillette Stadium, they\u2019ll be hosting a Bill O\u2019Brien-led Texans team for the fifth time in the last four years, six if you include the 2017 preseason game and joint practices from that week.\nFeaturing an electric young quarterback in Deshaun Watson, the Texans are coming off of a lost year when seemingly their entire starting lineup was injured. They didn\u2019t have a first or second round pick because of their last two quarterbacks, using the one to trade up for Watson and the two to dump Brock Osweiler\u2019s awful contract. Despite those woes, the Texans are always a tough matchup \u2013 especially when healthy on their defense.\nScouting the Texans\u2019 offense\nDeshaun Watson\nBelichick\u2019s Patriots have historically dominated Bill O\u2019Brien\u2019s Texans, as well as other coaches from his tree. But when preparing for the 2018 Texans, it\u2019s fair to say that only the game film from 2017 seems to be relevant, at least for their offense. Watson stole the starting job from an undeserving Tom Savage halfway through week 1 last year and looked like he belonged immediately. Watson was well on his way to winning offensive rookie of the year before he went down with a freak right ACL tear in practice in November.\nSunday\u2019s matchup will be just over ten months since the injury. Based on his preseason, Watson didn\u2019t look limited, but it\u2019s important to factor in the human aspect of injury. While Watson dazzled with his mobility with plays like these...\nI wouldn\u2019t expect to see a whole lot of plays like this on Sunday. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Watson is still mobile and the Patriots are right to treat him like one with the scout team quarterbacks, but I would be shocked if Watson approached the many out of the pocket passes and eight rushes that he had against the Patriots last year in his first real NFL game back.\nIf I were the Patriots, I would embrace what de-facto defensive coordinator Brian Flores has done with the Patriots defense in the preseason and send more pressure at Watson. The Texans\u2019 offensive line was terrible in 2017 and the only member of the line that started week 3 that will start on Sunday is center Nick Martin. But to be honest, the replacements that the Texans brought in don\u2019t inspire that much confidence.\nAt left tackle, they are starting Julien Davenport, a second year project fourth round tackle that was pretty poor in spot starts last year. At right tackle is Seantrel Henderson, an old Bills foe that hasn\u2019t started a game at tackle since 2015 because of Crohn\u2019s disease and all the weed he had to smoke to manage the pain. And they\u2019ll start two guys at guard that don\u2019t really scare anyone in Zach Fulton and Senio Kelemete. The Patriots will be able to get pressure with a four-man rush, but they should be able send extra guys because...\nDefending the skill players\n...without the available draft capital, the Texans didn\u2019t upgrade their offensive skill players, returning a group of DeAndre Hopkins, Will Fuller, Ryan Griffin, and Lamar Miller. With apologies to Sammie Coates, Tyler Ervin, Jordan Akins, and Keke Coutee, the Texans\u2019 fifth offensive skill player should not present an obstacle to the Patriots\u2019 defense. A game plan of the 6\u20191 Eric Rowe with the safety shaded to his side on Hopkins, and Gilmore on Will Fuller makes a lot of sense, leaving the other guys with winnable matchups.\nFor the Texans offense, a lot hinges on how good Watson will be and how much of a threat he is as a mobile QB just ten months removed from a surgery that usually takes a full year to recover full explosiveness. The Patriots couldn\u2019t have done a worse job with Watson last year, but they return with an improved and more athletic defense that should be up to the task.\nScouting the Texans\u2019 defense\nLet\u2019s talk about the pressure\nDespite having missed most of the last few years with injuries, the face of the Texans\u2019 franchise is still J.J. Watt, who at his peak was clearly the best defensive player in the NFL. And while he isn\u2019t the same monster that he once was, he\u2019s still among the best in the game with Jadeveon Clowney and Whitney Mercilus feasting off of the double teams he still draws.\nLast year, the Patriots struggled mightily to contain the dangerous trio in their one-on-one matchups. Brady was sacked five times, including a fumble-six forced by Mercilus on a clean win against Solder:\nEven when the Patriots completed some nice plays, Brady was getting hit, and hit hard \u2013 nine times to be exact. Here are the four non-sack hits on Brady from that game:\nThis was probably Brady's best throw last year. Clowney and McKinney destroy Thuney and Solder with a stunt and both Mercilus and Watt draw double teams on the right.\nThe Texans D-Line is so dangerous. Expect a heavy dose of Develin and Allen on Sunday. pic.twitter.com/IG107bRDAT \u2014 Tian (@tianrossi) September 6, 2018\nThis is the same exact play and protection with McKinney and Mercilus switched. That kind of pressure is way too easy against a 6 man protection. Thank God that Tom Brady is Tom Brady. pic.twitter.com/5KcE9nWlLo \u2014 Tian (@tianrossi) September 6, 2018\nOn each of those four plays, the Texans run some sort of stunt and get a hit in on Brady. It\u2019s on the left tackle and guard in the first three clips and over the center on the fourth clip. This kind of quick pressure generated by four players against a 6-man protection is just unreal and speaks to the talent of the Texans\u2019 defensive linemen. On four of the biggest plays of the game, the Patriots felt compelled to have their most talented skill player chip in protection, and despite that, pressure made it through.\nThe Texans have made a change at defensive coordinator with Vrabel off coaching the Titans, but the scheme should remain the same. Romeo Crennel (who was also the defensive coordinator in Texas from 2014-16) runs the same kind of schemes and Belichick is obviously well acquainted with his strategy as well. I expect the Patriots to be much better prepared for the Texans\u2019 pass rush.\nPersonnel\nThe Patriots\u2019 top three wide receivers in that game were Chris Hogan, Brandin Cooks, and Danny Amendola, with Phillip Dorsett only chipping in with seven snaps as the fourth wideout. Hogan, Dorsett, and Cordarrelle Patterson is obviously a step back from that trio and I suspect that the Patriots will adjust accordingly. In last year\u2019s game, James Develin and Dwayne Allen played a combined 50% of defensive snaps. This Sunday that number should be closer to 100%. The Patriots need to take advantage of Mercilus and Clowney covering and playing the run in their base defense.\nThe Patriots are still going to have to chip Watt and Clowney on the edges and ideally, they would prefer that guy to be Allen. I would also bet on the Patriots inserting some tight end screens or phantom blocks into the game plan to take advantage if the Texans get too aggressive.\nFor the rest of the Texans\u2019 defense, the Patriots should have an advantage against the secondary, but it has improved over recent years. One common theme from the Texans over the last decade or so has been that they could never have quality safety play. From Danieal Manning to D.J. Swearinger to Andre Hal to Quintin Demps to Eddie Pleasant to Corey Moore... you get the picture, they have all been mediocre fill-ins at best.\nThis offseason, they finally realized the position to be a glaring weakness and signed Tyrann Mathieu, while moving back long time cornerback Kareem Jackson to safety to shore up the position. It will be very interesting to see how those two match up against Gronkowski and James White/Rex Burkhead because both of their starting linebackers (McKinney and Zach Cunningham) can\u2019t cover for shit.\nJohnathan Joseph is somehow still starting for them at CB along with Kevin Johnson and ex-Jag slot guy Aaron Colvin. Not a group that is going to shut you down, but a group that has seen Brady many times and could pose a problem to one of the weakest and shallowest wide receiver positional groups that Brady has ever had.\nMy two cents on the Patriots offense: heavy on the ground game and bigger personnel to set up play-action passing. While the Texans mostly relied on a four-man rush in obvious passing situations, according to PFF they were the tied for the most aggressive team in the NFL when it came to blitzing on 1st down, making them even more susceptible to this strategy.\nFinal Thoughts\nIt seems criminal to type out 1,500 words and not mention the special teams battle so I guess I\u2019ll put a little blurb in here. The Texans have consistently been a bottom-ten special teams positional group and they fired Patriots special teams legend Larry Izzo as their coach in the offseason. It\u2019s too early to tell if there will be improvements, but the Patriots should be able to comfortably outplay them in that aspect of the game. I\u2019m excited to see Cordarrelle Patterson in the return game.\nAll in all, the Texans are no pushover, and represent a real threat to the Patriots in their home opener. That being said, I think that the Patriots learn from their first meeting with Watson and win and cover on Sunday. I think that there will be plenty of scoring drives for both sides but I don\u2019t see how they have the second highest over/under of the week. For all of the betting men out there, I\u2019ll take Patriots (-6.5) and the under (51).\nWeek 1 prediction: Patriots 27 Texans 20"

            "Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri has revealed his relief over Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s availability to face Man Utd while also insisting his side can still improve.\nThe Portuguese superstar was sent off against Valencia in their opening Champions League game this month, leading to an anxious wait to determine how long his suspension would be.\nSEE MORE: Juventus set sights on Serie A sensation to bolster Massimiliano Allegri\u2019s attacking options\nAs noted by BBC Sport, he will miss the next encounter with Young Boys, but will return to then face his former club Manchester United at Old Trafford next month, having only been forced to sit out one game.\nAlthough the 33-year-old has had a slow start to life in Italy, he is beginning to pick up the pace and emerge as a decisive figure for the Turin giants.\nRonaldo has scored three goals and provided two assists in seven games so far this season, and there is little doubt that he will become more crucial as the campaign goes on both domestically and in Europe.\nWith that in mind, particularly given the magnitude of the game and that it could be crucial to determining who finishes top of the group, Allegri is pleased that he\u2019ll have Ronaldo back available in Manchester while he also discussed the improvement that he wants to see in his side\u2019s performances.\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy that we\u2019ll have him in Manchester, he\u2019s doing well,\u201d he told the media, as reported by Calciomercato. \u201cWe have all the time ahead to improve together on our build-up work, then we just need to improve on how to find him and find him quickly to get the best out of him.\u201d\nThere are still arguably issues over his partnership with Paulo Dybala, with Allegri tasked with the challenge of ensuring they get the best out of each other. Given the quality that they possess, if they can strike the right balance, it will surely lead to more major honours this season for the reigning Italian champions."

            "10 youngsters in Rajkot have been reportedly arrested by the police for playing PUBG in public place. The Rajkot administration earlier issued a ban on the game in public places and sent suggestions to other state governments for applying a complete ban on the game.\nBy Amritanshu Mukherjee: Earlier in the day, reports of the Rajkot police nabbing 10 youngsters for playing PUBG came in. The police arrested 10 individuals who were found to play PUBG on their smartphones in the public place. The arrests were made based on the charges issued under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code for violating an order issued by the Police Commissioner and Section 35 for playing PUBG despite the ban by the Gujarat Police Act. The game was banned in Rajkot by the Police Commissioner a few days ago.\nadvertisement\nPUBG was in the news for a long time since reports of the game spoiling youngsters as well as grown-ups. The game has been often accused of spreading violence among children and has led them to divert attention from academics, affecting their overall development. PUBG has been framed to be highly addictive even for grown-ups. The negative-effects of PUBG have been so concerning that a concerned mother recently took the issue to Indian PM Narendra Modi in the \"Pariksha Pe Charcha 2.0\" event.\nIf you have been wondering why a ban was implemented on PUBG, here's all you need to know the \"PUBG Ban\" chapter.\nWhat is PUBG?\nPlayerUnknown's BattleGround, widely known as PUBG to the world, was introduced last year on PC, consoles and mobile platforms. PUBG belongs to the battle royale genre where players jump along with 99 other players on a virtual battlefield and fight it out amongst themselves. The last man standing wins the match. Unlike other battle royale games, PUBG offers a military-themed realistic experience. PUBG is available for free on mobile platforms and is available for Rs 999 on Steam.\nWhy is PUBG being banned?\nSince its introduction, PUBG has been considered as one of the most popular games, both on mobiles as well as PC. The game's immense popularity has led to the development of communities who live and breathe PUBG. The multiplayer gameplay mode encourages friends to play along with each other. And that's where the problem rises.\nPUBG has been accused of causing distraction from academics among youngsters. The violent nature of the game has also been under suspicion for altering children's behaviour. Additionally, grown-ups have also been reported to be affected by the game badly, with some of them even being hospitalised due to the game's addiction.\nReported incidents of PUBG's negative effects\n--A fitness trainer in Jammu was traumatized while playing the game. The man started punching himself after getting addicted to the game and injured himself badly. He had to be hospitalised and underwent medical treatment.\n--A teenager in Mumbai committed suicide after his parents denied of purchasing an expensive smartphone to play PUBG.\n--A Malaysian man was reported to leave his family and his pregnant wife after he was \"disturbed\" from playing PUBG.\nWhere has the ban been implemented yet\nSo far, the biggest news of PUBG ban is coming from Gujarat, where the Rajkot administration has issued a formal ban on the game. The police have been directed to make arrests if someone is seen playing PUBG in public places.\nadvertisement\nGujarat's primary education department also issued a circular to ban the game after the recommendation of the Gujarat State Commission for Protection of Child Rights. The district education officers have been tasked to carry necessary measures to ban the game in schools.\nThe Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) was also reported to ban the game inside its campus.\nPublic reaction\nBroadly, it has been mixed.\n--A section of the public, including parents, authorities and some children have welcomed the ban. Some people on Twitter have been expressing their emotions, agreeing that game's negative effect on the lives of its players has been noticeable and a ban would certainly help youngsters get back on track. \"I completely support the criminalising of PUBG. Such games have a negative impact on the minds of people like me who are unable to play it well, despite of the tremendous peer pressure,\" wrote one user.\n--However, a majority of people have raised their voice against the ban. Many have argued that a ban isn't the only solution to a game that's deemed harmful to the people. There is no official proof to suggest that PUBG is dangerous. Some have even questioned the government's take on the issue of Internet freedom. Check out some of these tweets below:\nadvertisement\nYes, #PUBG players are being arrested in Gujarat as per news reports. Criminalising the use of gaming technologies is massive blow to individual liberty. We will be following this up.\nFull report : https://t.co/ob2N0lrrsw https://t.co/LH2GxPzOPR Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) (@internetfreedom) March 14, 2019\n--- ENDS ---"

            "Tampa Bay Lightning at Columbus Blue Jackets: Round 1, Game 3\nTime: 7:00 pm Eastern Time\nLocation: Nationwide Arena\nBroadcast/Streaming: NBCSN, TVAS\nOpponent SBNation Site: The Cannon\nRegular season stats: Tampa Bay Lightning (5-3-1, 9 points) Goals For (Per Game): 32 (3.56) Goals Against (Per Game): 29 (3.22) PP%: 24.00% (10th) PK%: 70.97% (27th) CF%: 48.0% (24th) Nashville Predators (6-3-1, 13 points) Goals For (Per Game): 42 (4.20) Goals Against (Per Game): 32 (3.20) PP%: 19.44% (16th) PK%: 70.97% (28th) CF%: 50.9% (11th) All statistics from Hockey Reference and Natural Stat Trick.\nPreview\nBefore the start of the Playoffs, few people expected that the Tampa Bay Lightning would trail 0-2 to the Columbus Blue Jackets before heading to Ohio. Even after the Game 1 loss, most expected the Lighting to level the series because it felt like the Lightning just stopped playing after taking over a 3-0 lead. The expectation was that they\u2019d learned a lesson and it wouldn\u2019t happen again. But now it\u2019s a reality and the team have to deal with it.\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of people comparing this situation to the last season\u2019s playoffs, when the Jackets eventually lost to the Washington Capitals after leading 2-0 before coming to homestand. I think this is a little bit different, the Jackets have earned both wins last postseason in overtime, thanks to outstanding perfomance by Sergei Bobrovsky. This time, the Bolts were seemed nearly helpless in some situations, allowing unnecessary turnovers and not being able to convert any of their power plays at the Game 2.\nNikita Kucherov has been suspended for tonight\u2019s game for an avoidable boarding of defenceman Markus Nutivaara. He should be happy that it\u2019s just for one game, as some expected a multiple game suspension. Kucherov\u2019s hit reflects the team\u2019s frustration after Game 2, which was also showed when Victor Hedman exchanged some words with the Columbus bench and when Jon Cooper called this loss \u201ca five-alarm fire\u201c\n\"Victor Hedman comes over and says to the Columbus bench, 'You guys are really good at this. Last year you were up 2-0 too. How'd it end up?'\"@NHLonNBCSports Inside-the-Glass analyst Pierre McGuire caught the exchange at the end of Columbus' 5-1 win vs. Tampa on Friday. pic.twitter.com/QXOP0XY4Qn \u2014 NBC Sports PR (@NBCSportsPR) April 13, 2019\nBefore traveling to Columbus, the Lightning held an unplanned practice in Brandon. Anton Stralman didn\u2019t participated again and Hedman was also absent. Per Jon Cooper, Hedman \u201cgot a little banged up last night\u201d but hopefully will be ready for tonight\u2019s game. Kucherov practiced with Danick Martel and will be replaced by Ryan Callahan during his suspension. Mathieu Joseph was promoted to the first line.\nJan Rutta was criticized by many fans after last game. He worked with Braydon Coburn on Saturday morning, so it\u2019s hard to say if we\u2019ll see changes on the blueline. Cameron Gaunce also re-joined the team from Syracuse this morning indicating that Hedman\u2019s status is uncertain for tonight. If the Lightning are without both Kucherov and Hedman tonight, that would not bode well for the team\u2019s chances to get back in the series tonight.\nCameron Gaunce in the building, may be insurance on D for #TBLightning. Hedman got \u201cbanged up\u201d Friday. We should know more on his status today at optional skate \u2014 Joe Smith (@JoeSmithTB) April 14, 2019\nMeanwhile, the Columbus Blue Jackets signed russian defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov to an entry level deal. He will join the team as soon as he gets a U.S. work visa and will probably help his new team before the end of the series.\n#CBJ sign defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov to a two-year entry level contract.https://t.co/IXl7BlwgRe \u2014 x-Columbus Blue Jackets (@BlueJacketsNHL) April 13, 2019\nNo big changes to the Jackets lineup are not expected for the Game 3.\nTampa Bay Lightning\nForwards\nMathieu Joseph - Steven Stamkos - Yanni Gourde\nOndrej Palat - Brayden Point - Tyler Johnson\nAlex Killorn - Anthony Cirelli - JT Miller\nAdam Erne - Cedric Paquette - Ryan Callahan\nScratched: Danick Martel\nSuspended: Nikita Kucherov\nDefense\nVictor Hedman - Dan Girardi\nRyan McDonagh - Erik Cernak\nMikhail Sergachev - Jan Rutta\nScratched: Braydon Coburn\nInjured: Anton Stralman\nGoalies\nAndrei Vasilevskiy\nLouis Domingue\nColumbus Blue Jackets\nForwards\nArtemi Panarin - Pierre-Luc Dubois - Cam Atkinson\nRyan Dzingel - Matt Duchene - Josh Anderson\nNick Foligno - Boone Jenner - Oliver Bjorkstrand\nAlexandre Texier - Riley Nash - Brandon Dubinsky\nDefense\nZach Werenski - Seth Jones\nMarkus Nutivaara - David Savard\nDean Kukan - Scott Harrington\nGoalies\nSergei Bobrovsky\nJoonas Korpisalo"

            "CLEMSON \u2013 Clemson shook off the Not-Making-the-NCAA-Tournament blues long enough to dispatch Wright State in its NIT opener Tuesday night at Littlejohn Coliseum, then pondered the prospect of facing whatever lies ahead without graduate point guard Shelton Mitchell.\nMitchell, who has battled through knee pain each of the past two seasons, started all 32 of the Tigers games this season, but was unable to go Tuesday after a Monday MRI revealed that another surgery will be in his immediate future.\nSo is his college career finished, regardless of how far Clemson advances in this tournament?\n\u201cI think so, yeah,\u201d Brownell said. \u201cIt was really bothering him here down the stretch.\u201d\nAs a veteran point guard, Mitchell\u2019s contributions to the team went far beyond his 11.5 points and 3.0 assists per game.\nMitchell, who transferred to Clemson following a freshman season at Vanderbilt, was a steadying influence, a savvy player who\u2019d helped navigate this team through the thick and the thin over the past few seasons, including a memorable 25-10 and Sweet 16 season a year ago and a disheartening series of close defeats in Atlantic Coast Conference play this season that in the end made the difference between March Madness and simply March Mad.\n\u201cWe kind of knew we probably weren\u2019t going to get in, but you\u2019re still optimistic,\u201d Brownell said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not easy to flip the switch and immediately go right back into it.\u201d\nThe Tigers gutted their way to a 75-69 victory against Wright State in front of a sparse, spring break-impacted crowd of 1,718.\nSophomore guard Clyde Trapp started in place of Mitchell and contributed 12 points, but the bulk of the scoring burden going forward will have to fall on the considerable shoulders of Elijah Thomas and considerable talents of Marcquise Reed, who scored 24 points Tuesday for his 15th game this season with 20 or more points.\nAs the game wore on, Clemson appeared to push aside any Sunday Selection Show disappointment and go into full-fledged scrappy mode.\nMitchell\u2019s career appears to be over, but there are five others on the Clemson roster who aren\u2019t ready to turn in their stripes.\n\u201cLosing Shelton is hard on us, but I\u2019m excited that some of our younger guys got the opportunity to play and produce,\u201d Brownell said. \u201cAnd that will have to continue if we want to continue on. Our guys responded and we\u2019re going to try to keep piecing it together here.\u201d\nClemson, which is seeded No. 2 in its NIT bracket, could host No. 3 Furman in the second round if the Paladins can knock off Wichita State on Wednesday, which would add another level of intrigue for a series whose last installment came in 2013.\nWright State coach Scott Nagy helped put the NIT challenge in perspective.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a team in this tournament that\u2019s coming off a win and nobody immediately wants to be in it,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to practice when you don\u2019t know who you\u2019re playing. Then you\u2019re trying to get your guys motivated. This is a good tournament, but how do you convince your guys of that? If we could\u2019ve won this game, it probably would have been the biggest win in our postseason history.\u201d\nThere is one major selling point \u2013 namely punching a ticket to New York City and the famed basketball mecca of Madison Square Garden.\n\u201cThe NIT\u2019s not a bad tournament,\u201d Reed said. \u201cKeep winning and you go to Madison Square Garden where most of the greats have played.\u201d\nClemson has advanced to New York three times previously and lost in the NIT Championship Game twice, most recently in 2007.\nThe allure of a possible bite of the Big Apple is there and the pursuit of that may serve as a salve to a team on the outside looking in at the real March Madness.\n\u201cThe guys on the team watch games there, they\u2019ve heard about it,\u201d Brownell said. \u201cSo the chance to do that is a significant accomplishment. There\u2019s some cool factor to it, no question.\u201d\nAnd a not-so-bad consolation prize for a team that had higher aspirations."

            "More than a few eyebrows were raised yesterday when Alberto Moreno was in the team sheet to start against Cardiff City.\nOnce a serious contender to start, there is no zero doubt in any minds that Andy Robertson is the best left back at the club. When there\u2019s a big game, he\u2019s going to play. Of course, he\u2019s only human, and occasionally he will need a rest. A home game against Cardiff seemed the ideal opportunity. Enter Moreno.\nOf course, Moreno seemed to get beaten very easily by two Cardiff players on their way to scoring the Welsh side\u2019s only goal of the game. The knives were out for a player who frequently frustrates the Anfield faithful.\nNot in the eyes of Sadio Mane, though, who blames himself.\n\u201cA team like this are never easy to play\u201d, the Liverpool Echo report Mane as saying. \u201cSometimes you have to be patient, try not to lose the ball. At the end we scored four goals and deserved to win\n\u201cI think we conceded because we lacked communication. Normally I am with Alberto [Moreno] on the left but I was in midfield and [one on one] it is not easy for Moreno.\n\u201cThat is part of football, we will try to learn from that.\u201d\nHumility aside, Mane does raise a significant point in assigning blame for conceding goals. Defending is a collective exercise, much more than attacking, and a mistake by a defender is usually the result of a mistake by someone higher up the pitch. Leicester City\u2019s distinctly average centre backs looked superhuman with N\u2019Golo Kante in front of them, and have since returned to looking mediocre. Dejan Lovren struggled horribly before he was playing in a better structured pressing system with Virgil van Dijk alongside him. When Mane says he was out of position, he was correct. While Moreno did do poorly on the goal, in another reality he would have never been called into action.\nExcellent understanding of collective responsibility, Sadio."

Dietrich dropped his bat and stood in the batter\u2019s box and watched the ball clear the fence atop the Clemente Wall and bounce into the Allegheny River.\nThings got heated between the Reds and Pirates.

Bell jogged from the dugout to the infield, arguing Archer should have been ejected. Players from both dugouts and bullpens followed, and Reds outfielder Yasiel Puig grabbed Pirates bench coach Tom Prince in a headlock. Pirates closer Felipe Vazquez and set-up man Keone Kela were also in the middle of the fray.\nBell, Kela, Puig and Vazquez were ejected, as was Reds reliever Amir Garrett. Matt Kemp replaced Puig, and Archer was allowed to remain in the game."

            "Time Magazine released its annual 100 Most Influential People issue and for the first time, a soccer player is one of the covers. That cover player is Liverpool and Egyptian National Team forward Mohamed Salah.\nSalah is on one of six individual covers in 2019, along with Gayle King, Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, Nancy Pelosi, Sandra Oh, and Taylor Swift.\nSalah\u2019s entry is written by Last Week Tonight host and Liverpool fan John Oliver, and his inclusion is warranted not only because he is one of the best soccer players in the world, but because he\u2019s a Muslim who doesn\u2019t minimize his faith. In a world where only the terrible actions of Muslim extremists are publicized, Salah transcends that through his play to be one of the top players without sacrificing his religious beliefs.\nAs a result, Salah is using his influence as a world famous soccer player to hopefully bring change to the Middle East. In an interview with Time, Salah called on the region to change how they treat women and grant them the same rights that men are granted. It\u2019s unlikely that the words of one man will bring change to the region, but it\u2019s worth a shot.\nSalah is not the only soccer player on the Most Influential list. USWNT and Orlando Pride striker Alex Morgan was also included in advance of this summer\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup and with her campaigning to have the US Women be paid the same as the US Men at the front of many people\u2019s minds.\nThree other athletes, in addition to Salah and Morgan, were included on Time\u2019s list. Warren Buffet wrote about LeBron James\u2019 achievements off the basketball court, including the many shows he\u2019s producing as well as his \u201cI Promise\u201d school in his hometown of Akron, which has seen \u201cextraordinary results\u201d for the disadvantaged kids who go there.\nTwo-time gold medalist Edwin Moses wrote about track star Caster Semenya as she fights the perception many have about the differences between men and women. Semenya is a woman, but her natural testosterone levels are higher than the average woman, leading some to question her gender and opine that she has a major advantage over other women.\nJustin Timberlake wrote about Tiger Woods. This had to have been planned before Tiger\u2019s win at The Masters this Sunday, but his inclusion was perfect timing for a story about the best golfer in the world falling from grace, turning his life around, and proving a lot of doubters wrong to get back to the top of the golf world.\n[Time]"

            "The return of Tom Trbojevic can't come soon enough for Manly and Daly Cherry-Evans needs to start firing.\nThe Sea Eagles also lost, but they finished the game strongly against the Roosters and might feel like they learned something about themselves.\nAfter a good first-round home win over the Bulldogs, the Warriors weren't able to stick with the Tigers last week at Campbelltown and crashed to a heavy loss.\nStrange as it may seem, winless Manly might actually go into this Saturday afternoon encounter with more momentum and confidence than the Warriors.\nWarriors: A few late alterations, with Isaiah Papali'i elevated to the starting lineup in the back-row and Adam Blair shifting to lock. Lachlan Burr drops to the bench and Gerard Beale moves from the reserves to the bench. Blake Ayshford and Liligiifo Sao were cut an hour before kick-off, while Chanel Harris-Tavita and Karl Lawton dropped out of the squad on Friday.\nSea Eagles: Manly will take to the field as named on Tuesday. Sea Eagles fans will be delighted to see fullback Tom Trbojevic back from an ankle injury, while prop Addin Fonua-Blake returns from suspension for Toafofoa Sipley, who moves to the bench. Brendan Elliot and Kelepi Tanginoa were the last players cut prior to kick-off, while Trent Hodkinson and Lloyd Perrett dropped out of the squad on Friday.\nKey match-up\nCherry-Evans and Blake Green were teammates at Manly before Green moved on to the Warriors. Both players have a lot on their plate every week for their teams to be successful but that comes with the territory of being starting playmakers in the NRL. Their respective contributions on Saturday are crucial to the outcome.\nFor the Sea Eagles to win\nThey can't have a repeat of last week when the game was effectively over at half-time. The forwards need to assert themselves against the hot and cold Warriors pack, while Cherry-Evans and Kane Elgey need to step up and take control.\nFor the Warriors to win\nWhen the Warriors cut the Tigers' lead to 12-6 early in the second half it looked as the game could've gone either way. But the Tigers turned up the heat and the visitors didn't have it in them to fight on. An 80-minute effort is vital on Saturday and they need their experienced leaders to take charge.\nBrett Kimmorley says ...\nI\u2019m not too sure where Manly can go on the back of being blown off the park last week and being poor in week one. They really need a good first 40 minutes When you are down on cattle you need to start well, lead, and then go from there. The Warriors would have their pride hurt after last week. With this game being in Christchurch there will be a lot of emotion, that will mean a lot. The game has to be played between the ears, that is the biggest deficiency for the Warriors. Warriors by 8\nSea Eagles Stat Attack\nCurtis Sironen is equal-second in the NRL in off-loads (7), while Apisai Koroisau has been busy in defence with 93 tackles (equal-second). On the down side Cherry-Evans is equal-second in handling errors (4).\nWarriors Stat Attack\nMistakes and poor options hurt the Warriors in the 34-6 loss to the Tigers. They completed just 67% (22/33) of their sets and had 14 errors - twice as many as the Tigers.\nAnd another thing ...\nIt's fair to say Blake Green is a rugby league journeyman, but the 32-year-old playmaker has carved out a very respectable career. Green is with his sixth NRL club and also had stints with two English Super League clubs. He played with the Sea Eagles in 2017 and would love to get a win over his former teammates."

            "AT&T, previously a joint minority owner of digital media portfolio company Otter Media, has purchased the venture\u2019s remaining shares from partner The Chernin Group in a deal reportedly worth more than $1 billion.\nThat price tag makes Otter one of the biggest digital media sales in recent years, notes The New York Times, which first reported the acquisition. Amazon acquired Twitch for $970 million in 2014, for instance, while Viacom just purchased AwesomenessTV for a bargain price of roughly $50 million.\nAT&T finalized in June its much-ballyhooed $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner \u2014 which owns HBO, Turner, and Warner Bros. (which in turn owns digital gaming network Machinima). Chernin Group founder Peter Chernin (pictured above) tells the Times that AT&T will likely fold Otter into this growing entertainment portfolio. AT&T has renamed Time Warner WarnerMedia, and the division will be led by CEO John Stankey \u2014 an AT&T veteran of three decades.\nSubscribe for daily Tubefilter Top Stories Subscribe\nOtter comprises niche streaming services like Crunchyroll, DramaFever, Fullscreen, Ellation, Rooster Teeth, and VRV \u2014 meaning that AT&T is now the full owner of each property. The Times reports that Otter\u2019s services count a combined 2 million paying subscribers. Otter, which itself purchased the remaining shares of Fullscreen and Ellation that it didn\u2019t already own in January. also holds stakes in Gunpowder & Sky and Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Hello Sunshine.\nAT&T\u2019s acquisition of Otter has been rumored as far back as last summer \u2014 though AT&T reportedly delayed the purchase last year after the Justice Department sought to block its Time Warner acquisition on antitrust grounds. A court ruled that AT&T could move forward with the acquisition in June, although the federal government has since appealed that ruling. Many have speculated that President Donald Trump is personally seeking to subvert the deal due to his hatred of Time Warner property CNN.\nTony Goncalves, an AT&T veteran who was named CEO of Otter Media in February \u2014 and who will report to Stankey \u2014 declined to comment on Otter\u2019s profitability. \u201cYou\u2019ll see a good amount of cross-pollination, where some of that really wonderful Warner intellectual property and content will find its way into the businesses that are part of the Otter portfolio today,\u201d Goncalves told the Times of Otter\u2019s integration into WarnerMedia.\nAs for Chernin\u2019s next steps, the Times reports that the noted media executive is currently looking to raise $500 million to invest in next-gen media companies. \u201cI think we will continue to do a version of what we do, which is make movies and television shows, and we will look to continue to invest in consumer technology brands,\u201d he told the paper."

            "The poop has well and truly hit the fan! Less than a day after a U.K. tabloid claimed that Johnny Depp, 55, allegedly accused his ex Amber Heard of leaving doo-doo in their bed, the actress is reeling from the gossip. The 32-year-old is said to be \u201cdisgusted\u201d by the story, which ran in the Daily Mirror on Aug. 15. According to the claims, Johnny allegedly accused his then wife Amber of deliberately leaving human poop in their bed to spite him for being late to her 30th birthday party in April 2016. Slamming the report, her rep told the newspaper that the blonde\u2019s dog, Boo, who has \u201cserious bowel control issues,\u201d was the culprit. Now we\u2019re learning exactly what the actress feels about the whole mess.\n\u201cAmber is just disgusted that Johnny would leak this stupid story to the press,\u201d a source close to the star EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife, while alleging that the actor was the source of the gossip. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that he\u2019s incapable of moving on even though they\u2019ve settled their divorce and she wants nothing more to do with him. Johnny is clearly still trying to humiliate and embarrass Amber, but she\u2019s over playing his games. Their marriage turned really toxic, and it\u2019s a time of her life that Amber wants to just put behind her for good. She wishes that Johnny would have the good grace to do the same.\u201d\nThe person adds, \u201cAmber vehemently denies pooping in their bed, even the idea of her doing that is utterly insane. It\u2019s just not something she would ever do. Johnny has been obsessed with the fact that it was Amber, ever since the incident happened, and he would never listen to reason, or believe Amber when she swore it wasn\u2019t her.\u201d\nAs fans of the Pirates Of the Caribbean star know, Amber and Johnny married in 2015, but divorced two years later after she publicly accused him of physically assaulting her \u2013 an allegation he denied. He clearly still has many loyal supporters out there, because \u2013 soon after the Mirror\u2019s poo-gate story was published \u2013 Amber\u2019s Instagram page was embarrassingly flooded with poop emojis. But will the reaction prompt her to delete her account?\nAnother insider tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY, \u201cAmber is so upset over the claims she pooped in Johnny\u2019s bed that she even considered quitting social media over it. She\u2019s seen the comments and emojis and they are very hurtful and since she is a very emotional person she is taking these attacks very hard.\u201d The person adds, \u201cIt really is throwing her emotions in a tailspin. She hates it but the only thing she can do is ride it out and hopefully for her benefit it will stop in the next few days.\u201d What a mess!"

            "The Chargers wildly ineffective veteran kicker, Caleb Sturgis, is apparently at risk of missing the week 6 contest against the Cleveland Browns. The team reportedly intends to deal with this problem by signing a second kicker to the active roster.\nWith veteran kicker Caleb Sturgis nursing a strained quad, the Chargers are signing free agent kicker Mike Badgley, league sources tell @FieldYates and me. Sturgis will not be cut, however, as the Chargers will carry two kickers on their active roster. \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) October 11, 2018\nMike Badgley has never attempted a field goal during a regular season NFL game. He played for the University of Miami during his college career and was mostly successful. He converted on 25 of 30 field goal attempts as a sophomore, 21 of 26 as a junior, and 17 of 23 as a senior. Those numbers are not impressive, but they are passable.\nOne hesitates to say they hope the Chargers do not need to use the rookie kicker because Sturgis has been so unreliable, but one hopes the Chargers do not need to rely on him this weekend. It is impossible to know what Badgley might do in his first taste of NFL experience, but hopefully, if he gets it with the Chargers, he will find success."

The record goal was appropriately scored against Atlanta United\u2019s biggest rival, Orlando City.\nThis record is just another on the list of accolades he has collected in MLS, with him already taking the top spot on for most hat tricks in MLS history. On top of all this, he still has eight-plus games left to play to add to his lead.\nTimes like these leave us a chance to remember how lucky we are to be able to watch a player of his quality on a week-to-week basis.

        "articles": [
            "HBO's limited series \"Sharp Objects\" uniquely features four songs from legendary 1970s rock and roll band, Led Zeppelin.\nThe show's music supervisor, Susan Jacobs, tells Business Insider about the months-long process to gain the rights to the music.\nFor decades, countless filmmakers have abandoned the hope of featuring the music of rock gods Led Zeppelin in their work because the legend is true: It\u2019s really, really hard to get the band to grant permission.\nBut Zeppelin continues to get requests because when the band does say \"yes,\" the scenes can become iconic. Amy Heckerling\u2019s 1982 classic \u201cFast Times at Ridgemont High\u201d famously got the band\u2019s okay to use \u201cKashmir\u201d in one scene (it might have helped that the movie\u2019s screenwriter, Cameron Crowe, used to cover the band for Rolling Stone). Recently, Adam McKay\u2019s \u201cThe Big Short\u201d was able to get \u201cWhen the Levee Breaks\u201d in its trailer and the movie\u2019s end credits.\nBecause Zeppelin needle drops are so hard to come by, it makes the incredible use of the band\u2019s music on the HBO limited series \u201cSharp Objects\u201d so special. And you can thank the show's veteran music supervisor Susan Jacobs for pulling it off.\nJacobs is no stranger to clearing Zeppelin. She did it for two David O. Russell movies (\u201cThe Fighter\u201d and \u201cSilver Linings Playbook\u201d) before her latest collaboration with \u201cSharp Objects\u201d director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e (\u201cBig Little Lies\u201d). But just because she did it before didn\u2019t mean getting the songs for the show was easy.\nLed Zeppelin. Warner Bros.\nSimply put: \u201cYou never go into Led Zeppelin assuming you\u2019re getting Led Zeppelin,\u201d Jacobs said.\nBased on Gillian Flynn\u2019s debut novel, \u201cSharp Objects\u201d follows newspaper journalist Camille Preaker (played by Amy Adams) who returns to her hometown to report on a series of murders. However, the assignment brings memories of her troubled past, and matched with her dependency to alcohol, it leads her into a tailspin.\nVall\u00e9e uses moody Zeppelin songs \u201cIn the Evening,\u201d \u201cWhat Is And What Should Never Be,\u201d \u201cThank You,\u201d and \u201cI Can\u2019t Quit You, Baby\u201d as a way to delve into Camille\u2019s psyche, but the songs are also her escape hatch when things are getting too out of hand, as she plays the music constantly through a beat-up iPhone.\nThe use of Zeppelin is one of the biggest additions Vall\u00e9e made to his adaptation of Flynn\u2019s novel, as the band is not mentioned at all in the book. However, the unique guitar sounds of Jimmy Page and howls of Robert Plant feel essential to the story.\nJacobs said that was the intention Vall\u00e9e had when he asked her to try to clear Zeppelin long before production began on \u201cSharp Objects\u201d (typically music supervisors begin working on movies and TV shows toward the end of production or the start of post production). He wanted the band specifically because Camille\u2019s story needed an epic sound.\n\u201cIt had to be a band very substantial to be felt across generations,\u201d Jacobs told Business Insider. \u201cIt had to have that depth and honesty.\u201d\nNo begging and pleading allowed\nJacobs has been working with Vall\u00e9e since his 2014 movie \u201cWild,\u201d and his love for meaty soundtracks in his work has only become more refined since, as evident in his previous HBO project, the 8-time Emmy-winning \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d (Jacobs won an Emmy for music supervision on the show). So she knew that Vall\u00e9e\u2019s Zeppelin ask clearly wasn\u2019t just to play a song or two in the background of scenes. And that led to the first hurdle for Jacobs: how to start the conversation with Warner/Chappel, the publisher of the band\u2019s songs.\n\u201cCrafting the pitch for me can be three weeks of solid trying to write the right letter,\u201d she said.\nA music supervisor\u2019s role in trying to get music rights is partly keeping the filmmaker happy, but also the music publishers and artists. Jacobs called herself a \u201cmarriage broker\u201d in the experience.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s about putting in a lot of time and making really clear what you are asking for and why you\u2019re asking for it, why is that song important?\u201d she said.\nSusan Jacobs. Getty\nAnd with Zeppelin it took months to pull off.\nJacobs said there were numerous pitches, which stated some specifics of what \u201cSharp Objects\u201d was about and listing the key cast and director involved, as well as the songs they wanted (which were the ones that ended up in the show). And it wasn\u2019t just one, she had to send pitches for each level of approvals she got through. After that, it became a waiting game.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t begging and pleading and banging on the doors, it took a long time,\u201d said Jacobs, who declined to divulge how much it cost to clear the songs.\nJacobs said one of the big keys was that she was dealing with someone on the publishing side who knew Vall\u00e9e\u2019s work. Wendy Christiansen, the senior VP of film and TV music at Warner/Chappel, had direct contact with the band and made them understand that the music would be in good hands. Vall\u00e9e and Jacobs needed a voice like that because there was nothing to show the band of how the music would be used.\nJacobs had started the talks so early on that much of the negotiations were going on during preproduction and the shooting of the show. It wasn\u2019t until the editing of the episodes began that Zeppelin finally agreed to clear the songs.\nUsing Zeppelin to guide someone in pain\nJacobs said there are 23 uses of the four Led Zeppelin songs in \u201cSharp Objects,\u201d but you\u2019d have to have a good ear to catch them all.\nIn some episodes there may be a faint three-second sampling of a single song, in others there may be a few verses of multiple songs throughout. Vall\u00e9e made Zeppelin almost another character in the story.\nAccording to Jacobs, Vall\u00e9e wanted Zeppelin in the show because the band\u2019s music got him through the tough times of his youth. He felt many watching the show would relate.\n\u201cI can think of hundreds of others who I can put in a room and say the same thing,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cFor many of us, our teen years, without Led Zeppelin those years would have been a whole lot rougher.\u201d\nAnd as we learned in the \u201cFix\u201d episode, the band\u2019s music became an important part of Camille\u2019s life in one of her low points. In flashback scenes, we learn that Camille went to rehab before going back to her hometown at the start of the series. There she became friends with her roommate Alice, who constantly played Zeppelin songs on her phone. Like Alice, Zeppelin became Camille\u2019s escape from the world. At the end of the episode, Camille discovers Alice\u2019s body after she has committed suicide. Camille moves forward with her life with the help of the Zeppelin songs Alice introduced to her. The songs would become as prevalent to her as the scars we see all over her body as the show evolves.\n(L-R) Alice (Sydney Sweeney) and Camille (Amy Adams) in the \"Fix\" episode of \"Sharp Objects.\" Anne Maris Fox/HBO\nJacobs said she never explained in her pitches to Zeppelin the way Vall\u00e9e would use their music, though she did hint that the music would play a big part in the life of a character who is dealing with a lot of pain.\n\u201cThey were on board with that,\u201d she said. \u201cThey really understood the role music has in the guiding of someone who is in trouble.\u201d\nBut what would have happened if Zeppelin didn\u2019t give permission for the music to be used?\nJacobs said they would have had to move on to another substantial band, perhaps The Rolling Stones, she said. But she admits she and Vall\u00e9e never had to have a serious talk about a plan B.\nThough Jacobs has once again been successful in getting Zeppelin for a project, she admitted there\u2019s still so much mystery every time she attempts it. She said she has no relationship with the band, in fact, she has no idea if the band members have seen \u201cSharp Objects,\u201d or any of the movies where she\u2019s used their music.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t really asked and they aren\u2019t ones to say,\u201d Jacobs said with a laugh. \u201cJimmy [Page] lives off the grid, whether he\u2019s got a TV set or whether he cares I don\u2019t know. But I do think they care about young people being exposed to their music, and this did that.\u201d\n\u201cSharp Objects\u201d airs Sundays on HBO."

She was last seen walking with an unidentified Asian woman and then getting into white Infinity with New York license plates, according to police.\nMa was last seen in Washington wearing blue jeans, a white T-shirt and a black jacket, according to police.\nFootage from a surveillance video shows JinJing Ma and the female suspect walking through the baggage/arrivals level of the airport. MWAA\nA different man, wearing all black, was also seen in a surveillance photo at the airport with the woman believed to have taken Ma. It is still not known what connection, if any, the man had with Ma.\nMa was part of a student tour group that has been in the U.S. visiting schools and sightseeing since July 26. The group arrived in D.C. from New York Thursday and was supposed to travel to the west coast before heading back to China, said David Huckler, the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority chief of police.\nBefore arriving in Washington, a couple approached Ma while visiting the World Trade Center grounds in New York. Authorities said there was some familiarity between Ma and the couple, and believe that there is a connection to the man and women captured on airport surveillance cameras, Huckler said.\nA witness reportedly told police that he may have seen the unidentified woman meet up with Ma in New York and give her food. It is not clear if the woman was a part of the same tour group as Ma, according to NBC affiliate NBC4 Washington.\nIt remains unclear if the couple that approached Ma in New York or the unknown woman from a witness's account are related to the young girl.\nThe investigation is now being led by the FBI, the statement read."

Corey Conners is relishing the chance to play at the Masters after winning at the Valero Texas Open.\nCorey Conners claimed his maiden PGA Tour title and secured a place in the Masters with a two-shot victory at the Valero Texas Open.\nFinal leaderboard Valero Texas Open\nThe 27-year-old Canadian fired a six-under 66 for the second day running to finish on 20-under 268 after a rollercoaster of a final round at TPC San Antonio.\nConners, who also became just the fifth Monday qualifier to win a PGA Tour event, had just four pars on his card as he repelled the strong challenges of American duo Charley Hoffman and Ryan Moore.\nSi Woo Kim, who was looking to complete a wire-to-wire victory after leading for the first three rounds, had to settle for joint-fourth place after a level-par 72 on a day when an overnight storm, which delayed the start of play by two hours, led to some low scoring in the rain-softened conditions.\nWorld No 196 Conners started the day one behind Kim but he leapt into a two-shot lead after making his second birdie at the third as the South Korean made a double-bogey.\nSome excellent iron play then saw a calm and confident Conners add further birdies at the fourth and fifth to open up a four-shot advantage at the top of the leaderboard.\nBut his round then took a dramatic turn downhill as he bogeyed the next four holes due to a number of untidy shots, his fourth dropped shot at the ninth handing Hoffman a one-shot lead.\nConners is the first Monday qualifier to win on the PGA Tour since Arjun Atwal in 2010\nConners was back on an upward curve at the 10th after a superb approach shot gave him a tap-in birdie and he followed that up with two more gains after a fine second shot at the 11th and a lengthy holed putt at the 12th.\nHe remained on track with a birdie at the 14th after getting up and down from a greenside bunker and, after holing a clutch 12-footer for par at the 15th, he notched another birdie at the par-three 16th where he nearly took out the flag with his tee shot.\nThere was no sign of nerves as he confidently birdied the 17th - the 10th birdie of his round - to go three clear and he safely parred the last to wrap up the victory.\n\"I've been close a few times and feel like I've learned a lot in those situations and that really helped today,\" said Conners, the 15th Canadian to win on the PGA Tour.\nConners proudly displays the Valero Texas Open trophy\n\"I couldn't be more excited to get over the edge. There's so many perks that come with it.\n\"Got off to a great start, birdied number five and walked to sixth tee thinking, 'wow, this is really awesome' and then reeled off four bogeys.\n\"I didn't get too down on myself. I knew I was playing really well. It was nice to have a little break between nine and 10 and give myself a bit of a pep talk.\"\nCharley Hoffman will head to the Masters in good form\nHoffman played flawless golf with five birdies in his 67, the last of them at the 18th securing him second place on 18 under.\nMoore, who was six off the lead overnight, made a storming start with birdies at the first and fourth and an eagle at the second before continuing his charge with four birdies in five holes from the 12th to briefly take a share of the lead.\nRyan Moore made a bold attempt to claim his sixth PGA Tour crown\nHowever, he could only par the final two holes as he signed for an eight-under 64 which left him in third place on 17 under.\nKim, appeared to be struggling a little with a rib injury in the closing stages but he still had three birdies in four holes from the 14th after his earlier troubles before bogeying the 18th.\nSi Woo Kim failed to make it a wire-to-wire success\nAmerican Brian Stuard carded a 66 to share fourth place with Kim on 15 under, one ahead of compatriot Kevin Streelman, who briefly held a share of the lead on 15 under when he made a fourth successive birdie at the 17th before he bogeyed the last to sign for a 64.\nNorthern Ireland's Graeme McDowell continued his return to form as he closed with a six-under 66 to secure a share of seventh place.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Graeme McDowell is looking forward to the rest of the season after closing with a six-under 66 at the Valero Texas Open Graeme McDowell is looking forward to the rest of the season after closing with a six-under 66 at the Valero Texas Open\nRickie Fowler will head to the Masters after carding a 69 to tie for 17th place on 10 under, while Jordan Spieth will have been hoping for something better than a level-par 72, which left him tied for 31st on seven under, before travelling to Augusta National."

            "Capitals fans outside the Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., react to a goal during Thursday's Game 5. (Ricky Carioti / The Washington Post)\nMaybe you knew when the Washington Capitals defeated their longtime playoff nemesis, the Pittsburgh Penguins, that the Stanley Cup would end up in D.C. and you could start planning the victory parade.\nBut now that it\u2019s here, there\u2019s a lot you need to consider. This will be the first championship parade for Washington sports since the Redskins captured the Super Bowl 26 years ago, and D.C. will be even more difficult to navigate than usual.\nAdvertisement\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know to get to and enjoy the Capitals parade:\nWhen is the parade, and where?\nAdvertisement\nOn Tuesday, the parade will start at 11 a.m. at the corner of Constitution Avenue and 17th Street, between the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the Washington Monument, and will roll down Constitution Ave toward 7th Street, at the National Mall.\nHow do I get down there?\nTake the MARC. The train will run on its regular weekday schedule on all three lines Tuesday. There will also be a limited additional capacity on the 9 a.m. southbound Penn Line Train 423 and the 1:20 and 2:20 p.m. northbound Penn Line trains 422 and 424.\nBuy your tickets early, but keep in mind that a ticket does not mean a spot on the train.\nMake sure you get to Baltimore\u2019s Penn Station with plenty of time before your departure. MARC is expecting far more people than usual (likely all wearing red) and the trains will be extremely crowded. Officials say they will cut off boarding when they feel that the car is too full.\nBuy your tickets, or look at the train schedules here: mta.maryland.gov/marc-train\nIf you want to run on your own schedule via your car, driving down will be slow. There will likely be traffic all Tuesday morning, so leave early if you can (before 6 a.m. rush hour). Here are some routes to carry you from Baltimore:\nTravel on MD-295 S, and then merge onto the Baltimore-Washington Parkway into D.C.\nTake I-95 S and Baltimore-Washington Parkway to the US-50 W exit.\nWhat will the weather be like?\nAdvertisement\nPerfect, according to the forecast. Monday\u2019s gloomy clouds and chilly rain will disappear, to be replaced by a partly cloudy sky, warm 78 degree temperature, just 57 percent humidity and a light breeze. Of course, even if it were raining, Alex Ovechkin\u2019s already pretty used to celebrating in water \u2026\nThis is the kind of stuff that you tell your grandchildren you were alive to see. #Ovechkin\npic.twitter.com/zT6axuWjy6 \u2014 Paul Almeida (@AzorcanGlobal) June 9, 2018\nHow many people are supposed to be there?\nWhen Ted Leonsis\u2019 company, Monumental Sports & Entertainment, applied to the National Park Service for the parade Thursday morning, it officially anticipated \u201c100,000+\u201d to show up. But on the ice Thursday night, Leonsis told reporters, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be much bigger than everyone is expecting.\u201d\nDo I need some kind of ticket to get close to the street?\nUnlike the Capitals\u2019 viewing party last week, you don\u2019t need a ticket. The parade is free and open to the public. But unless you\u2019re camped out by 6 a.m. at the latest, you\u2019re probably not going to beat out D.C.\u2019s own to grab the best view of the route.\nIf I do drive down, where can I park?\nAdvertisement\nThe bad news is that it\u2019s very unlikely you\u2019ll find good parking, especially the closer and closer it gets to 11 a.m.\nStreet parking is also a familiarly hellish experience to most Washington residents. Most spots will be metered at $2.30 an hour, which will add a time restriction to fans who might just want to enjoy the day and relax without having to worry about rushing back to the car.\nThere are also several parking lots around Franklin Square (about four blocks to the parade route), but it will cost you on average about $23.\nThere will also be a large number of parking restrictions:\n7 th Street will be Emergency No Parking from 6:30 p.m. Monday through 11 p.m. Tuesday from Independence Avenue SW to Pennsylvania Avenue NW.\nStreet will be Emergency No Parking from 6:30 p.m. Monday through 11 p.m. Tuesday from Independence Avenue SW to Pennsylvania Avenue NW. 7th Street will be closed from Independence Avenue SW to Constitution Avenue NW from 6:30 p.m. on Monday through 11 p.m. Tuesday as well.\nThe following restrictions will are classified as Emergency No Parking from 6:30 p.m. on Monday through 3:30 p.m. Tuesday:\nConstitution Avenue, NW from 6 th Street to 23 rd Street NW\nStreet to 23 Street NW 9 th Street NW from Pennsylvania Avenue NW to I-395\nStreet NW from Pennsylvania Avenue NW to I-395 10 th Street NW from Pennsylvania Avenue NW to Constitution Avenue NW\nStreet NW from Pennsylvania Avenue NW to Constitution Avenue NW 12 th Street NW from Pennsylvania Avenue NW to Constitution Avenue NW\nStreet NW from Pennsylvania Avenue NW to Constitution Avenue NW 14th Street from Pennsylvania Avenue NW to Independence Avenue SW\n15th Street from Pennsylvania Avenue NW to Independence Avenue SW\n17th Street from Pennsylvania Avenue NW to Independence Avenue SW\n18th Street from New York Avenue NW to Constitution Avenue NW\n19th Street from Virginia Avenue NW to Constitution Avenue NW\n20th Street form C Street NW to Constitution Avenue NW\n21st Street from C Street NW to Constitution Avenue NW\n22nd Street from C Street NW to Constitution Avenue NW\n23rd Street from C Street NW to Constitution Avenue NW\nVirginia Avenue NW from 18th Street to 19th Street NW\nIndependence Avenue SW from 3rd to 14th Street SW\nMadison Drive from 4th to 15th Streets NW\nJefferson Drive from 14th to 4th Streets SW\nHenry Bacon Drive SW from Lincoln Memorial Circle to Constitution Avenue NW\nParkway Drive SW from Independence Avenue to Lincoln Memorial Circle\nExpand Autoplay Image 1 of 45 The Capitals' Alex Ovechkin hoists the Stanley Cup after the Capitals defeated the Golden Knights in Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Final on Thursday, June 7, 2018, in Las Vegas. (John Locher / AP)\nWhen I\u2019m not standing along the parade route, how do I get around?\nAdvertisement\nIf you\u2019re able-bodied, walking is your best bet. Take the Metro, if you can. Rush hour service will be provided all day to accomodate the influx of people.Trains will depart every 2 to 4 minutes around downtown stops.\nI\u2019m tired, a person with a physical disability or I have small children that don\u2019t want to walk anymore \u2014 how easy will it be for a taxi or rideshare service to get us around?\nNot bad, but not great. Because of the high demand, Uber rates will undoubtedly increase by approximately 1.8x or 2.5x, so at the very worst, a $10 ride will turn into a $25 ride, according to the rideshare\u2019s website.\nThere will also be a very large number of street closures.\nThe following streets will be closed from 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, June 12 through 3:00 p.m. on Tuesday, June 12:\nInbound 14 th Street Bridge Main Line - all traffic will be directed toward Eastbound I-395\nStreet Bridge Main Line - all traffic will be directed toward Eastbound I-395 Inbound 14th Street Bridge HOV - all traffic will be directed toward Eastbound I-395\nNorthbound 12th Street Tunnel - all traffic will be directed toward Eastbound I-395\nEastbound Theodore Roosevelt Bridge - all traffic will be directed toward E Street Expressway/Potomac River Freeway\nSouthbound 9th Street Tunnel\nConstitution Avenue, NW from 6th Street to 23rd Street, NW\n9th Street, NW from Pennsylvania Avenue, NW to I-395\n10th Street, NW from Pennsylvania Avenue, NW to Constitution Avenue, NW\n12th Street, NW from Pennsylvania Avenue, NW to Constitution Avenue, NW\n14th Street from Pennsylvania Avenue, NW to Independence Avenue, SW\n15th Street from Pennsylvania Avenue, NW to Independence Avenue, SW\n17th Street from Pennsylvania Avenue, NW to Independence Avenue, SW\n18th Street from New York Avenue, NW to Constitution Avenue, NW\n19th Street from Virginia Avenue, NW to Constitution Avenue, NW\n20th Street form C Street, NW to Constitution Avenue, NW\n21st Street from C Street, NW to Constitution Avenue, NW\n22nd Street from C Street, NW to Constitution Avenue, NW\n23rd Street from Virginia Avenue, NW to Constitution Avenue, NW\nVirginia Avenue, NW from 18th Street to 19th Street, NW\nMadison Drive from 4th to 15th Streets, NW\nJefferson Drive from 14th to 4th Streets, SW\nHenry Bacon Drive, SW from Lincoln Memorial Circle to Constitution Avenue, NW\nParkway Drive, SW from Independence Avenue, to Lincoln Memorial Circle\nWhat\u2019s going on at the National Mall?\nAdvertisement\nAn ALLCAPS rally.

        "articles": [
            "The Dragon Prince Season 2 is out now on Netflix. Have you watched both seasons? What do you think of the improved animation quality? Which characters are your favorite? Let us know in the comments below, and read on for our review!\nThe Dragon Prince is a show that started strong, but left a lot to be desired given the short length of its first season. It introduced an intriguing world and some fun characters, but spent so much time establishing its lore that the plot took a back seat until the last few episodes. Season 2 turns out to be much the same: Once again, after a slow, but promising start, The Dragon Prince seems like it will finally start gaining some momentum--next season, that is.\nWhen we last saw Prince Callum, Prince Ezran, and the elven assassin Reyla, they were on the run from the kingdom of Katolis to return the magical dragon egg when it suddenly hatched. Hot on their trail were Claudia, a dark magic user, and Soren, her bone-headed brother who intended on returning the two princes back home against their will. It was an action-packed finale to what was otherwise a slow burn of a first season, and while Season 2 picks up immediately after, it feels like the show immediately hits the brakes, focusing on establishing character motivations as opposed to pushing the plot forward.\nWhile that\u2019s certainly a disappointment, it\u2019s not such a bad thing this time around. With another set of nine episodes focused on more buildup, almost every character was given a chance to begin a unique arc for themselves. Callum, for example, dealing with the repercussions of breaking the Primal stone, cannot cast magic anymore and struggles with whether or not he\u2019ll turn to the dark arts to compensate. Ezran, a child himself, must act as the main guardian of the recently hatched dragon, Zym, while he reels from the news that he is next in line to become king. They don\u2019t make too many strides forward in their quest to bring Zym back to his mother, but they make up for it with character growth that sets up their goals and challenges for the seasons to come.\nExtra attention was even given to some of the side characters as well, in particular the siblings, Claudia and Soren, who were tasked with tracking down the two princes last season. We spend a good amount of episodes with them, which is fantastic because their chemistry together rivals that of the main characters. Soren is still as burly and brash as ever, but time is taken to show us a bit more about what drives him to be the best, while Claudia begins to face the repercussions of her proclivity with dark magic. Viren, the main antagonist of the series so far, also gets mixed up in his own side story, showing us his insecurities and reasons for wanting to go to war with the elves. There\u2019s some disturbing implications that come with it, and considering the season begins with Aunt Amaya literally smacking two elves into a pit of lava, I can\u2019t wait to see if the show will continue to get darker.\nOne highly requested (and much needed) change to The Dragon Prince was adding more frames of animation to its quieter, dialogue focused scenes. While it could still use some work, I\u2019m happy to say that there isn\u2019t one scene this time around that reminded me of the sometimes borderline stop-motion animation that plagued the first season. Fight scenes are still as exciting and creatively choreographed as ever, and just like last season, scenes of serenity give us some beautiful vistas showcasing the lush world these characters inhabit. Just like the first season, it wasn\u2019t uncommon for me to pause the show and just stare at some of the visuals. Its sense of humor is still very much intact as well, occasionally catching me off guard with that trademark Avatar: The Last Airbender-esque humor.\nThere are a couple of issues lingering on from the first season that continue to hold the show back, however. Ezran is still an extremely underdeveloped character. He\u2019s given more to do this season, which helps, but he\u2019s still criminally underused as one of the show\u2019s three main characters. His contributions to conversations usually amount to no more than naivete as a form of comic relief, and don\u2019t give any insight into his feelings until the last episode. That grievance can be amplified by some of actor Sasha Rojen\u2019s dialogue delivery as well, which sometimes comes off as flat. On that same note, Reyla, who arguably experienced the most growth in Season 1, was given very little to do this time around. She gets into all the fights and can clash with the best of them, but we already knew that about her. While I can respect that her spotlight was taken away to give other characters a chance to shine, it\u2019s a shame the only thing we learn about her this season is that she\u2019s working on overcoming her aversion to boats.\nWhile there have been missteps here and there while The Dragon Prince begins its journey, I can\u2019t fault it too much this time around considering the amount of care the writers are putting into each character. When the first season ended, I wasn\u2019t sure whether or not I would be excited to continue watching because it wasn\u2019t quite enough to get me fully invested. While I\u2019m still patiently waiting to see where the story takes the characters, I can\u2019t wait to see where the characters will take the story. Yes, it\u2019s disappointing that the characters have barely gotten any closer to completing their goal, but the quality time we spent with them this season was anything but filler. With battle lines being drawn and allegiances tested, everything is poised to fan the flames of the plot. It still hasn\u2019t taken off quite yet, but when The Dragon Prince returns, I\u2019m confident it will soar."

            "A diver in South Africa survived an experience out of a biblical passage last month when he ended up almost being swallowed by a whale.\nRainer Schimpf, 51, was snorkeling off the coast of Port Elizabeth, South Africa, when he ended up in the path of a Bryde's whale, which opened his jaws and engulfed him headfirst.\n\"We were very astonished that out of nowhere this whale came up,\" he told Sky News. \"I was busy concentrating on the sharks because you want to know if the shark is in front of you or behind you, left or right, so we were very focused on the sharks and their behavior -- then suddenly it got dark.\"\nNEW ORCA SPECIES DISCOVERED? SCIENTISTS SPOT MYSTERIOUS KILLER WHALES\nSchimpf, who has worked as a dive operator for over 15 years, said he was in the water with two others for just a matter of minutes before the whale appeared. He had happened to be with a group recording a sardine run, which is where marine animals such as dolphins, whales, and sharks gather fish into bait balls.\nThe 51-year-old said once the whale grabbed him, he felt pressure around his body but soon realized he was too big for the whale to swallow him whole which was \"kind of an instant relief.\"\n\"So my next thought was that the whale may take me down into the ocean and release me further down, so I instantly held my breath,\" he told Sky News. \"Obviously he realized I was not what he wanted to eat so he spat me out again.\"\nUnlike the biblical story of Jonah, Schimpf didn't end up in the animal's belly but was able to swim away after being released.\nOVER 80 PEOPLE INJURED AFTER JAPANESE FERRY COLLIDES WITH WHALE\nBryde's whales are members of the baleen whale family, a group that includes blue whales and humpback whales, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\"Bryde\u2019s whales are named for Johan Bryde, a Norwegian who built the first whaling stations in South Africa in the early 20th century,\" the agency says. \"Bryde\u2019s whales are found in warm, temperate oceans including the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific.\"\nThe whales can weigh about 90,000 pounds and grow to a length of 55 feet, according to the NOAA. The whales have a diet that consists mainly of krill, red crabs, shrimp and a \"variety of schooling fishes,\" but clearly not adult humans.\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\nSchimpf said the whole experience showed him just how small humans are in the world.\n\"Once you're grabbed by something that's 15 tons heavy and very fast in the water, you realize you're actually only that small in the middle of the ocean,\" he told Sky News."

            "The Supreme Court has upheld President Trump's travel ban Tuesday. With a 5-4 vote, the court wrote in its opinion that the order is \"squarely within the scope of Presidential authority.\"\nThe 5-4 decision Tuesday is the court's first substantive ruling on a Trump administration policy. The president reacted to news of the ruling, tweeting \"Wow!\"\nSUPREME COURT UPHOLDS TRUMP TRAVEL BAN. Wow! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2018\nMr. Trump later hailed the ruling as a \"tremendous victory for the American People and the Constitution.\"\nIn a statement issued by the White House, he said, \"This ruling is also a moment of profound vindication following months of hysterical commentary from the media and Democratic politicians who refuse to do what it takes to secure our border and our country. As long as I am President, I will defend the sovereignty, safety, and security of the American People, and fight for an immigration system that serves the national interests of the United States and its citizens.\"\nMeanwhile, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the ruling was \"critical to ensuring the continued authority of President Trump -- and all future presidents -- to protect the American people.\"\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion, joined by his four conservative colleagues. Roberts wrote that presidents have substantial power to regulate immigration. \"The sole prerequisite,\" Roberts wrote, is \"that the entry of the covered aliens 'would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.' The President has undoubtedly fulfilled that requirement here.\" Roberts pointed out that Mr. Trump had ordered an evaluation of every country's compliance with the risk assessment baseline and then issued the findings.\n\"Based on that review, he found that restricting entry of aliens who could not be vetted with adequate information was in the national interest,\" Roberts wrote.\nRoberts also rejected the challengers' claim of anti-Muslim bias. But he was careful not to endorse either Trump's provocative statements about immigration in general and Muslims in particular.\n\"We express no view on the soundness of the policy,\" Roberts wrote.\nHowever, CBS News' Jan Crawford cautioned on CBSN that it \"would be a mistake to read this ruling as, Trump can say whatever he wants.\" The next case, the next issue -- perhaps Russia -- is a different case, and he could make remarks that could show insight into a different area of law.\nThe court may have signaled its eventual approval in December, when the justices allowed the policy to take full effect even as the court fight continued and lower courts had ruled it out of bounds.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent that based on the evidence in the case \"a reasonable observer would conclude that the Proclamation was motivated by anti-Muslim animus.\" She said her colleagues arrived at the opposite result by \"ignoring the facts, misconstruing our legal precedent, and turning a blind eye to the pain and suffering the Proclamation inflicts upon countless families and individuals, many of whom are United States citizens.\"\nJustices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan also dissented.\nIn a tweet from the ACLU, the advocacy group said \"this is not the first time the Court has been wrong, or has allowed official racism and xenophobia to continue rather than standing up to it.\"\nThey added, \"History has its eyes on us -- and will judge today's decision harshly.\"\nBREAKING: SCOTUS has upheld Trump\u2019s Muslim ban. This is not the first time the Court has been wrong, or has allowed official racism and xenophobia to continue rather than standing up to it.\nHistory has its eyes on us \u2014 and will judge today\u2019s decision harshly. #NoMuslimBanEver \u2014 ACLU (@ACLU) June 26, 2018\nRyan Mace of Amnesty International USA said in a statement following the ruling that the policy is \"a catastrophe all around.\"\n\"Some of the people banned from this policy are fleeing conflicts that the United States has had a direct hand in creating or perpetuating, as is the case in Yemen and Syria. In those cases especially we are essentially lighting a house on fire and locking the escape door shut. This ban, and the anti-Muslim sentiment in which it originated, has no place in a country that claims to value human rights,\" Mace added.\nNihad Awad, Executive Director of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), said at a press conference that the Court's ruling was \"extremely disappointing\" to Muslims and \"all people who believe in equal protection and equality.\"\nAwad said the ruling now gives the Trump administration a \"free hand to re-inject discrimination against a particular faith back into our immigration system.\"\nCBS News\nRead the opinion here:\nTravel ban arguments\nIn April, Mr. Trump appeared likely to win his argument when the case was heard by the high court. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy both signaled support for the travel policy in arguments. The ban's challengers almost certainly needed one of those two justices in order to strike down the ban on travelers from several mostly Muslim countries.\nThe justices voted in December to allow the policy to take full effect pending their full consideration.\nThe Trump administration asked the court to reverse lower court rulings that would strike down the ban.\nThe Supreme Court also considered whether the president can indefinitely keep people out of the country based on nationality, and it also looked at whether the policy is aimed at excluding Muslims from the United States.\nKennedy challenged lawyer Neal Katyal, representing the challengers, about whether the ban would be unending. He said the policy's call for a report every six months \"indicates there'll be a reassessment\" from time to time.\nThe travel ban was the first Trump policy to undergo a full-blown Supreme Court review. The justices examined the third version of a policy that Mr. Trump first rolled out a week after taking office, triggering chaos and protests across the U.S. as travelers were stopped from boarding international flights and detained at airports for hours. The first version was blocked by courts and withdrawn. Its replacement was allowed to take partial effect, but expired in September.\nThe current version is indefinite and now applies to travelers from five countries with overwhelmingly Muslim populations \u2014 Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. It also affects two non-Muslim countries, blocking travelers from North Korea and some Venezuelan government officials and their families. A sixth majority-Muslim country, Chad, was removed from the list in April after improving \"its identity-management and information sharing practices,\" Mr. Trump said in a proclamation.\nThe administration argued that courts have no role to play because the president has broad powers over immigration and national security, and foreigners have no right to enter the country.\nThe challengers argued that his policy amounts to the Muslim ban that Mr. Trump called for as a candidate, violating the Constitution's prohibition against religious bias."

            "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose mastery of social media has helped drive the national conversation and shed light on the inner workings of congressional power, has given up on the most popular social network in the world. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight In an interview Sunday with the Yahoo News podcast \u201cSkullduggery,\u201d the New York Democrat said she stopped using her Facebook account and was scaling back on all social media, which she described as a \u201cpublic health risk\u201d because it can lead to \u201cincreased isolation, depression, anxiety, addiction, escapism.\u201d\nOcasio-Cortez, 29, who burst onto the national stage after defeating a high-ranking incumbent, said her departure from Facebook was a \u201cbig deal\u201d because the platform had been crucial to her campaign. She still has accounts on the site, she said, and according to the company\u2019s ad library, her official Facebook account has dozens of active advertisements sponsored by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for Congress. Among the ads are calls to support her signature Green New Deal, and fundraising pleas to support progressive legislation and to counteract a super PAC aligned against her.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe congresswoman\u2019s words speak for themselves,\u201d said Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez.\nOcasio-Cortez joins other prominent users who have given up on the social network, including WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, who sold his company to Facebook in 2014, and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Both technologists parted ways with the social network amid a user boycott and as the company faced a congressional inquiry over the Cambridge Analytica controversy, when it was revealed that the political firm had improperly obtained personal information from millions of Facebook users.\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s disengagement from Facebook also tracks broad trends in social media use among young people. According to a 2018 Pew Research Center study, Facebook\u2019s popularity among teens has plunged in recent years. Roughly half of the nation\u2019s teenagers say they use Facebook, compared with 71 percent in 2015.\nThe hashtag #deletefacebook is trending on Twitter after Facebook's Cambridge Analytica controversy. Here's a guide on how to leave the social media site. (Video: Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post, Photo: Kathleen Rudell-Brooks/The Washington Post)\nYouTube, Instagram and Snapchat have now overtaken Facebook as the most popular social media networks, the study found.\nAdvertisement\nAfter a rolling series of scandals involving the misuse of personal data, hateful content and misinformation, many Facebook users have also changed the way they use the platform. A separate Pew Research survey found that 74 percent of U.S. adult Facebook users have done one of the following: changed their privacy settings, taken a break from the platform or deleted it.\nDespite Facebook\u2019s troubles, the social network has recently gained daily active users in the U.S. and Canada, according to the company\u2019s most recent earnings report. Prior to the last quarter of 2018, Facebook\u2019s user numbers in its most important market had flatlined, with most of its growth coming from countries outside of North America and Europe. Facebook counted 1.52 billion daily users, on average, an increase of 9 percent from the end of 2017.\nThe figures suggest that some of the people who abandoned the platform have returned and that the company is still attracting new users.\nAdvertisement\nThough the company continues to post strong returns, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg continues to find himself under scrutiny. Last year, he was called to testify before Congress, enduring 10 hours of questioning tied to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. And it\u2019s currently negotiating a multibillion-dollar fine with the Federal Trade Commission to settle the agency\u2019s investigation into its privacy practices.\nMeanwhile, European regulators have criticized Zuckerberg\u2019s new plan to merge the company\u2019s messaging platforms \u2014 Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger \u2014 citing antitrust concerns.\nDuring her podcast interview, Ocasio-Cortez pointed to negative health consequences as a reason to scale back on social platforms.\n\u201cI actually think that social media poses a public health risk to everybody,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are amplified impacts for young people, particularly children under the age of 3 with screen time. But I think it has a lot of effects on older people. I think it has effects on everybody. Increased isolation, depression, anxiety, addiction, escapism.\u201d\nOcasio-Cortez, who writes all of her own tweets and Instagram posts, said she\u2019s trying to limit her consumption of social media to the workweek. \u201cLike every once in a while, you\u2019ll see me hop on Twitter on the weekends, but for the most part, I take consumption of content, when it comes to consumption and reading, I take the weekends off.\u201d\nGiftOutline Gift Article"

            "Has the queen found her king?

The twosome were also seen embracing as they posed for photos on the carpet.\nLast month, during her appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Minaj teased that she\u2019s seeing someone.\n\u201cWell, there was a new boy but he and I kind of fell back a little bit. And then there\u2019s a newer, yeah, fairly new.

Multiple sources told Us Weekly that the \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d rapper, 25, threw her shoe at Minaj before Love & Hip Hop\u2019s Rah Ali interjected. One eyewitness told Us that Minaj was favoriting social media posts criticizing Cardi\u2019s parenting of daughter Kulture, which prompted the \u201cI Like It\u201d singer to confront the \u201cBarbie Tingz\u201d rapper.\nMinaj spoke out about the incident on Monday\u2019s episode of her Beats 1 show, Queen Radio, and denied criticizing Cardi\u2019s mothering abilities. \u201cI wanna say that I would never discuss anyone\u2019s child \u2026 I would never talk about anyone\u2019s child or parenting,\u201d she urged. \u201cIt\u2019s so crazy to me that people always need to make [me] the bad guy.

No place for last season\u2019s star Maynak Markande. Ben Cutting, Kieron Pollard, Quinton de Kock and Mitchell McLenaghan made the four foreigners for Mumbai. Delhi have opted for Colin Ingram, Keemo Paul, Kagiso Rabada and Trent Boult as their four foreigners.\nMumbai Indians (Playing XI): Rohit Sharma(c), Quinton de Kock(w), Suryakumar Yadav, Krunal Pandya, Yuvraj Singh, Kieron Pollard, Hardik Pandya, Ben Cutting, Mitchell McClenaghan, Rasikh Salam, Jasprit Bumrah\nDelhi Capitals (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Prithvi Shaw, Shreyas Iyer(c), Rishabh Pant(w), Colin Ingram, Keemo Paul, Axar Patel, Rahul Tewatia, Kagiso Rabada, Trent Boult, Ishant Sharma\nPreivew\nThe last time Mumbai played Delhi in the Indian T20 League, the three-time champions, fighting to stay in contention for the Playoffs, fell short by 11 runs, with the already eliminated Delhi spoiling the part for Rohit Sharma and Co. Head-to-head, Delhi have a slender 12-11 lead over Mumbai in the Indian T20 League, and having endured defeats in both matches last season, a wounded Mumbai would want to start their campaign on a high at home. (READ: Hurt Mumbai Indian eager for tunraround)\nFor Mumbai, there ought to plenty concerns surrounding the workload management for the likes of Rohit, Hardik Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah, three players who are a sure-shot certainty for the World Cup. Individually too, after an underwhelming season last year, all these three players promise to be highly motivated to start Mumbai s run with a win. Each time Mumbai have started well in a tournament, they ve made it to the Playoffs. Last year, they lost the first three matches and were left to play catch-up. (READ: Delhi hope for Capital gains)\nYet another season, Delhi form a strong team on paper, but replicating it on the field is what poses to be a challenge for a side that s come under heavy criticism for under-performing. This year though, the composition looks a whole lot better than the previous seasons and the presence of international cricketers in their ranks should pave way for better results. Will Delhi be able to snap their barren run? Or will turn out to be another season of more misses than hits? Sunday marks the beginning."

        "label": "Emraan Hashmi's 'Why Cheat India'",
        "articles": [
            "Just days before it was to be released the Censors demanded that the makers of Cheat India attach the word \u2018Why\u2019 to its title, presumably because the original title sounded a lot like a call to action, a command. And come on, you can\u2019t have a film actively encouraging the populace to swindle our great nation, can you?Why Cheat India, on the other hand, sounds too generic, and punctuation wise it\u2019s off. Is it asking a question \u2013 as in why do we, Indians, tend to cheat? That\u2019s a tricky one; we could be here all day. No, I suspect, that like movie critics, the Censors too might have been bored out of their skull watching this film. The new title, therefore, could be an expression of frustration \u2013 as if questioning the need for this film \u2013 \u201cWhy, Cheat India???\u201dBut jokes aside, the movie, directed by Soumik Sen, has an interesting premise. Emraan Hashmi, who has had some practice playing all manner of cheaters and fraudsters, stars as Rakesh Singh aka Rocky, a shrewd fellow who runs a scam helping wealthy candidates land seats in medical and engineering colleges by recruiting smarter students to take their entrance exams for them. He\u2019s a messiah for desperate parents and students who know that a medical or engineering degree is a shot at a better life, and a Robin Hood-like figure for the brilliant but poor toppers who have loans to be paid off, parents to support, and sisters to be wed. Everybody wins in Rocky\u2019s unique business plan.Everybody but the audience. Why Cheat India fast becomes a slog. The themes are relevant, but the writing is flat; the screenplay lacks urgency. The film opens in the 90s and to be honest it feels like it was made then. There is melodrama, dialoguebaazi, and old-school plotting. None of that would\u2019ve been a problem if it wasn\u2019t so darn unremarkable. The supporting players \u2013 there are many \u2013 aren\u2019t especially memorable, and a last minute twist feels unconvincing. The second half moves more briskly but the plot becomes especially harebrained when Rocky widens his net to crack the MBA entrance exam.It\u2019s a shame you leave the cinema bored and underwhelmed because there was potential here to make a smart film about our flawed education system \u2013 one that encourages mugging and rote learning over understanding; one that values a degree over real aptitude. A system that drives students and their parents to seek dangerous, unhealthy shortcuts. Some of that is addressed but it\u2019s not really what the film is about.Hashmi, who is also one of the producers, plays his part with required flair. He\u2019s very good in anti-hero roles, but this film can\u2019t seem to decide how to peg him. He spends the bulk of his time on screen exploiting the education system, but also gets to deliver an impassioned monologue skewering the corruption within that very system. Of the remaining ensemble, only Snighadeep Chatterjee as Sattu, one of the bright young students who falls under Rocky\u2019s spell, and Shreya Dhanwanthary as Sattu\u2019s sister Nupur, make an impression.I was also never fully convinced about the ease with which Rocky repeatedly pulled off these big scams. But I suppose that\u2019s creative liberty. This fim takes a lot of those. I\u2019m going with two out of five for Why Cheat India. If anyone\u2019s having trouble sleeping, we might have found a cure.Write your review here:Follow @news18movies for more"

            "A meteor lit up the sky over Botswana, Africa, early Saturday evening. Scientists discovered the six-foot-wide asteroid just hours before it reached Earth.\nNASA tracks 90 percent of near-Earth objects that are larger than 150 meters (~460 feet) in diameter, which means it misses lots of the smaller ones until they\u2019re close by. This most recent rock, called 2018 LA, was spotted on June 2 by the Catalina Sky Survey in Arizona. At that point, the asteroid was almost as near as the moon, according to a release. Researchers realized it was on a collision course with Earth, and were able to predict a few locations over a large swath of the planet\u2019s surface. Followup observations allowed astronomers to pinpoint a probable collision with southern Africa.\nA rock entered the atmosphere traveling around 38,000 miles per hour at 6:44 pm Botswana time, creating a fireball, lining up with the predictions.\nAdvertisement\nHere\u2019s a video:\nThis rock, like every small asteroid that hits or flies close by the Earth only a short time after its detection, confirms what we always say about asteroids. When scientists talk about \u201cpotentially hazardous\u201d asteroids, they\u2019re referring to bigger ones that have a chance to hit Earth eventually, but not in the foreseeable future. The asteroids that do hit Earth, such as 2018 LA, typically occur with little to no warning.\nG/O Media may get a commission 10% off 10% off Wish A gift for literally everybody.\nGifts under $20, $10, and even $5.

But sometimes they can pack a punch, such as the Chelyabinsk meteor.\nOf course, the odds of being harmed by a meteorite are exceedingly low, as National Geographic reported. But if you\u2019re planning on making any calls to your representatives today about space, it might be worth bringing up increased funding for asteroid tracking."

The iconic art-style from Akira Toriyama (Dragon Ball, Chrono Trigger) was on full display, and we had a taste of the localized English voice acting.\nEarly in the game, you'll arrive at the city of Heliodor, where the main character Hero is referred to as a \"Luminary\", which is a common class title in past Dragon Quest games. Hero is sent to jail by King Carnelian, who seems to have a vendetta against luminaries, believing they're conspiring with darkness.\nDragon Quest XI comes to PlayStation 4 and PC worldwide on September 14, 2018, while the Nintendo Switch version does not have a release date yet. Pre-orders are now open and there will be two separate editions of the game. The game launched in Japan for PS4 and Nintendo 3DS in July last year and sold extremely well, with over three million units sold in a four-month period."

            "A gorgeous late strike from Ousmane Dembele help lift Barcelona past Sevilla in Morocco in the Spanish Super Cup final on Sunday. In a tight match that also saw a late penalty kick from Sevilla saved by Barca keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, it was Lionel Messi and company that took home another trophy ahead of La Liga starting next weekend.\nDembele scores gorgeous winner\nAfter Pablo Sarabia opened the scoring with a fine finish on nine minutes, Barca's Gerard Pique scored just before halftime on a saved Lionel Messi free kick to draw level. And with the Spanish Super Cup hanging in the balance, it was an unexpected talent who secured the win.\nOusmane Dembele, trying to show he has what it takes to be a consistent player for the team, fired home an outrageous shot 78 minutes in off the crossbar and in to seal the victory:\nA brick wall between Barca's posts\nA collision between ter Stegen and Aleix Vidal resulted in a penalty kick awarded in the final minutes of the match. Wissam Ben Yedder, in added time, went low and to the right of the frame, and so too did Ter Stegen, who made the game-clinching stop.\nPlayer of the match\nDembele. He was lively, confident and took his chance really well. Not many people thought he was going to take that shot, but he did just that and produced his most important goal for the club since arriving last year.\nMessi, the king\nMessi made history by becoming the most honored player at the club. With the Spanish Super Cup on Sunday, the Argentine superstar, who wore the captain's armband, clinched his 33rd trophy, which is more than any player in club history. Andre Iniesta, who now plays in Japan after moving to Vissel Kobe this summer, was tied with Messi at 32.\nWhat record does he not hold at the club? What a legend.\nWhat result means\nIt was a well-deserved result for Barcelona, which had almost 70 percent of the possession and put eight shots on frame, but the lack of clinical finishing kept Sevilla in it. It never really felt like Sevilla was much of a threat to win this one, and Barca put the game away late.\nBarca has some momentum entering La Liga, while Sevilla played valiantly but needs to figure out what the team will look like in attack. With Ben Yedder and the recently-added Andre Silva, there are options available with Luis Muriel, but finding a partnership duo that understands each other well will be key for this team against the physical defense of the Spanish league."

            "22 Apr 2019 17.27 BST Let\u2019s get to the big movers and shakers today, then. Here are the highlights. Championship: Norwich recorded their fourth draw on the spin but remain three points clear of Sheffield United, who won comfortably at Hull City. Derby capitalised on defeats for Middlesbrough and Bristol City by scoring two injury-time goals in a 2-0 victory over QPR \u2013 Frank Lampard\u2019s side leap from eighth into sixth and a play-off berth. Down the bottom, things started so brightly for Rotherham at home to Birmingham, taking a 1-0 lead, but they limped to a 3-1 defeat and must make up at least three points in their final two matches against West Brom and Boro. League One: Barnsley romped to a 3-0 win at Plymouth, and climb into second. Sunderland conceded a late equaliser at Peterborough and slip to fourth \u2013 you would think they need to beat third-placed Portsmouth on Saturday to stand any chance of automatic promotion now. What a huge game that is. Down the bottom, a big result for Southend lifted them clear of the relegation zone but it\u2019s very tight down there: three points separate five clubs, including the Essex club and Accrington Stanley, Plymouth, Scunthorpe and AFC Wimbledon. League Two: Lincoln are confirmed as champions, and it\u2019s as you were at the bottom three, with Macclesfield, Yeovil and Notts County all drawing. What a chance missed for Yeovil in particular, who were 1-0 up against 10-man Colchester, only to blow their lead. I\u2019m going for a lie down. For all the Football League results, click here.

It\u2019s usually only one or two from the Championship a week--whichever ones are on English TV--and just once in a great while Leagues One or Two. No US commentators, either--it\u2019s the same feed as the one you could watch in the UK. Today is the first time since February I\u2019ve watched my Potters. Please print this, if only to call attention to the fact that there are U.S. born and bred Stoke fans.\u201d\n22 Apr 2019 17.05 BST Free-kick to QPR on the edge of the area, they could yet ruin Derby\u2019s day! Freeman\u2019s delivery is a poor one, but he gets a second chance to cross \u2026 it\u2019s a goalmouth scramble \u2026 EVENTUALLY cleared by Derby! Now they\u2019re on the counter-attack, Derby streaming forward in numbers, and Derby score a second! Harry Wilson gets his second in the 101st minute, tapping in at the far post after Jack Marriott squared it. Derby 2-0 QPR! Frank Lampard jumps for joy following his Derby\u2019s victory. Photograph: Aaron Lupton/ProSports/Rex/Shutterstock\nUpdated at 17.25 BST\n22 Apr 2019 17.01 BST Re Oldham v Mansfield being shown in the US of A \u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s an English commentator, but not like NBC,\u201d reports Morgan Dodd. \u201cIt appears that ESPN just has a deal and takes the feed. Kind of like how Fox Soccer Match Pass would also allow me to watch Salford vs. Huddersfield Rugby, pitch black there but the afternoon here. Looks like a great atmosphere.\u201d\n22 Apr 2019 17.00 BST Lincoln City are champions of League Two! Lincoln\u2019s title in confirmed with a 0-0 draw with Tranmere. Not the way they would have wanted to get over the line but it\u2019s been a magnificent season for Danny Cowley and co.\n22 Apr 2019 16.59 BST GOAL! Derby 1-0 QPR (Wilson 90+4 pen) What a HUUUUUGE goal this could be in the race for sixth in the Championship. Harry Wilson passes it into the bottom corner, but this was never a penalty. Freeman is adjudged to have brought down Bogle in the box but he won the ball, a terrible decision from the referee. What is does mean is that Derby leapfrog Bristol City and Boro (who both lost today) into sixth place!\n22 Apr 2019 16.57 BST Full-time: Stoke City 2-2 Norwich Norwich can\u2019t get the win, but Stoke were well worth their draw. Both sets of players collapse on the turf at the full-time whistle. Norwich three points clear at the top of the Championship with two games to play.

Rotherham 1-3 Birmingham (Mrabti 90+3) That\u2019s that for Rotherham, who look destined for relegation now after taking the lead today. They\u2019ve got West Brom and Boro to play in their final two games, and are three points off safety/Millwall.\n22 Apr 2019 16.53 BST Full-time: Hull City 0-3 Sheffield United Chris Wilder\u2019s side do the business. They have held up their end, Leeds kick off in just under half an hour at Brentford.\n22 Apr 2019 16.51 BST GOAL! Peterborough 0-1 Sunderland (Power 87) The delightfully-named Max Power looks like he has scored a late winner for Sunderland! It\u2019s been an awful game, but Power has thumped it home from distance. Thousands of Mackems go wild in the away end, red flares are let off, the works! Sunderland up to third, leapfrogging Portsmouth, who they face on Saturday!\n22 Apr 2019 16.49 BST Norwich are pushing hard for a winner at Stoke, it\u2019s still 2-2 there, after Hernandez dragged a left-footed shot wide of the far post. As it stands, the Canaries are three points clear of Sheffield United with two matches left and six points clear of Leeds, who have a game in hand.\n22 Apr 2019 16.46 BST \u201cWatching on ESPN+ in the US, and it seems like Oldham and Mansfield Town are both giving more effort and have more crowd support than most PL teams,\u201d emails Morgan Dodd.\nHang on, you can watch Mansfield Town live in the USA? With US commentators?!\nUpdated at 16.47 BST\n22 Apr 2019 16.44 BST GOAL! Nottingham Forest 3-0 Middlesbrough (Lolley 85) Boro have been absolutely dreadful today. Normally they keep things tight at the back \u2013 just 36 goals conceded in 43 games going into today \u2013 but they\u2019ve been ripped apart by Joao Carvalho, Forest\u2019s record signing who has been given a rare start today. As it stands, Boro are still sixth.\n22 Apr 2019 16.39 BST GOAL! Yeovil 1-1 Colchester (Eastman 75) Massive goal at the bottom of League Two and it\u2019s 10-man Colchester who have got the goal to send Yeovil tumbling back into the drop zone. It\u2019s as you were at the start of the day then, with Macclesfield two points clear of Yeovil and Notts County below them. All three teams are drawing today.\n22 Apr 2019 16.37 BST Still goalless between Derby and QPR. Frank Lampard\u2019s side would go into sixth with a win today, and Mason Mount has just had an effort tipped onto the post by Joe Lumley \u2013 the Chelsea loanee was through on goal and got a very poor connection on his shot.\n22 Apr 2019 16.34 BST Charlton are absolutely roasting Scunthorpe at home. Four-nil up, Lyle Taylor the latest to get a goal \u2013 he\u2019s been a menace all afternoon for the London side, who sit comfortably in fifth. Scunthorpe drop into the relegation zone in League One with this result.\n22 Apr 2019 16.32 BST GOAL! Bury 2-1 Northampton (Mayor 65) Bury up to second in League Two with that goal! Just one point separates them, Mansfield (losing 3-2 at Oldham), and MK Dons (drawing 1-1 at home to Port Vale).\nUpdated at 16.34 BST\n22 Apr 2019 16.30 BST GOAL! Stoke City 2-2 Norwich City (Edwards 69) Stoke hit back immediately! And what a goal this is: the right back absolutely thumps it from the edge of the area, cutting across the ball, his shot flying low into the far corner past Tim Krul. Stoke have been the better side here, but this game could go either way! Stoke City\u2019s Tom Edwards celebrates scoring his side\u2019s second goal.

Stoke City 1-2 Norwich City (Pukki 66) It\u2019s been all Stoke this second half \u2013 Clucas missed an absolute sitter a couple of minutes ago \u2013 but Norwich and Pukki have been ruthless, just as they have been all season. Vrancic, on as a sub, sent a delightful cross into the area from the left, and Pukki got across his man, glacing the ball into the far corner. Norwich regain their five point lead at the top of the Championship. Teemu Pukki scores again. Photograph: Nathan Stirk/Getty Images\nUpdated at 16.45 BST\n22 Apr 2019 16.26 BST GOAL! Rotherham 1-2 Birmingham (Jota 63) After taking a 1-0 lead, two quick goals for Birmingham City mean that they are not trailing. It was Maghoma who equalised for the Blues and Jota has just put them in front: a calm finish low into the corner after good work down the right wing. Stat attack: Birmingham have not won in 62 away games after falling behind. Today could be the day. Millwall fans will be delighted, Rotherham are fading fast at the bottom. Jacques Maghoma slams in the Birmingham equaliser. Photograph: Matt West/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock\nUpdated at 16.32 BST\n22 Apr 2019 16.22 BST GOAL! Nottingham Forest 2-0 Middlesbrough (Milosevic 64) Things going from bad to worse for Boro, who are clinging on to sixth place in the Championship by their fingernails.\n22 Apr 2019 16.20 BST GOAL! Ipswich 0-1 Swansea (Routledge 57) It doesn\u2019t mean much, with Ipswich down and Swansea in mid-table, but Wayne Routledge continues his good form. The veteran winger is out of contract this summer and is chasing a new deal.\n22 Apr 2019 16.18 BST GOAL! Yeovil 1-0 Colchester (Gray 53) Huge goal at the bottom of League Two \u2013 Yeovil climbing out of the League Two relegation zone on goal difference. Gray got the goal and in the ensuing celebration, Dillon Barnes is sent off for Colchester! To make things even better for Yeovil, relegation rivals Notts County \u2013 currently drawing 1-1 with Crawley \u2013 have just had a man sent off: Ben Barclay seeing red for a two-footed challenge!\n22 Apr 2019 16.14 BST GOAL! MK Dons 1-1 Port Vale (Wheeler 52) Port Vale\u2019s lead didn\u2019t last long, and just like that, MK Dons are back in the automatic promotion spots in League Two.\n22 Apr 2019 16.13 BST GOAL! Blackburn 2-0 Bolton (Armstrong 50) Bradley Dack is the creator again, turning neatly inside the area and cutting the ball back. It\u2019s a bit of a mess but Adam Armstrong \u2013 so good against QPR on Friday \u2013 eventually turns the ball home, against his former side.\n22 Apr 2019 16.10 BST GOAL! MK Dons 0-1 Port Vale (Conlon 48) MK Dons tumble out of the automatic promotion spots in League Two with that goal! They are fourth on goal difference, with Bury now third \u2013 they are drawing 1-1 with Northampton at present."

        "articles": [
            "It feels like it's been summer for a long time, but autumn has finally arrived in New England and basketball season is soon to follow. The Boston Celtics are about to start training camp and, if you ask them, everything's as cool as the upcoming weather. Now, they would say that, as the weeks leading up to the preseason, which culminated with today's Media Day festivities, basically amount to an opportunity for NBA teams to advertise the upcoming season. For this year's Media Day, what the Celtics were selling was optimism.\nGranted, the Celtics are in a better position to convince their fans that the next nine months are going to go swimmingly than the majority of the other teams in the league. They're coming into the season as the Eastern Conference favorites and, if the Celtics' starting lineup remains healthy, some experts even have them pegged as the second most talented team in the league. Still, this is New England, where high expectations are often paired with deep-rooted pessimism. There have been lingering concerns about this team throughout the offseason and it's in the team's best interest to assuage their fans' biggest fears before they start trying to sell them tickets and merchandise (oh and Gatorade).\nThe spin began earlier this month when the team addressed last season's biggest disappointment. Gordon Hayward, only months removed from signing a four-year, $128 million contract, suffered a season-ending ankle injury in his Celtics debut. While Boston had remarkable success without him, there's no question that any chance that the Celtics have as far as making a championship run this year lies with having a healthy and effective Hayward.\nSo there Hayward was, addressing the media for the first time in ages, assuring everybody that he would be ready for the start of the regular season, although he's still working his way to being 100%. \"The last step for me as far from a physical standpoint is a little explosion,\" he said during the September 13th press conference, \"that little last juice bounce that you get. So that's going to take me the longest time, but like I said, for the most part, I feel very good.\"\nMeanwhile, Kyrie Irving, who also says he's heading for a full recovery following season-ending surgery, is trying to convince everybody that, despite rumors to the contrary, he's not heading anywhere. In an interview with ESPN's Jackie MacMullan, Irving pulled out all the stops in emphasizing that he sees himself in Boston for the foreseeable future. \"Who wouldn't be a part of this?\" he proclaimed while confidently saying that the Celtics could beat the Golden State Warriors in a seven-game series. As far as those ever-present rumors that he wants to team up with Jimmy Butler, who is currently working his way out of Minnesota? Why, Irving says he hasn't talked with Butler since 2016.\nNothing, of course, compares to the feel-good vibes of Media Day, the Monday before training camps officially open across the NBA. Is Jayson Tatum, coming off a phenomenal rookie season, going to be happy with fewer minutes after his breakout last season? \"We have a lot of coachable guys on this team that are willing to do whatever it takes to win,\" he said while also repeating the line that the team can hold their own against the Warriors.\nJaylen Brown might end up coming off the bench this season, despite a playoff campaign that proved he would be a starter on most teams. He didn't think the team's crowded roster would affect team chemistry either, adding \"we don't see each other as enemies. We don't want to beat each other up too much. We're trying to beat up whoever else we're going to be competing against.\"\nSome of this preseason optimism is just for show, an attempt at putting the best face possible heading into a year where the expectations could not be higher. That doesn't mean that the players don't also feel it. After an off-season where management went all-in with the previous season's roster, why wouldn't everybody involved feel good about their chances? When Irving and Tatum say that they have a chance at beat the Warriors in the NBA Finals, they believe it. They're not just trying to put up a front to convince the media and, thus, their fans (although they might also be doing just that).\nThe Celtics were a very good team last season. They should be an even better one this time around. There will be plenty of time for worry and doubt during the grind of the regular season as they face the inevitable challenges that the 82 game schedule will throw at them. This? This is a time to be cheerful. Basketball is back in New England, in every possible way."

            "The Test series was conceded without much of a fight, but South Africa head into the five-match one-day internationals \u2013 the opener will be played on Sunday, 29 July \u2013 hoping the change in formats will change their fortunes.\nIn particular, they will want a better show against spin. In the 2-0 reversal in the Tests, South Africa were completely flummoxed by all of Rangana Herath, Dilruwan Perera, Lakshan Sandkan and Akil Dananjaya over the course of the two matches.\nHowever, the ODI side has plenty of fresh faces, unscarred by the Test series loss, and JP Duminy said they were \u201ccoming in with fresh energy, that will definitely add to the environment.\u201d\nIn fact, South Africa are hoping to do more than just cope. With the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 looming closer by the day, the visitors are aiming to make the most of the spin-friendly conditions in the sub-continent, what with wrist-spinners being all the rage now and most teams at the big event next year sure to use them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge value for us to be here \u2013 we\u2019re not in the subcontinent again for a while,\u201d said Dale Benkenstein, the South Africa batting coach. \u201cEven though we\u2019ve had a poor Test series, there\u2019s been a lot of work done on spin for a lot of batters. There\u2019s been a lot of learning going on. We\u2019re seeing this as a great opportunity to just get better.\n\u201cNot only the guys who are playing, but some of the young guys who are with us now. We tell them to use these conditions. Use the nets. Ask people around you. Try and get as much out of it as you can, other than just in the matches that are going on.\u201d\nSouth Africa lost their last ODI series 5-1, against India at home in February, with Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav taking 33 wickets between them. If the last few months are any indication, spin remains an area of concern for their batsmen, and as Benkenstein said, they have to make the most of their trip to the sub-continent.\nSri Lanka, meanwhile, have no such concerns. In January, they won the ODI tri-series in Bangladesh quite easily, seeing off the hosts and Zimbabwe en route.\nThey will be confident of carrying on that form. Angelo Mathews, their designated ODI captain, will take the reins again, even as Dinesh Chandimal, who stood in for him while Mathews was injured, serves a four-match ODI ban.\nIt is clear the hosts will continue playing to their strengths, with Dananjaya and Sandakan joined by the uncapped Prabath Jayasuriya, a highly touted left-arm spinner.\nThat said, in a format less grilling than Tests, South Africa will be confident of faring better.\nThe first ODI between Sri Lanka and South Africa will be played at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium, Dambulla on Sunday, July 29 and will begin at 04:15 GMT.\nSquads\nSri Lanka: Angelo Mathews (c), Dasun Shanaka, Kusal Perera, Dhananjaya de Silva, Upul Tharanga, Kusal Mendis, Thisara Perera, Niroshan Dickwella, Suranga Lakmal, Lahiru Kumara, Kasun Rajitha, Akila Dananjaya, Prabath Jayasuriya, Lakshan Sandakan, Shehan Jayasuriya\nSouth Africa: Faf du Plessis(c), Hashim Amla, Junior Dala, Quinton de Kock, Jean-Paul Duminy, Reeza Hendricks, Heinrich Klaasen, Keshav Maharaj, Aiden Markram, David Miller, Willem Mulder, Lungi Ngidi, Andile Phehlukwayo, Kagiso Rabada, Tabraiz Shamsi"

The woman, she said, came running from the back of the plane after it landed. The flight was diverted because a man sitting near the front of the jetliner suffered from some sort of medical emergency, she said.\nHe was taken off the plane and the woman was removed by authorities, who took her to a hospital for a mental health evaluation after they were told she is a veteran battling PTSD, USA Today reported.\n\u201cThis morning a flight from Houston to Minneapolis had to land in Rochester, Minnesota, due to a guest experiencing a medical emergency,\u201d Derek Dombrowski, spokesman for Spirit Airlines said in a statement. \u201cOn the ground in Rochester, another passenger became erratic and irate and was removed from the aircraft with the assistance of law enforcement.

And it\u2019s been a wonderful journey thus far and taking the next step to move onto a courtship.\u201d\nSays Burnett, \u201cA lot of prayer, a lot of counsel, a lot of time together.\u201d\nIn 2014, oldest brother Josh told PEOPLE that the Duggars don\u2019t \u201cdate,\u201d they \u201ccourt.\u201d\n\u201cA courtship is a path toward marriage,\u201d he said. During the courtship period, possible mates spend time together with family members there to supervise, never alone.\nAs for the physical parameters, \u201cEmotions get heated the closer you get,\u201d mom Michelle Duggar told PEOPLE at the time. \u201cYou\u2019re like two magnets being pulled together. You need boundaries.\u201d\nThe courtship comes at an exciting time for the Duggar family, who will be soon be welcoming another family member. Next month, Jinger Duggar is due to welcome her first child, a baby girl, with husband Jeremy Vuolo.\nUs Weekly first reported the news of the courtship.\nCounting On returns July 30 at 9 p.m. ET on TLC."

            "Hollywood is gearing up for the Oscars (Picture: AFP/Getty Images)\nHollywood is rolling out the red carpet for its biggest night of the year as the Oscars takes place on Sunday night.\nThis year\u2019s Academy Awards is set to be as star-studded as ever \u2013 and look a little different from normal, as the show will have no single presenter but will be hosted by a bunch of famous faces.\nAs far as the awards themselves go, it\u2019s looking to be a good night for Alfonso Cuaron\u2019s Roma, which is heavily tipped to take the best film prize \u2013 and in doing so become the first ever foreign language film to bag the big one.\nCuaron himself could also add another best director gong to the heap he\u2019s earned this season \u2013 while Rami Malek and Glenn Close are among those competing in the acting categories.\nWill Glenn Close finally be rewarded with an Oscar? (Picture: Reuters)\nIt could be a great night for British talent too, with Olivia Colman, Richard E Grant, Christian Bale and Rachel Weisz among those going for gold.\nOther films in the running for best picture include Black Panther, BlackKKlansman, Bohemian Rhapsody, The Favourite, Green Book, A Star Is Born and Vice.\nIt\u2019s set to be an exciting night \u2013 but can you watch it if you live on this side of the pond?\nWhere can you watch and stream the Oscars in the UK?\nLast year Sam Rockwell, Frances McDormand, Allison Janney and Gary Oldman had a very good night (Picture: Reuters)\nThe ceremony, which is taking place at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, kicks off at 5pm LA time on Sunday \u2013 which means it\u2019ll be 1am Monday morning before things get going here.\nThat means you\u2019ll have to stay up most of the night if you want to see it live \u2013 which you can do by tuning into Sky Cinema\u2019s dedicated Oscars channel.\nYou don\u2019t necessarily need to be a Sky subscriber to watch it, however, as you can get a Sky Cinema Pass on Now TV for free if you\u2019re a new customer \u2013 or it\u2019ll cost you \u00a39.99 a month if you\u2019re not.\nIf you don\u2019t fancy sitting up all night, Sky Cinema Oscars will be re-showing the ceremony at 8am tomorrow morning.\nThey\u2019ll also be airing a two hour highlights show on Monday night at 8pm, while the highlights will also be screened on Sky One at 9pm tomorrow night.\nThe best bits will also appear on the Oscars\u2019 official YouTube channel."

            "Nothing revs the hearts of automobile aficionados quite like Monterey Car Week. Every August, lovers of rare models, exotics and concept cars head to Northern California for the world\u2019s premier auto exhibitions.\nAnchoring the week is the Pebble Beach Concours d\u2019Elegance, which began in 1950 and features the Tour d\u2019Elegance, a slow-moving museum of vintage cars that parades along the Monterey Peninsula's famed 17-Mile Drive. There is also The Quail: A Motorsports Gathering in nearby Carmel, which started its engines in 2003 and features the debut of several supercars\u2014among this year\u2019s reveals were the Lambghini Hurac\u00e1n SVJ and the Bugatti Divo\u2014and concept cars.\nThe finale of the Concours d'Elegance, of course, is the competition among different classes of classic autos\u2014including Prewar Preservation, which features cars that have never been restored, and the Postwar Sports class, which showcases famous race cars.\nThis year's Best of Show was a 1937 Alfa Romeo 2900B Touring Berlinetta owned by David and Ginny Sydorick of Beverly Hills, California. The couple have entered the Concours for several years but had never won top honors. \"That dream came true today and it's just spectacular\u2014with a spectacular car,\" said David Sydorick in a post-awards interview. \"We had a wonderful crew on this car, a wonderful restoration group and wonderful detailing people. And it's a beautiful piece of artwork.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 Kimball Studios / Courtesy of Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance\nThe Alpha Car: Best of Show at the 2018 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance was a 1937 Alfa Romeo 8C 2900B Touring Berlinetta.\nThere were also several high-profile auctions during Monterey Car Week\u2014which brought in more than $360 million in total sales. At RM Sotheby\u2019s, one of the most coveted cars in the world\u2014a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO, the third ever built\u2014sold for a record $48.4 million.

            "James Murdoch, the scion of billionaire and Fox News founder Rupert Murdoch, gave the maximum possible donation to 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign.\nMurdoch donated $2,800 to Buttigieg, the largest amount possible to a primary candidate, according to recently filed Federal Election Commission reports. Murdoch joins other high-profile figures \u2014 including Susan Rice, formerly the National Security Adviser under President Barack Obama, and actor Ryan Reynolds \u2014 in supporting the 37-year-old Harvard graduate\u2019s White House bid. Buttigieg has enjoyed a recent bounce in the polls thanks to a torrent of wall-to-wall media coverage.\nAccording to an Emerson Polling survey released Monday, Buttigieg now ranks third in popularity among Democrat presidential contenders with only former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) ahead of him.\nMurdoch, who served as CEO of 21st Century Fox, is described as a political centrist, reports the New York Times. Since leaving the Fox empire this March, Murdoch founded launched an investment group named Lupa Systems. James\u2019 old brother Lachlan, who is seen as the more right-leaning of the two, recently took control over Fox Corp., the parent company of the Fox News Channel.\nThe Walt Disney Company acquired 21st Century Fox for $71.3 billion on March 20th.\nButtigieg officially launched his 2020 campaign in South Bend over the weekend, vowing to usher in \u201ca new generation of leadership.\u201d This month, Buttigieg\u2019s campaign announced it raised more than $7 million in the first three months of 2019."

Worked on your shrine to some arbitrary ping pong balls?\nAnything for that No. 1 Overall Pick. pic.twitter.com/uSXE4bukg4 \u2014 LA Kings (@LAKings) April 9, 2019\nThe wait will be over soon: by the end of the night, we\u2019ll know exactly where the Kings will be drafting come the summer, and we\u2019ll know if that one dude who already got a Jack Hughes jersey was really jumping the gun or not.\nIn case you need a refresher, thanks to the Kings\u2019 30th place finish, they hold a 13.5% chance of being awarded the first overall draft pick. The lottery process is conducted for the top three picks.\nThe Kings will draft no lower than fifth, thanks to their finish.\nThe festivities get underway at 8:00 pm Eastern/5:00 pm Pacific time and the lottery itself, being stretched out into an hour-long show, will air on NBCSN, Sportsnet and TVA Sports.\nRefresh this post frequently, as we\u2019ll be liveblogging the events. Hang out in the comments to speculate, celebrate, or otherwise be terrified that somehow, some way, the Oilers are going to mess this up for everyone else.\n5:00 p.m.: After a significant amount of time spent watching a car auction on NBCSN, we\u2019ve already gotten our first glimpse of Jack Hughes. He\u2019s wearing a light blue suit and doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s going to throw up or anything, so that\u2019s a positive so far.\nBut first, we need to sit through some talking heads telling us about the playoffs. You know, the thing we\u2019re not going to. Also, even here, we cannot escape Keith Jones.\nDoes anyone have a line on Pierre McGuire? They\u2019re not letting him near Hughes, right?\n5:08 p.m.: The Sportsnet feed, highlighting the Calgary Flames, showed a clip of Adrian Kempe scoring against them, which might be the only time we get to see a nice Kings thing for a while, given that we have to sit through this playoff preview.\n5:15 p.m.:\n5:18 p.m.: Jack Hughes just suffered through an interview and I have three first impressions:\nAre we sure he\u2019s actually old enough to be drafted? He sure is, uh, not very tall, huh? Quality bland hockey answers, he\u2019ll fit in perfectly.\n5:25 p.m.: Please, NBCSN, I would pay you to not have to hear about the Vegas Golden Knights.\n5:35 p.m.: We\u2019ve been introduced to the hockey men representing their teams, including Luc Robitaille, who is probably concerned about his wife Stacia\u2019s promise earlier:\n...or he won\u2019t be getting lucky at home. \u2014 Stacia Robitaille (@StaciaRR) April 9, 2019\n5:42 p.m.: WELP\nKings draft fifth.

            "Unlike last season, when their pursuit of All-Star defenseman Erik Karlsson was one of the major storylines, all was quiet on the trade front for the Golden Knights leading up to Monday\u2019s noon deadline.\nGolden Knights general manager George McPhee takes questions during a press conference after practice on Wednesday, Oct. 3, 2018, at City National Arena, in Las Vegas. Benjamin Hager Las Vegas Review-Journal @benjaminhphoto\nPhiladelphia Flyers right wing Wayne Simmonds (17) celebrates with teammates Robert Hagg (8) and Mikhail Vorobyev (24) after scoring a second period goal during their NHL hockey game with the Golden Knights on Thursday, Oct. 4, 2018, at T-Mobile Arena, in Las Vegas. Benjamin Hager Las Vegas Review-Journal @benjaminhphoto\nIf this was social media, the Golden Knights\u2019 trade deadline activity could be depicted with a GIF of a tumbleweed rolling across a barren desert highway.\nThe widely used meme of the White Ninja character poking general manager George McPhee with a stick under the caption of \u201cC\u2019mon, do something\u201d would also do the trick.\nUnlike last season, when their pursuit of All-Star defenseman Erik Karlsson was one of the major storylines, all was quiet on the trade front for the Knights leading up to Monday\u2019s noon deadline.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking to clubs now,\u201d McPhee said prior to Friday\u2019s 6-3 home loss to Winnipeg. \u201cWe\u2019re being aggressive and talking to everyone about what\u2019s out there, what does it cost, how does it affect us in the future. If there\u2019s a way to help the team right now, you do, if it makes sense.\u201d\nMcPhee watched that game against the Jets with interest, as it was the latest example of the Knights not measuring up with the league\u2019s top teams.\nThe Knights are 10-18-2 against the other 15 clubs that currently occupy a playoff spot, including a 5-9 mark against the Western Conference.\nAfter losing 10 of their past 13 games, the Knights have fallen out of the race for the Pacific Division title and suddenly are looking over their shoulder at fourth-place Arizona, which is six points back with a game in hand.\n\u201cThe bottom line is, we control our own destiny,\u201d coach Gerard Gallant said. \u201cWe have to win hockey games. If we\u2019re going to continue down the path we\u2019ve been the last three weeks, then we\u2019re going to have a tough time. We\u2019re going to have a battle. If we want to start playing the way we\u2019re capable of playing and finishing off games and winning games, it won\u2019t be an issue.\u201d\nGallant shook up his forward lines again during Sunday\u2019s practice at City National Arena, and it\u2019s up to McPhee whether to add another piece(s) for the final 19 games or stick with the current group.\nOttawa right wing Mark Stone and Philadelphia right wing Wayne Simmonds, both of whom will be unrestricted free agents, remain the biggest names on the market.\nThe Senators received a first-round pick, two prospects and another conditional first-round pick from Columbus in exchange for center Matt Duchene, and the asking price for Stone is likely to be similar. Winnipeg hasn\u2019t been shy about its pursuit of the 26-year-old Manitoba native, while Boston, Calgary and Nashville also have been linked.\nThe Flyers\u2019 asking price for Simmonds is expected to include a first-round pick, though it remains to be seen whether the Knights \u2014 or teams like Tampa Bay, Boston, Toronto, Calgary or Winnipeg \u2014 are willing to give up that.\nThe Knights own three third-round picks and three fifth-round picks in 2019 along with three second-round picks in 2020.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the depth that other organizations have,\u201d McPhee said. \u201cOur picks and prospects mean a lot more to us than other clubs do because they\u2019ve probably got a lot more. We\u2019ve done a very, very good job of stockpiling good, young players and picks, but we\u2019re two years old.\u201d\nMcPhee traditionally is active at the deadline and could look at defensemen such as Ottawa\u2019s Cody Ceci or Shayne Gostisbehere of Philadelphia.\nUp front, Andre Burakovsky of Washington is a former McPhee draft pick, while Florida\u2019s Jonathan Huberdeau, who played for Gallant in juniors, would be a splashy acquisition.\nMore Golden Knights: Follow at reviewjournal.com/ GoldenKnights and @ HockeyinVegas on Twitter.\nContact David Schoen at dschoen@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-5203.

            "Recent rumors have revealed that Google Pixel 3 Lite and Pixel 3 XL Lite are the two upcoming phones from the company. Multiple leaks have revealed the specifications, features and images of the Lite version of the Pixel 3 duo. Yesterday, Russian tech blogger Andro News shared a review video of the phone on YouTube to reveal what to expect from it.\nGoogle Pixel 3 Lite Design\nThe Pixel 3 Lite is a cheaper edition of the Pixel 3. Even though the Pixel 3 Lite resembles the Pixel 3, the Lite variant comes with a polycarbonate instead of metal and glass and it is packed with weaker specs.\nGoogle Pixel 3, 3 XL, Pixel 2 and 2 XL do not feature 3.5mm audio jack. The Pixel 3 Xl Lite hands-on video reveals that it features a 3.5mm audio jack and a microphone. There is a bright colored power button along with a volume rocker on the right edge. The SIM card slot is available on the left edge.\nThe rear panel of the Pixel 3 Lite sports a two-tone design. A fingerprint scanner and a single camera which lacks autofocus sensor are present on the rear shell of the device. The Pixel 3 has dual selfie snappers, but the Lite has only single camera on the front. There is a single speaker and a USB-C port on the bottom edge of the device. The Pixel 3 Lite has a compact appeal which makes it easier to operate with single hand.\nGoogle Pixel 3 Lite Specifications\nThe Pixel 3 Lite (codenamed as Sargo) will be equipped with a 5.56-inch display that supports 18:9 aspect ratio and full HD+ resolution of 2160 x 1080 pixels along with a pixel density of 434 ppi. The Android 9.0 Pie OS will come preinstalled on the smartphone.\nThe Snapdragon 670 SoC with 4 GB of RAM will be driving the Pixel 3 Lite. It has an inbuilt storage of 32 GB. The internal storage of the device is small, but Google will be providing unlimited cloud storage for the buyers of Pixel 3 Lite.\nFor photography, it features OIS enabled single camera of 12.2-megapixel with f/1.8 aperture. As far as image quality is concerned, the source claims that the Pixel 3 Lite can shoot same quality images as the Pixel 3. At the front is a selfie camera of 8-megapixel. It is packed with a 2,915mAh battery.\nGoogle is also expected to debut the bigger Pixel 3 XL Lite along with the Pixel 3 Lite. However, the source did not share any information on the XL Lite variant. As far as the launch of the Pixel 3 Lite is concerned, Google may hold a launch it after the Google I/O 2019 event which is usually held in May.\n(source)"

            "A cargo plane reportedly flying for the logistics giant Amazon has crashed into waters off Houston, Texas. Authorities say three people were on board the Boeing 767 on a two-hour flight from Miami.\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the officials lost radar and radio contact with Atlas Air Flight 3591 about 30 miles (48 kilometers) short of Houston's international airport.\nThe website flightradar24, which tracks plane movements, posted aircraft details , saying the twin-engine freighter was one of a set of Atlas Air Boeing 767 cargo planes operated for Amazon and said it bore the online shopping giant's Prime Air livery.\nAtlas Air said there were three people on board the aircraft. \"Those people and their family members are our top priority at this time,\" the airline said in a statement.\nA local broadcaster KTRK-TV showed footage of a US Coast Guard helicopter hovering over the coastal crash site in Trinity Bay outside Houston.\nWitnesses cited by local Chambers County Sheriff Brian Hawthorne said the freighter's engines surged before the aircraft turned sharply and fell into a nosedive.\nDebris was spread over three-quarters of a mile of marshland, said Hawthorne. \"It's probably a crash that nobody would survive,\" he said.\nAn investigations team had been sent to the crash location, the US National Safety Transportation Board (NSTB) said.\n'Vertical' strategy including drones\nNew York-based Atlas Air , outlining its history on its website, says its arrangement with Amazon is to provide and operate Boeing 767-300 converted freighters to support Amazon's e-commerce business.\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with the flight crew, their families and friends along with the entire team at Atlas Air during this terrible tragedy,\" Dave Clark, senior vice president of worldwide operations at Amazon, said in a statement.\nThe logistics and online shopping giant Amazon launched its Prime Air service in August 2016 using leased aircraft from two cargo aviation providers as part of its so-called \"vertical integration\" strategy that also includes the development of package-carrying drones.\nij/sms (AP, dpa, Reuters)"

            "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Medical officials have determined that two immigrant sisters from Saudi Arabia, whose bodies mysteriously washed up on the New York City waterfront in October, killed themselves.\nTala Farea, 16, and Rotana Farea, 23, \"bound themselves together before descending into the Hudson River.\" Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Barbara Sampson said in a statement Tuesday. The cause of death was drowning.\nTheir fully clothed bodies were discovered Oct. 24 near the river, two months after they were last seen in Fairfax, Virginia, where they had been living in a shelter amid allegations that they were abused at home.\nPolice said the sisters had been in Manhattan since Sept. 1, staying at expensive hotels and ordering in pairs of meals until a credit card they were using maxed out. A jogger said he saw them praying at a playground near the river, sitting about 30 feet (9 meters) apart with their heads in their hands, hours before their bodies were found, police said.\nThe deaths shined a light on the secretive and risky journeys Saudi women take to flee their homes in the kingdom and abroad. Under the kingdom's guardianship system, women must have the approval of a male relative \u2014 such as a father, husband, brother, or even a son \u2014 to marry, obtain a passport or travel.\nNew York City Police Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea said people who knew the Farea sisters in Virginia told investigators that they made statements within the last year indicating \"that they would rather inflict harm on themselves \u2014 commit suicide \u2014 than return to Saudi Arabia.\""

            "In what might mark the first time in history a Change.Org petition has paid off -- even indirectly -- Ole Miss unveiled \"Landshark Tony\" on Saturday. Tony, inspired by the Rebels' famous \"Fins Up\" celebration, came onto the scene with a Twitter account and a photo, and man is he ever a sight to see.\nThere's change, and then there's change.\nThis might be the first mascot to truly give the Pelicans a run for their money in terms of scary appearances and not in an intimidating way. Why is his eye squinting a little? Why are his eyes pitch black? And why oh why is his mask so detailed? His smile is insanely sinister.\nMascots needs a certain amount of whimsy. You don't need your land shark to be an anatomically correct shark. He looks like a rejected design from \"Street Sharks,\" and they were also horrifying.\nTwitter agrees with the sentiment.\nThe story behind Tony is actually pretty endearing. He's an homage to former Ole Miss linebacker Tony Fein, a veteran who served in Iraq and died in 2009. Fein wore the same No. 47 that Landshark Tony will wear. He's credited with starting the \"Fins Up\" celebration. The execution is just extremely questionable.\nTo be fair to Ole Miss, the SEC has a longstanding tradition of not knowing what they are mascot-wise. You can make an argument that sharks are rebels of the sea. The Black Bear was at least named Rebel, so there was a stretch of a connection there.\nOnly one word can really describe this unveiling: yikes."

Despite the backlash, Handler has not apologized or deleted the tweet.\nHandler is the latest in a line of liberal commentators to have come under fire for a joke deemed \u201chomophobic.\u201d\nBILL MAHER ATTACKS LINDSEY GRAHAM FOR DEFENDING KAVANAUGH, SAYS SENATOR NEEDS \u2018HIS DEAD BOYFRIEND\u2019 JOHN MCCAIN\nLast month, HBO\u2019s Bill Maher chided Graham for his defense of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.

            "A 12-year-old girl died on Sunday after the snow fort she was playing in collapsed on her and a 9-year-old friend, the Chicago Tribune reports.\nThe two girls were playing near Rothem Church in Arlington Heights, Ill., while their parents were inside at church services. They dug the fort together in a snowbank, ABC6 reports.\nWhen the girls hadn\u2019t returned about an hour later, the parents went outside and found the collapsed fort, and immediately called for help. The 12-year-old suffered cardiac arrest, and was later pronounced dead. The Cook County Medical Examiner\u2019s office identified her as Esther Jung, a resident of Elk Grove Village.\nA 12-year-old girl reportedly died after the snow fort she was building with a friend collapsed. Pictured above, volunteers in Illinois walk to shovel a main street on Chicago\u2019s south side. (Photo: John J. Kim/Chicago Tribune/TNS)\nThe 9-year-old girl was treated for hypothermia, and remains in an area hospital. According to Sgt. Charles Buczynski, she is expected to survive.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a tragic accident,\u201d Buczynski said. The Tribune reported it was about 14 degrees in Arlington Heights while the girls were outside. Last year, a 12-year-old Canadian girl died when a snow fort collapsed on her.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics warns about hypothermia, frostbite, and injuries commonly incurred while sledding, skating, skiing, snowboarding, or snowmobiling. However, they don\u2019t provide any information on snow fort collapses.\n\u201cIt is totally understandable that kids would want to play and make forts and tunnels in the biggest pile of snow they can find, and the biggest pile of snow is probably where the trucks are dumping it,\u201d Kyran Quinlan, M.D., MPH, associate professor and section director of General Pediatrics at Rush University Children\u2019s Hospital in Chicago, told Parents.com. \u201cTo reduce the risk, municipalities could do what they can to make sure that no children are playing in the places where trucks are dumping snow that is removed. And families can try to guide children to avoid playing anywhere near where the trucks are dumping the snow.\u201d\nDespite the tragic circumstances, experts say it\u2019s no reason to discourage children from playing outside and enjoying the winter season. \u201cThe vast majority of kids who build snow forts and tunnels will be safe,\u201d he added. \u201cI hope this event is not seen as a reason to stay inside in the winter, or not dig and play in the snow.\u201d\nStory continues\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day."

            "Follow us on Image Source : INSTAGRAM Tanushree Dutta decides to file FIR against filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri\nThe flagbearer of #MeToo movement in India, Tanushree Dutta, has already taken the legal route to fight out her battle with Nana Patekar and filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri. While veteran actor Nana Patekar has denied all the allegations against him, filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri has finally confessed to the molestation charges weeks after he slapped her with a notice of referring him while accusing him of sexually harassing her during the shoot of the 2005 film Chocolate: Deep Dark Secrets.\nTanushree Dutta\u2019s counsel, Nitin Satpute told a leading daily that Tanushree Dutta never pressed any charges against Agnihotri at the press conference. According to the reports, the director had asked Tanushree to strip off her clothes and dance to give cues to an actor, all this, behind the camera. Satpute further told the daily that it was the director who confessed to the crimes in a 10-page notice that he sent to Tanushree where he stated that \u2018the director was none other than me.\u2019 He further stated that since the director has himself owned up to the crime and they will be submitting an official complaint against him at the Oshiwara police station requesting the cops to press molestation charges against him.\nAlong with Nana Patekar, Tanushree has accused three more of sexual harassment and now have even filed a case against Rakhi Sawant who tried to threaten Dutta and said \u2018Tujhse to main niptungi...Ghar me ghus ke marungi.\u2019 (I will deal with you and beat you inside your house). Talking about the same, Satpute, also a member of the Bhim Army stated that they have submitted a complaint letter at the Oshiwara Police station and requested the cops to register the case under SC/ST Atrocity Act. He also stated that they (Bhim Army) will file an FIR against Sawant.\nReiterating her decade-old harassment allegations against Nana Patekar, Tanushree said earlier that such cases are not taken seriously in India but she is confident that she will get justice. She said, \"I am hoping I will get justice. But not figured out what kind of justice I will get. There are rules and regulations, things are tweaked and twisted and there is corruption so justice gets delayed.\u201d\nMore Bollywood stories and picture galleries\nFor all latest news and updates, stay tuned to our Facebook page\nLatest Entertainment News"

            "The Communist Party leader said the proposed changes mean that people will get their \"pension in their coffins.\u201d The proposal to increase the pension age is widely unpopular.\nTens of thousands of protesters rallied across Russia on Saturday against a proposal to increase the state pension age.\nMore than 10,000 people took part in a protest in Moscow organized by the Communist Party, trade unions and left-wing groups. Dozens of other demonstrations were held in cities and towns across the country.\nRead more: Russians outraged by pension reform plan\nThe proposal would hike the pension age from 60 to 65 for men and from 55 to 63 for women by 2034.\nThe cabinet put forward the measure just before the start of the World Cup, a move critics said was designed to avoid attention while the public was distracted.\nThe lower-house of parliament, the Duma, has given a first reading approval and its set to continue discussing the bill in September.\nLife expectancy in Russia has risen from around 65 in 2003 to 72 years in 2016, according to the World Bank. The government argues that increasing life expectancy puts pressure on the pension system.\nThe Communist Party is often compliant with the ruling party. Not this time. Image: picture-alliance/ZUMA Wire/A. Sukhorukov\nBut many people worry that they will not live to receive their pensions. Life expectancy for men is only 67 compared to 77 for women.\nCommunist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov told the Moscow rally that with Russian men dying in their 60s \"they will all get their pension in their coffins.\"\n\"It's not a reform, but a crime against the nation,\" he told supporters.\n\"If the retirement age is increased, every citizen of Russia will be robbed for more than $16,000 (\u20ac13,700) and it is unacceptable,\" left-wing activist Sergei Udaltsov said at the Moscow demonstration.\nSergei Udaltsov, leader of the Red Youth Avantguard movement, accused the government of attempted robbery. Image: picture-alliance/dpa/M. Voskresenskiy\nOpposition leader Alexei Navalny wrote on his blog that the aim of the reform \"is to rob the public.\" He has called on his supporters to attend a rally on Sunday in Moscow.\nOpponents are demanding a referendum be held on the measure and the fall of the government if the pension reform passes.\nRead more: Me and the cop: Pussy Riot releases new protest song\nThe outpouring of opposition against a measure backed by President Vladimir Putin's ruling party is rare. Nearly 3 million people have signed a petition against the pension reform.\nPutin had previously vowed not to increase the pension age and now many people feel betrayed. Putin said last week that he did not want to raise the pension age but taking no action was not possible. \"We will have to take some crucial decisions,\" he said.\n\"Many believed Putin when he said there would be no pension reform. It turns out that was demagoguery. I'm very disappointed in him,\" protester Irina Ivanova, 49, told AFP news agency in Saint Petersburg.\nAccording to state pollster VTsIOM, public trust in the president has fallen to 64 percent this month compared to 80 percent in May.\nSeparately, the upper-house of parliament on Saturday passed a proposal to increase the value-added tax by two percent to 20 percent. The vote is the last step before being signed into law.\ncw/bw (AFP, AP, dpa)"

            "Patrick Patterson spoke at the 2018 OKC Thunder Media Day emphasizing his excitement over year two and his revised role.\nLast season Patrick Patterson accepted an economical contract in free agency to come play with the OKC Thunder. From the start the move wasn\u2019t quite what the forward or the franchise expected. Patterson underwent offseason knee surgery setting him back immediately. For a player who tends to take time to ease into the season the surgery only served to enhance those issues.\nThe larger issue was Patterson joined the OKC Thunder believing he would be the starting power forward. Aside from the injury, this idea was derailed with a last minute trade to obtain Carmelo Anthony. Seemingly, Patterson never found his true groove and while his shot improved late in the season he was relegated to the reserve unit.\nEntering his second season with the Thunder he\u2019ll once again have the opportunity to join the starters. Although there will be competition from Jerami Grant for this spot in the rotation Patterson\u2019s ability to spread the floor might give him the edge.\nPer Game Table Season Tm G MP FGA FG% 3P 3PA 3P% 2P% eFG% FTA FT% ORB DRB TRB AST STL BLK PTS 2014-15 TOR 81 26.6 6.6 .449 1.3 3.5 .371 .536 .547 1.0 .788 1.6 3.8 5.3 1.9 0.7 0.5 8.0 2015-16 TOR 79 25.6 6.2 .414 1.3 3.7 .362 .490 .521 0.4 .853 1.0 3.4 4.3 1.2 0.7 0.4 6.9 2016-17 TOR 65 24.6 5.9 .401 1.4 3.9 .372 .458 .523 0.9 .717 1.0 3.6 4.5 1.2 0.6 0.4 6.8 2017-18 OKC 82 15.5 3.2 .398 0.8 2.1 .386 .421 .523 0.6 .870 0.4 2.0 2.4 0.7 0.6 0.3 3.9 Career 559 22.7 6.4 .455 0.9 2.3 .370 .502 .521 0.8 .757 1.3 3.0 4.3 1.1 0.6 0.5 7.3 View Original Table\nGenerated 9/23/2018. Provided by Basketball-Reference.com Generated 9/23/2018.\nAsked about how he will deal with the up tempo pace being discussed for this season:\n\u2018Just about trying to get the basketball from one side to the other, get the basketball up court as quickly as possible with my passing ability. Being able to find guys out on the court, not necessarily literally pushing in transition or having to shoot the ball. But just trying to find the right opportunity for a teammate to take advantage of.\nWhether it\u2019s off a drive or a quick post up or just passing it that leads an assist or another opportunity for a shot. I can understand coach wants to get more shots earlier in the shot clock or just trying to find better opportunities for us early in the shot clock and that in turn will create more looks throughout the cross of the game and give us an opportunity to put up more points.\u2019\nAsked how he feels about playing more at the four:\nPatterson says he\u2019s played both positions throughout his life. Patterson notes with the game being faster it\u2019s more important to move your feet and be able to defend. He notes the most important thing is being able to rebound, play defense and switch out on screens. In essence he\u2019s comfortable playing at the four or five.\nThoughts on Paul George\u2018s return:\nPatrick noted he had no idea whether Paul would return, but felt confident based on the camaraderie between George and Westbrook and overall team chemistry.\nDo you want to be the starting four this season?\nHe admits he would like to start, but will do whatever the team feels fits best, noting he wants to provide a positive wherever he plays (starter or reserve). When queried more on him starting given his three point shot efficiency he did speak to being able to do it, but was quick to not Jerami (Grant) did well and he suspects he improved this summer.\nThis will be Patterson\u2019s ninth season as a pro and as such makes him one of the longer tenured players on the staff. With the loss of Nick Collison there is a hole left in terms of veteran voices.\nPatterson is familiar with helping in that regard having worked closely with the youngsters in Toronto and should be able to provide quality mentoring in OKC."

            "Fernando Alonso (right) is ninth in the drivers' championship with Daniel Ricciardo fifth\nFernando Alonso wants Red Bull to apologise after they denied his claim they offered him a drive for 2019.\nThe 37-year-old said Red Bull approached him about the seat being vacated by Daniel Ricciardo, who is joining Renault.\nBut two-time world champion Alonso has since said he would be leaving Formula 1 at the end of the season, with Pierre Gasly moving to Red Bull instead.\n\"It was not the case for me to join this adventure,\" said Alonso.\nRed Bull team boss Christian Horner said the team \"offered Fernando a contract in the past but that was back in 2007\".\nEarlier this week, Red Bull motorsport boss Helmut Marko said Alonso \"doesn't fit with us\" and told Red Bull's Servus TV station: \"We were negotiating with him in 2007 or 2008. His demands were very tedious back then.\n\"If you look at his history, in McLaren and Ferrari, it was always a one-man show.\"\nHowever, Alonso later claimed he had offers from Red Bull six times in his career.\n\"I had a couple of offers from Red Bull,\" Alonso told Sky F1. \"In fact I had one in 2007, in 2009, in 2011, 2013, and two this year, one in Monaco, and one in August.\n\"The comments of Christian Horner this summer and Mr Marko are completely out of context, surprise comments about me creating chaos and being a difficult man to work with.\n\"One, they never worked with me, and secondly they've been chasing me for five or six occasions in the last seven years, and now they say that, that they are loyal to their programme and their commitments and their junior drivers.\n\"It has been weird, it has been unfair to me. I wrote to Christian after his comments this summer, he apologised by email, and hopefully he'll apologise again this weekend.\"\nBut Horner, speaking on Friday, again insisted no offer had been made to the Spaniard for 2019.\n\"To be totally clear, there was no offer to Fernando Alonso for next year,\" said Horner.\n\"He is a fantastic driver and a great talent, he has chosen his path. We had an inquiry from Flavio Briatore and from Liberty Media but the position within Red Bull has always been very clear.\n\"We invest in youth and have a talent pool through the Red Bull junior programme and as has been the case with Sebastian Vettel, (Daniil) Kvyat, (Daniel) Ricciardo and Max Verstappen, we were always going to draw on the talent we have.\"\nFernando Alonso has nine more races in his Formula 1 career\nAlonso is looking at other categories of motorsport as he seeks to complete the unofficial \"triple crown\".\nThis is widely regarded to be victories in the Monaco Grand Prix, the Le Mans 24 Hours and the Indy 500, although some say the F1 world title rather than Monaco. Either way, only Graham Hill has ever achieved the feat.\nAlonso added victory in the Le Mans 24 Hours this year with Toyota, for whom he is leading the World Endurance Championship this season in addition to his F1 commitments with McLaren, and led 27 of the 200 laps on a one-off attempt at the Indy 500 last year before retiring in the closing stages with engine failure.\nAlonso did not confirm he would race in IndyCar next year, but said: \"The triple crown is something I have been saying for a couple of years now.\n\"To be the best driver in the world there are two possibilities: winning eight world championships - quite unlikely now for me - and the second is to taste different series and different cars.\n\"In sports cars I am doing OK. On the Indy 500, I felt competitive last year and there are other series that can put you in a different level in motorsport.\"\nAlonso said he did not expect to return to F1.\n\"Right now, I am thinking it is goodbye,\" he said. \"Life changes very quickly. I don't have a crystal ball to know what will happen. For me, it is bye-bye, but who knows in the future?\"\nBut he said he might have stayed in F1 had he had a winning car.\n\"The possibilities for next year, there have been few, or a lot - depends on how you look at it,\" Alonso added. \"I did not stay because there are only two teams that can win and they continue with their drivers for the following years.\n\"And the F1 we see now is not the F1 I dreamed of when I was a kid or when I started in 2001.\n\"When you come to the same place for so many years and repeat the same thing, it is easier to be not so emotional about the challenges and that is the reason now.\"\nThe second Ferrari seat alongside Sebastian Vettel is the only place at the top two teams that has not been announced at this stage but Alonso's remarks seem to confirm the increasing impression in F1 that Kimi Raikkonen will be retained.\nFerrari had been planning before the sudden death of former president Sergio Marchionne last month to promote Monegasque Charles Leclerc from Sauber, but the new management is said to have had a rethink.\nTribute from Hamilton\nLewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso were both at McLaren in 2007 and both finished on 109 points, one less than world champion Kimi Raikkonen\nLewis Hamilton paid tribute to Alonso as \"one of the best drivers ever\" in Formula 1, following the Spaniard's decision to retire.\nAlonso, twice a world champion and sixth in the all-time win list with 32 victories, announced last week that he would leave Formula 1 at the end of the season.\nSpeaking before this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix, Hamilton said: \"It is a shame he is not as decorated as his ability [deserves].\n\"But sport is not just about being a good driver, it's how you play the game, how you position yourself.\"\nAlonso has famously made a series of poor career decisions, including turning down a chance to join Red Bull in time for their domination of the early 2010s, and leaving Ferrari at the end of 2014 believing they would never produce a competitive car.\nHamilton, who was Alonso's team-mate at McLaren in 2007 when they tied on points and number of wins, added: \"He has been arguably the best driver I have ever driven against and I wish him all the best.\"\nWhy Ricciardo went to Renault\nPierre Gasly (left) will race for Red Bull in 2019 with Daniel Ricciardo joining Renault\nAlonso's decision was one of a series of driver moves announced over the summer break, which ends with the Belgian Grand Prix this weekend.\nThe other big news was Ricciardo's decision to leave Red Bull at the end of the season and join Renault.\nHe said: \"It was by no means an easy decision. It got to a point when I felt I was ready for a change and a new challenge, just some fresh motivation.\n\"It sounds easy saying it like that but it wasn't easy. There were a few sleepless nights but once I made the decision I feel comfortable with it.\"\nRicciardo admitted that Renault, who are fourth this season after 12 races but a long way off Red Bull's pace, would not be in a position to win next year but said he was confident in their ability to do so in the future.\n\"Their short to medium-term plan is encouraging,\" the Australian said. \"What they're doing with their finances and the way they are doing it showed me they want to win.\n\"I saw some really good signs with what they showed me in their presentation, and also their honesty - not telling me they are going to win in Melbourne [the first race next year]. It is a process but one going forward pretty rapidly.\"\nHow to follow on BBC Sport\nBBC Sport has live coverage of all the season's races on BBC Radio 5 live and BBC Radio 5 live sports extra, plus live online commentary on the BBC Sport website and mobile app - including audience interaction, expert analysis, debate, voting, features, interviews and video content.\nAll times BST and are subject to change at short notice."

That stretch is capped by a four game homestand that includes LeBron James\u2019 first visit to Orlando as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers on November 17.\nThe 30th season for the Magic will kick off on October 17th, when they host the Miami Heat.\nMark your calendar!

In three of those back-to-backs, the Magic will be home for both games.\nThe Magic will have a pair of six-game road trips during the season, with the first starting on Nov. 23 at Denver and another beginning on New Year\u2019s Eve against Charlotte. The Magic\u2019s longest homestand is five games, which comes towards the end of the season, starting off against Cleveland on March 14 and spanning 12 days.\nIt was originally reported that both Magic games in Mexico City in mid-December would be televised on ESPN, but the games are not currently listed on the network\u2019s national television NBA schedule. The Magic will however have their season finale at Charlotte broadcasted on ESPN for some strange reason.

            "This is a carousel. Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate\nA limousine crash that claimed the lives of 20 people in New York on Saturday became the deadliest land-vehicle accident since 2005, when 23 Bellaire nursing home residents died in a fiery bus while evacuating Hurricane Rita, according to the Associated Press.\nRELATED: Settlement over Hurricane Rita bus fire brings closure\nSaturday's crash was also the deadliest overall transportation accident in nearly a decade. It killed two pedestrians and 18 limo occupants on the way to a birthday party, including sisters, brothers and newlyweds.\nThe tragedy likely hits home for the family members of the 23 Bellaire nursing home resident who were riding in the bus that caught fire 35 miles from its destination in Dallas.\nThe bus was one of two ordered by the Brighton Gardens nursing home during Hurricane Rita, according to previous reports. Residents were evacuating to a sister facility in Dallas on Sept. 23, 2005.\nThe bus was carrying 37 patients, six health care workers and one staffer's relative when it caught fire on Interstate 45. One survivor told the Houston Chronicle that the fire department pulled him out before the bus \"blew up like a Roman candle.\"\nAuthorities later said the bus exploded when the flames reached one passenger's oxygen tank.\nAfter the fire, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration determined the bus's rear axle overheated and caused a fire in the wheel well that quickly filled the bus. The agency said the likely cause was insufficient lubrication of the rear axle, earlier reports state.\nRELATED: Schoharie limo crash deadliest in US in nine years\nThe families of the victims later sued the nursing home's corporate parent, claiming the company and its bus broker failed to screen the the vehicle before contracting with them.\nYears later, the families reached an $80 million settlement with the nursing home and several parties involved in designing, manufacturing and operating the bus.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just helping us have closure,\u201d Susan Elledge, whose mother and aunt both died aboard the bus, told the Houston Chronicle in 2009. \u201cI hope the companies involved will change the way they do things. Do a little more towards safety on the buses.\u201d\nIn Saturday's crash, the 2001 Ford Excursion limo was traveling about 170 miles north of New York City in Schoharie when it failed to stop at a T-junction on a state highway, the Associated Press reported. It hit two pedestrians and an unoccupied SUV parked at the Apple Barrel Country Store.\nIt then slammed into an embankment, killing all occupants.\nText CHRON to 77453 to receive breaking news alerts by text message.\nJulian Gill is a digital reporter in Houston.

            "The Miami Dolphins are back in South Florida today as they welcome the Oakland Raiders to Hard Rock Stadium. This Week 3 contest features Miami looking to move to 3-0 on the season, while the Raiders are hoping to avoid an 0-3 start.\nThe Dolphins were last in Hard Rock Stadium in Week 1, when they beat the Tennessee Titans in the longest game ever played in the NFL. The game featured two different lightning delays that pushed the game to over seven hours from kickoff to the final whistle. This week\u2019s game will (hopefully) be shorter than that one, though there are thunderstorms forecasted for the area during the game.\nWe will update the action throughout the game below. You can keep up with everything here, and you can join a live chat with other Dolphins fans by heading over to our live thread.\nFirst Quarter:\nCoin Toss: Dolphins won the toss and deferred to the second half. Raiders will get the ball first.\nRaiders first possession: Robert Quinn and Cameron Wake nearly get to Derek Carr on the first play, with the quarterback just throwing the ball away to avoid a sack. Jordy Nelson caught the short slant on second down and there were no Dolphins players anywhere near him as he took the ball 71 yards to the Miami 14-yard line. After a short run from Marshawn Lynch, Carr looked to Nelson again for the 12-yard touchdown.\nRaiders 7-0.\nDolphins first possession: Ryan Tannehill connected with Kenyan Drake for a one-yard gain on the dump off on first down. Drake then carried the ball out of a two-running back set on second down, picking up three. On 3rd-and-6, Miami looked down the sideline for Kenny Still, but the pass was broken up and Miami punted on the three-and-out.\nRaiders second possession: Weirdness on the punt return, as Matt Haack kicked the ball 59 yards, then as it bounced, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie picked it up and tried to return it, losing one yard down to the Raiders\u2019 eight-yard line. An illegal block in the back penalty added to the play takes the Raiders back to their own four-yard line. Carr then threw a quick pass out to the left with Martavis Bryant, but that was backed up again taking the Raiders to the two-yard line after another block in the back. Lynch was able to bounce outside and break a couple of tackles to pick up nine yards on the run, making it 2nd-and-3. Another Lynch run picked up a yard, giving Oakland a 3rd-and-2 from the Miami 13. A play action fake to Lynch, with a completion to Arami Cooper picked up the first down with a nine-yard gain. Doug Martin got the next first-down carry, picking up four yards. Then, Miami again decided to let Nelson do whatever he wanted, picking up 66 yards and getting the ball all the way down to the Miami yard line. The Raiders got the ball down to the Miami one-yard line, but the Dolphins defense stiffened and held on fourth down.\nDolphins second possession: After offsetting penalties on the fourth-down attempt, Miami started at their own one-yard line. Frank Gore picked up two yards, but a penalty on second down - a penalty that should have been on the Raiders who clearly jumped first but was called on Ja\u2019Wuan James - Miami was backed up to their own two-yard line for second down. Gore picked up no yards on the next play, then Tannehill dropped back into the end zone and could not find anyone, so he scrambled to his left to pick up the first down. After a six-yard pass to Kenny Stills, Drake lost four yards, then Tannehill found DeVante Parker for four yards and the team had to punt.\nRaiders third possession: On first down, Carr rolled to his right, was flushed by Cameron Wake, then stepped up and bombed a ball down the field looking for Cooper. The throw was into triple coverage, and Xavien Howard picked it off, returning it 39 yards.\nDolphins third possession: Miami would do nothing with the ball on the possession, being backed up by a holding penalty on Jakeem Grant on first down. They would pick up just four yards, three on a Drake run and one on a Mike Gesicki reception, before punting.\nRaiders fourth possession: On the punt return, the ball appeared to be about to be downed by Walt Aikens at about the two-yard line when he was shoved in the back and the ball rolled into the end zone. The penalty, however, backed the Raiders up to their own one-yard line, only to have the quarter end on a nine-yard run from Martin.\nEnd 1st Quarter. Raiders 7-0.\nSecond Quarter.\nRaiders fourth possession (continued): On second down after the break, Martin lost two yards with William Hayes making the tackle for a loss. On the third-down play, Hayes then sacked Carr at the Raiders two-yard line, but immediately started grabbing for his knee and was in clear pain. He was able to walk off the field, but was heading straight to the locker room.\nDolphins fourth possession: Miami started with the ball at the Oakland 35 after a short punt from the Raiders. Gore picked up no yards on the first-down run, then added one yard on second down. On 3rd-and-9, Tannehill found Kenny Stills in the back of the end zone for a 34-yard touchdown pass.\nTouchdown!!!\n34 yards Tannehill to Stills!! pic.twitter.com/fvcD7YTck1 \u2014 Kevin Nogle (@thephinsider) September 23, 2018\nTied 7-7.\nRaiders fifth possession: Carr found Nelson for 12 yards, marking the first time the Dolphins did not have to chase Nelson halfway down the field. After an incomplete pass, Bryant was able to pick up four yards on the end-around. Carr was sacked on third down, with Cameron Wake finally getting to the quarterback, only to have Akeem Spence get called for unnecessary roughness after the play, leading to a first-down for the Raiders and Spence\u2019s ejection. The defense tackle appeared to grab a Raiders\u2019 player\u2019s facemark after the play, then when he tripped, he ripped the helmet off the player, then swung it and hit another player. Lynch picked up five yards, then Carr found Jalen Richard for nine yards. Lynch ran the ball the next three plays, picking up 10 total yards, before Carr found Dwayne Harris for seven yards. Martin ran for one yard before Cook picked up 13 yards and pushed to 1st-and-Goal at the Dolphins\u2019 seven-yard line. Lynch picked up five yards to get to the Dolphins\u2019 two, then Carr threw away a pass as he was pressured. After a Miami timeout, the Raiders were called for a false start, backing Oakland back to Miami\u2019s seven-yard line. After no gain on a screen pass to Lynch, the Raiders settled for a field goal.\nRaiders 10-7.\nDolphins fifth possession: Miami started the next drive with a 13-yard slant to Danny Amendola. Tannehill found A.J. Derby on the next play for 16 yards. Then he found Kenny Stills for 21 yards as the clock hit the two-minute warning. The refs decided the drive should be over after that. However, as Tannehill found Wilson for 14-yards, only to have a pancake block from Daniel Kilgore get called for holding. Then, after Gesicki made an incredible grab as he was being cut down from behind, Tannehill found Gore for 12 yards, getting to the Raiders\u2019 13 yard line, but the refs decided that Stills being hit by a linebacker was somehow offensive pass interference and backed up Miami to the Oakland 35. After a sack on Tannehill on 3rd down, Miami punted.\nRaiders sixth possession: Two kneel downs led to halftime.\nHalf-time. Raiders 10-7.\nSign up HERE to take our weekly Dolphins survey.\nThird quarter.\nDolphins receive the ball to start the second half.\nDolphins sixth possession: Miami started the possession with a 10-yard pick up from Albert Wilson, only to have Grant called for Offensive Pass Interference for a replay of the down and a ten-yard loss. Now facing 1st-and-20 at their own 13, Miami saw Gore pick up three yards on a run, then Tannehill could not find anyone open so he dumped it to Drake for six yards. After an incomplete pass, the Dolphins punted.\nRaiders seventh possession: Carr found Cooper for eight yards on the first play. Then looked deep on second down, but dumped it to Lynch for another eight-yard gain. Lynch picked up two yards on the next play, pushing just across midfield and into Miami territory. After a delay of game backed up the Raiders, Carr found Harris for five yards, then Bryant for 11 yards. Martin picked up six yards on a carry on 1st-and-10 from the Miami 39-yard line. Lynch then added five yards, then seven yards. Carr the found Keith Smith for two yards. Lynch lost two yards, but Carr found Richard for 12 yards to set up 1st-and-Goal at the eight. After a replay overturned a touchdown and set up 3rd-and-Goal from inside the one, the Raiders would score on a Lynch leap over the pile.\nRaiders 17-7.\nDolphins seventh possession: Miami found a little rhythm as they got the ball back. Tannehill connected with Amendola for 15 yards on first down, then found Parker for 36 yards down the sideline. After Drake picked up one yard at the Oakland 19-yard line, Tannehill threw a shovel pass to Jakeem Grant who turned the corner and scored the 18-yard touchdown.\nBeautiful shovel pass to Grant who does the work for the score!\npic.twitter.com/D92jfeJugB \u2014 Kevin Nogle (@thephinsider) September 23, 2018\nRaiders 17-14.\nRaiders eighth possession: Carr found Nelson for six yards, but then threw incomplete on second down and saw Xavien Howard break up the third-down pass to Cooper. Oakland punted.\nEnd of third quarter. Raiders 17-14.\nDolphins eighth possession: The Dolphins tried a draw play on first down, but barely got back to the line of scrimmage. On second down, Tannehill found Mike Gesicki for a 19 yard gain. Tannehill looked deep on first down, but the pass to Parker was broken up by Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. Wilson carried the ball on an end-around, but did not pick up any yards. After an offsides penalty on the Raiders moved the ball from 3rd-and-10 to 3rd-and-5, Tannehill was incomplete on a tipped pass intended for Drake and Miami had to punt.\nRaiders ninth possession: The Raiders almost saw their possession disappear as Nelson muffed the punt but Walt Aikens was just a step too far from the ball and Nelson managed to get it back. Lynch then picked up eight yards on first down then three on second down. On the next first down, Carr threw incomplete before Vincent Taylor sacked him for a five-yard loss on second down. On 3rd-and-15, the Fitzpatrick and McTyer were able to hit Bryant short of the first down, but they bounced off each other and the receiver converted the first down with a 19-yard gain. Martin picked up three yards on the next play, followed by no gain for Lynch, then an incomplete pass toward Cooper. Oakland would punt.\nDolphins ninth possession: Tannehill scrambled for 18 yards on first down. Then, on second down, the Dolphins went to the trick plays, with Tannehill handing the ball to Gore, who was coming from the offense\u2019s right to the left. Then Gore flipped the ball to Albert Wilson, who was coming on a sweep, then stopped and threw a pass to Grant, who was wide open down the right side of the field. Miami took their first lead on the 52-yard pass.\nTannehill + Gore + Wilson + Grant = 6! pic.twitter.com/1Pdu1o6irJ \u2014 Kevin Nogle (@thephinsider) September 23, 2018\nDolphins 21-17.\nRaiders tenth possession: Oakland started at their own ten-yard line after an illegal block penalty on the kickoff return. On first down, Carr looked to Bryant, with T.J. McDonald nearly coming away with the interception before the ball hit the ground. On second down, Lynch picked up seven yards, setting up a 3rd-and-3 with Hard Rock Stadium getting loud. Torry McTyer was called for pass interference on the conversion attempt, giving the Raiders a first down. Martin picked up one yard on the first down run. Carr then found Nelson for 16 yards, then, after an incomplete pass, Carr found Mynch for 14 yards. Martin then picked up 15 yards, followed by 6 yards. After a 12-man-on-the-field penalty on Miami, Carr looked deep to the end zone for Bryant, only to have Xavien Howard pick off his second pass of the game.\nDolphins tenth possession: Gore picked up six yards on first down, then Tannehill threw a shovel pass to Albert Wilson, who went 74 yards for the touchdown.\nDolphins 28-17.\nRaiders eleventh possession: Oakland started with a seven yard pass to Richard, then a three yard pass to Cook.

            "This story has been updated with new information. The State of Michigan offices are closed Wednesday because of extremely cold temperatures.\nLANSING \u2014 As Michigan braces for an extremely cold Wednesday, the state remains under a state of emergency declared Monday by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\nDeclaring an emergency was meant to encourage Michigan residents to take cold weather warnings seriously, Whitmer said Tuesday during a tour of Cristo Rey Community Center in north Lansing. Cristo Rey is also a warming center for Lansing.\nState emergency response teams are also working with municipalities during the state of emergency, though Whitmer declined to elaborate on what resources would be available to help local communities keep their residents warm.\nHere's what else you need to know about the declaration:\nThe State Emergency Operations Center is open\nThe Michigan State Police headquarters in Dimondale is the State Emergency Operations Center, where troopers work with Emergency Management and Homeland Security teams to coordinate response efforts, center spokesman Dale George said.\nUnder an emergency, the state could provide communities access to things like equipment, manpower and money if they run out of their own, George said. An emergency declaration cuts the amount of paperwork needed to access those state resources, he said.\nNo communities had requested help as of late Tuesday morning.\nLocal leaders are not sure what it means\nLansing Mayor Andy Schor, who attended Whitmer's tour of Cristo Rey, said he hopes the state will be able to provide funding the city can use to reimburse shelters that are operating above capacity during the cold weather.\n\"We are going to find out if that's part of the state of emergency,\" Schor said. \"We most definitely need it.\"\nNo one will be turned away from a shelter, Schor said.\nIn a Tuesday press release, Ingham County emergency providers said there is \"some confusion regarding the Governor's request for a State of Emergency.\"\n\"That is a formality the state needs to do in order to transfer resources between different responders at the state level,\" the release states. \"That will not force businesses to close or restrict driving.\"\nAt Cristo Rey, the need is ongoing\nCristo Rey serves about 100 meals per day, offers mental and physical health care and operates food and hygiene pantries and gives away free clothes. It is open during the weekdays, Executive Director Joe Garcia said.\nBut the center should be open seven days a week and have more social workers who can help clients find the public services they need, he said.\nMore funding would help Cristo Rey serve more people, but the need \"is ongoing,\" Garcia said, and not addressed through the emergency declaration.\nState workers: No work Wednesday\nLate Wednesday, Gov. Whitmer announced State of Michigan offices would be closed because of the cold weather. Nonessential workers were asked to stay home.\nState offices in Michigan's lower peninsula also closed Monday morning amid the snowstorm, but only after most had already made their morning commutes.\nState workers returned to their desks Tuesday.\nMore:How much should you tip for food delivery in a blizzard? Here's what local workers say.\nIf you think it's cold this week, it's nothing compared to past years in Michigan\nVideo: Time lapse drive to the Capitol during Lansing snowstorm\nVideo: Weather fun: 10 cool facts about snow that may surprise you\nContact Carol Thompson at (517) 377-1018 or ckthompson@lsj.com.

        "label": "Kareena Kapoor in Veere Di Wedding",
        "articles": [
            "Veere Di Wedding is centred on four close friends \u2013 Kalindi (Kareena Kapoor Khan), Avni (Sonam Kapoor), Sakshi (Swara Bhaskar), and Meera (Shikha Talsania) \u2013 who are caught in varying degrees of confusion and trouble. Kalindi is about to get married to Rishabh (Sumeeet Vyas), a guy she\u2019s been dating for three years, but she\u2019s not sure. She loves him and he loves her too, she says, but what does that have to do with marriage? Avni, a lawyer, is constantly pressurised by her mother (Neena Gupta) to get married. Sakshi is about to divorce her husband and, for the same reason, doesn\u2019t get along with her parents. Meera, the mother of a two-year-old boy, is happily married to an American, living a content life, but she hasn\u2019t spoken to her uncle, her long-time guardian, in years. This bunch is meeting after long, in Delhi, for Kalindi\u2019s wedding.\nHindi films haven\u2019t had a long history of female ensembles. Of late though, a few films, such as Angry Indian Goddesses, Parched, and Lipstick Under My Burkha, have bucked that trend. These films, barring Angry Indian Goddess\u2019 awful climax, have been entertaining and intense, but it wasn\u2019t hard to gauge that they for various reasons, either due to astute marketing or straightjacketed expectations, were primarily projected and seen as \u2018feminist\u2019 dramas \u2013 the implication being that a movie with an all-female cast had to be \u2018something\u2019, that it couldn\u2019t be itself, a film like any other trying to tell an entertaining story. To be fair, those films were label friendly to an extent, with their plots and resolutions clearly feminist in nature.\n\ufeff\nVeere Di Wedding, however, is a much simpler film \u2013 if you want to be blunt, you can call it a much dumber film. Here the protagonists are privileged and shallow, their engagement with the world is limited to failed relationships. That may sound like a demerit, but it also frees the film from the baggage of ideology and representation, allowing it to find its way. And when Veere Di Wedding does find its way, when it is at its finest, it brings the house down.\nSakshi is, by far, the most rambunctious of the lot. Perpetually smoking cigarettes or downing drinks, she has little regard for propriety. Bhaskar, who usually plays hard-hitting characters, slips into this role with ease and seems to be having a lot of fun. Her Sakshi is what most good characters are: consistent, compelling, unpredictable. Even Kalindi and Meera (Talsania is wonderful) are well-written characters. (#SpoilerAlert: Sonam Kapoor still can\u2019t act and threatens to ruin the movie every time she\u2019s in the frame).\nThe joy of watching Veere Di Wedding is the joy of watching several firsts. It feels liberating to see female characters just be in a Bollywood drama. Unlike most films, here their conversations don\u2019t revolve around men. In fact, some of them hide things from each other. Early in the film, Sakshi is in her car, berating her parents over the phone. When Meera enters the car, asking who was on the phone, Sakshi replies, \u201cOh nothing, Airtel.\u201d\nThen much later Meera, while vacationing in Phuket with her friends, reveals an embarrassing personal detail of her life. Many scenes in Veere Di Wedding have an infectious, life-like quality to them, like eavesdropping on a conversation among close friends. Scenes often flow in and out of each other easily. The characters and their conversations, as a result, aren\u2019t substitutes for ideologies.\nVeere Di Wedding accumulates its victories slowly. They are in scenes where an expensive wedding dress \u2013 or the wedding itself \u2013 isn\u2019t an end in itself, in bits where Meera gets annoyed by her son (motherhood cannot vanquish your own self), in portions where Kalindi derides the marriage\u2019s patriarchal norms. This should be the default level for such a ginormous and profitable film industry, but Bollywood is particularly slow to change, so even basic efforts seem path breaking.\nA film that makes you laugh \u2013 and Veere Di Wedding does that a lot till its first half \u2013 becomes easy to like. So when its flaws start to appear to the point that they threaten to outsize its merits, it causes more disappointment than usual. Veere Di Wedding revels in its comedic strains, but sometimes it tries too hard, and the outcome is silly and contrived. For instance, it\u2019s one thing to show Sakshi as a chain smoker, it\u2019s quite the other to show her with a cigarette all the time (even inside a mall). Similarly, Khan, who is otherwise fine in the film, has a tendency to act for the camera, making funny, exasperated expressions even when she\u2019s by herself. Neena Gupta\u2019s character, too, overdoes her marriage fixation. Since Veere Di Wedding is primarily a comedy, it is always looking to milk any funny scenario, but such efforts, when not backed by credible writing, start looking trite. What\u2019s worse: their triteness is easily evident.\nThe film is particularly weak in its final segment, when it tries to give some shape \u2013 an overarching sense of seriousness \u2013 to this freewheeling drama. These scenes, dealing with different familial misunderstandings \u2013 between a father and a daughter, an uncle and a niece, two brothers \u2013 should have been well written, showing how family dynamics can be complex, fluctuating, and even absurd at times.\nInstead we get plot turns that seem too convenient and neat, rushing to wrap up the film. Besides, the individual outcomes of the characters\u2019 stories, which more or less confirm the status quo, are disappointing. Veere Di Wedding needn\u2019t have gone anywhere else for inspiration, its first half \u2013 breezy, unruly, bawdy \u2013 would have been cue enough."

            "Today is national signing day which means the 2019 recruiting cycle is coming to an end. The Notre Dame Fighting Irish ended with a grand total of 23 commitments. Like usual, the Irish went all over the country to get the new players. It was a class thank ranked top 15 in almost all nationally rankings. Now with the class 100% complete, it is time to play the guessing game and project forward the next few years.\nSleeper\nNaNa Osafo-Mensah. Notre Dame is always needing pass rushers it seems like and I do not think NaNa Osafo-Mensah is getting the love he deserves. His dimensions of 6\u20194 and 215 lbs stick out to me. There is room to add strength and to be a problem when rushing the passer.\nBiggest Reach\nI do not have a name for you, but I do have a position. Offensive line. I know it is often about having numbers along the offensive line. Notre Dame is taking four of them in this class. This means one or two are more than likely never going to see the field, hence being a reach.\nImpact Freshman\nI am not including punter Jay Bramblett from the list for this one and going with Jacob Lacey. Notre Dame showed they are willing to rotate in defensive lineman throughout the season. I think Lacey will benefit from being an early enrolle and play impactful snaps as a freshman.\nClass MVP\nKyle Hamilton. I watched this guy\u2019s highlight tape and he looks the part of a dominating safety. I just think he is the most sure thing that Notre Dame just pulled in. The size, speed and football focused attitude are all things pointing towards Kyle Hamilton being a star.\nFuture Captain\nMarist Liufau. The players that Notre Dame signs from Hawaii are always betting than the star ranking given to them. I would expect to Liufau to come to Notre Dame with much to learn and weight to add. I also expect Liufau to be an impactful player on the field during his time in South Bend. I think of Robby Toma and Manti Te\u2019o and see them as leaders. I\u2019m guessing Marist Liufau will bring a great work ethic and outstanding leadership to Notre Dame.\nWell, there are my best guesses for the 2019 class. I think the Notre Dame coaching staff did a solid job. The class lacks the \u201cstar power\u201d at the top but there are a bunch of good football players coming to Notre Dame."

            "Right you shower of bastards, now that Peter Casey is president* things are going to be very different around here. Obviously, we at The Irish Times would like to be among the first to welcome His Dragnificence to the \u00c1ras and to the rest of you, we'd like to say, boy are you going to be sorry. He's going to remember those things you said about him.\nWe were, as you probably guessed, secretly on his side all along. We just feel it\u2019s about time we had a moneyed trigger-happy weirdo as head of State. Hashtag diversity and all that.\nSo, let me remind you of Casey\u2019s plans as laid out in his programme for sort-of-government:\n1) The repatriation of all non-Irish dog breeds \u2013 your Pekinese, your Alsatians, your nefarious Bernese mountain dogs. Ugh. Look at them with their big stupid eyes and fluffy bodies all filled with the mammalian emotion \u201clove\u201d. Slobbery freeloaders coming over here, being all delightful with our presidents and stealing our dog jobs. Who among the Irish people will be unable to relate to my hatred of dogs?\nREAD MORE\n2) Constitution-smonstitution. Reading\u2019s for nerds. All members of the Army are to assemble at His Dragonship\u2019s new gaff post haste. Wear your Army stuff.\n3) \u201cYou can\u2019t do this as president! You can\u2019t do that as president! You can\u2019t carry a sword on a plane! Are you qualified to operate that crane? Blah, blah, blah!\u201d Whisht! I do as I please.\n4) We will find De Valera\u2019s gold! When I first recounted how the ghost of Eoin O\u2019Duffy appeared to me in a dream and told me that De Valera\u2019s treasure was hidden somewhere in the catacombs beneath the \u00c1ras, you laughed at me. Well, who\u2019s laughing now? Certainly not the people who have been conscripted to bulldoze the presidential home (\u201cBut I\u2019m not a builder!\u201d Boo-hoo, whine, whine. Shape up or ship out, losers!).\nAnd even if, as you keep saying, there are no catacombs under the \u00c1ras and ghosts don\u2019t exist and there is no De Valera\u2019s gold, well, what if I told you it was all a kind of metaphor and that the gold was in your heart? Stop laughing. I can do poetry too, you bastards. #wisepoeticpresident.\n5) Have you seen The Running Man with Arnold Schwarzenegger? No matter, you'll catch on soon enough. Yes, those are klaxons you can hear. Say goodbye to your weaker family members and find something pointy. I hate the weak!\n6) A fiver for a picture with the president?! Gosh, that looks like a really good deal. What? You can even pay with credit cards? How convenient! What a convenient presidency!\nTo each of these plans, I say: If anything, he\u2019s not going far enough. Yes, I know it\u2019s surprising to see me, Fintan O\u2019Toole (ignore byline picture), endorsing such positions. But let me be very clear. This is not because I am locked in a dark cabin on the presidential zeppelin, it\u2019s because I now see how wise President Casey is and what clever ideas these are and I am very sorry that we all laughed at him. It has been a good day. Don\u2019t send me to the cornfield.\nAnd\u2026. end scene.\nBack-up editorial\nOkay, that that was all a \"back-up editorial\" I was asked to write yesterday \"just in case\". Pretending to be Fintan O'Toole was just a rhetorical flourish, or what you non-journalistic types call a \"lie\". It's some of my best work, to be honest. It goes on for several pages in this line. I've a great paragraph about Casey curing scrofula with an old potato his grandmother gave him and another about how he won Donegal back from the Brits in a card game at some crossroads (you may think you remember Donegal having always having been part of the Republic, but you are mistaken). We even commissioned an oil painting of Casey on a big white horse in lieu of a photograph (he frets that photography can give you a soul).\nIt was the least we could do. We at George Soros's MSM have been wrong about so much: Trump, Brexit, whether La La Land was any good, the euro, the existence of Slenderman, Tayto chocolate bars, the Progressive Democrats, Taylor Swift \u2013 we were not going to be on the wrong side of history on this one too.\nYes, the incumbent, Michael D Higgins seemed, at the time of writing, to have charmed the nation again with dignity, doggerel and doggies (that's what the D stands for). And yes, his challengers, most notably television businessmen Scrooge McDuck, the Fat Controller from Thomas the Tank Engine and Lex Luthor (I'm sorry, I've already forgotten their real names) seemed destined to return to the business parks of hell to brood and feed and plan their inevitable return in 2025. But, frankly, who knows anything nowadays?*\nApply for on a whim\nAll I know for sure is that the presidency was formerly an important job. Right now, it feels like something you apply for on a whim when your CV is laid out in Comic Sans and covered in jam and you've accidentally printed out one too many. Once you could turn to a talented child with hope in her heart and say: \"One day you might run for president, my kind clever angel.\" Now you'd be more likely to turn towards a slackjawed thug of an infant, one who has no respect for his uncle (you know who you are), to say: \"If you're not careful you might end up running for president, you weird pyromaniacal monster.\"\nI suppose I still believe in democracy. That said, Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael should probably be obliged to put someone forward in future to keep the overconfident business loons at bay. Surely some respectable only marginally-compromised elder statesfolk could have been conjured up from obscurity to give Michael D Higgins some proper competition? It might have helped. Right now the presidency looks like something you run for as a bet. We have seven more years to think about what we've done.\n*This article was written well before there was any inkling of a result. If I am very, very wrong about anything, then good enough for me"

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Senate confirmed 15 more judges late Thursday and left town until after next month\u2019s midterm elections, as Republicans chalked up more wins days after Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court.\nClearing the judicial nominees provided a signature walk-off for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has focused on reshaping the judiciary with more conservative jurists.\nWith the House already gone, the next time Congress conducts business will be after Election Day, Nov. 6. When lawmakers return the following week, the nation will know whether Republicans were able to retain their control of both chambers for next year.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhile many of the judges were approved with bipartisan support, almost half were confirmed on mostly party-line votes. Democratic opponents and their allies swiftly objected to some of the nominees, in large part over views aligned with stricter abortion access.\n\u201cMake no mistake, today was yet another step in the GOP\u2019s takeover of our courts, stacking the deck against women and families at every level,\u201d Ilyse Hogue, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said after the votes. She said the back-to-back votes coming so soon after Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation were especially painful.\nSingled out for opposition were David Porter, who was confirmed as a circuit court judge in Pennsylvania over the objection of that state\u2019s Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, and Mark Norris, confirmed as a district court judge for the Western district of Tennessee.\nRepublicans have seen a bump in polling since Kavanaugh\u2019 confirmation. McConnell has marveled at the way the Supreme Court fight is animating Republican voters \u2014 who, polls showed, had been less enthusiastic before Kavanaugh advanced.\nUnderscoring liberal anger over Trump\u2019s conservative judicial nominees, People for the American Way criticized them as \u201cideological extremists and narrow minded elitists.\u201d\nThe group also chided Democrats for not delaying the votes, saying, \u201cAllowing these confirmations to be rushed through as senators head out of town does a disservice to our democracy and the rule of law.\u201d\nAmong the handful of senators who missed the day\u2019s votes were Democrats Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Bill Nelson of Florida, who face tough re-election races, and Florida Republican Marco Rubio. Florida was battered this week by Hurricane Michael."

        "articles": [
            "It is finally time. Football is back in Steelers Nation and all is well. After a tumultuous wait for our beloved Steelers to be back, they return tonight as they face their in-state rivals. the Philadelphia Eagles. The Steelers are coming off one of the most disappointing losses in recent memory when they lost to Blake Bortles and the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2017 AFC Playoffs.\nNow it is time to see some of the progress and tools which will be at the Steelers\u2019 disposal this season. While only one preseason game, the Steelers will still need to show they have made progress to possibly winning a championship. Given the state of Le\u2019Veon Bell\u2019s contract, this could be possibly be the final year of their championship window, but it seems tonight we will be looking more so into the future, especially with Mason Rudolph expecting to get significant snaps.\nHere are my three things to look for in tonight\u2019s preseason action:\nMason Rudolph\u2019s and Joshua Dobbs \u2019 Progress\nThis is going to be an exciting time for the Steelers as we watch potentially the next franchise Quarterback of the Steelers take the field for the first time.\nBy all accounts. Rudolph has impressed at camp and Kevin Colbert said he was much further along than they actually thought. His progressions and reads have been better by the sound of it and if he shows growth from his college-self this will be a very exciting time to be a Steelers fan.\nJosh Dobbs, on the other hand, has had a pretty rough training camp. He did this last year as well, but showed flashes in the preseason, where he led a few clutch drives, as well as showing his arm off a few times. The Steelers will want to see notable progress from him if he is going to supplant Landry Jones.\nRudolph and Dobbs together are an intriguing duo. Ben Roethlisberger is not playing and we already know what Landry Jones is capable of, but if Dobbs and Rudolph show up, Jones could be out of a job. While I do not consider it likely right now, I do believe there is an outside chance Dobbs and Rudolph do in fact perform well enough Jones is released by the Steelers.\nRudolph and Dobbs both need a lot of work, but with them being young, potential-filled players, you have to find it intriguing. Both had trouble processing the whole field coming out of college, and so against a defense that likes to run exotic looks even in vanilla defense, this is a good test for the young quarterbacks.\nDobbs has to show growth, though. If he does not show any poise in the pocket, ability to improve his ball placement, or show his processing has improved, he may very well prove he was a wasted pick last year by Kevin Colbert.\nThe Safeties\nOther than linebacker, the secondary is a place of intrigue, and yet fear for Steelers fans. Free agent acquisition Morgan Burnett will be looking to impress in a variety of roles as he makes his debut with the Steelers. Rookies Terrell Edmunds and Marcus Allen will also look to have a big impact and prove that they were indeed the correct picks.\nEdmunds, in particular, has to show he has improved on his processing and pursuit angles. By the sounds from camp, both have been true, as he has made a ton of great plays this camp alone, seemingly being the player the Steelers have needed. Allen has to show he can cover at least modestly well. We all know he is a great run defender, but he also has to show he is not a complete liability in coverage\nSean Davis will be playing in his first game as a true Free Safety. He has to show not only is his range a big addition the defense, but he has improved on his tackling. Davis has a knack for getting his nose around the football, he even led the team in tackles last season, but he has to show he can finish the play. Davis led the team in missed tackles last year, and if he can put things together at free safety, the Steelers instantly become a much better defense.\nSleeper Malik Golden will also be looking to impress and perhaps steal a roster spot. He had a great preseason and a good training camp last season until a groin injury ended his hopes of possibly making the roster. He has continued to have a decent camp and can perhaps be a welcome addition to the team as a whole.\nThe Enigma of Jaylen Samuels\nOne of the most versatile, and yet peculiar picks in this draft was Jaylen Samuels. He has so many possible uses in this offense. He can be used as a running back, slot receiver, outside receiver, tight end, H-Back, and fullback.\nThus, it is going to be an interesting story to watch how they use Samuels in today\u2019s game. From the reports out of camp, expect him to be used at running back, slot receiver, and H-back, especially with Vance McDonald being out with a foot injury.\nRandy Fichtner\u2019s scheme calls for exotic plays and versatile players. This is why they drafted Jaylen Samuels. Samuels has a real shot to be a difference maker, and it sounds like he has thus far.\nIt is very likely we will not actually get the full view of just how Samuels will be used, but we will at least get an idea of how he will be used this season. We may see some two running back sets with James Conner very early on in the game. Regardless of how he is used this game, Samuels will be a player to watch, as he very easily can exploit defenses with his versatility."

            "ATLANTA \u2014 A few months ago, nobody knew what to expect from Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.\nMahomes had clear physical talent; that\u2019s why he was a 2017 first-round pick out of Texas Tech. But he started only one game, the season finale, as a rookie. An up-and-down first season starting would have been understandable.\nInstead, Mahomes became the best player in the NFL.\nMahomes won his first MVP and also offensive player of the year as the league handed out its annual awards at the NFL Honors ceremony on Saturday evening.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of credit to the people around me,\u201d Mahomes said backstage after getting the award. \u201cIt truly is an honor.\u201d\n[Watch live: Super Bowl LIII on the Yahoo Sports mobile app, Sunday at 6:30 p.m. ET]\nPatrick Mahomes won his first MVP award after throwing 50 touchdowns this season. (AP)\nHere are the NFL award winners from this season:\nMVP and offensive player of the year: Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes\nMahomes threw for 5,097 yards and 50 touchdowns in his first season as an NFL starter, taking the Chiefs to the No. 1 seed in the AFC. He was dominant from Week 1 on and an easy choice for MVP and offensive player of the year. He\u2019s the first Chief to win the AP\u2019s MVP award. Mahomes is the first Chiefs player to win offensive player of the year since running back Priest Holmes in 2002.\nMahomes beat out Saints quarterback Drew Brees for MVP. Mahomes got 41 first-place votes with Brees getting the other nine, according to David Ely of NFL.com.\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cI got put in a great situation.\n\u201cIt is an honor, it\u2019s a hard award to win. The next award I hope I can get is a Super Bowl.\u201d\nOffensive rookie of the year: Giants RB Saquon Barkley\nBarkley lived up to the hype. He was said to be the best running back prospect in years, and he was great for the Giants. He led the NFL with 2,028 yards from scrimmage, and had 15 total touchdowns.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy to win this award,\u201d Barkley said backstage after getting the award. \u201cDefinitely an honor. A lot of greats before me won this award \u2026 you dream about stuff like this when you\u2019re a little kid.\u201d\nStory continues\nBarkley beat out Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield, who was also fantastic as a rookie. The Browns\u2019 odd decision to not start him in the first three games of the season might have cost him the award.\n\u201cWhat Baker did for Cleveland was unbelievable,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cI wish we could have been co-[winners].\u201d\n[Ditch the pen and paper on football\u2019s biggest day. Go digital with Squares Pick\u2019em!]\nCoach of the year: Bears coach Matt Nagy\nNagy led the Bears to a surprise NFC North championship, and won coach of the year in his first season as a head coach. Last season he was offensive coordinator of the Chiefs with Andy Reid, and the Bears made a great hire. Nagy\u2019s offensive creativity was on display all season, and the Bears defense was dominant on their way to a 12-4 season. The Bears lost in their first playoff game, but it was still a big growth season for the franchise.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t reach the pinnacle, but that\u2019s going to motivate us when we get together this spring and summer,\u201d Nagy said.\nNagy said he cut short a vacation with his wife to St. Lucia to attend the NFL Honors show.\nComeback player of the year: Colts QB Andrew Luck\nLuck missed all last season after shoulder surgery, but returned in a big way. He threw for 4,593 yards and 39 touchdowns, leading the Colts to an AFC wild-card berth. There were plenty of questions about Luck\u2019s ability to come back and play at his previous level during a long rehab after surgery on his labrum, but he immediately re-established himself as one of the top quarterbacks in the NFL.\n\u201cCertainly this was a rewarding and fulfilling season in many ways,\u201d Luck said. \u201cBeing on the field, trying to do your best, it was freeing, liberating.\nDefensive player of the year: Rams DT Aaron Donald\nDonald winning defensive player of the year was one of the easiest picks of the night. Donald set a record for a defensive tackle with 20.5 sacks this season. He has established himself as the best non-quarterback in the NFL and he has won defensive player of the year two seasons in a row.\nDonald wasn\u2019t able to attend NFL Honors because he and the Rams will be playing in Super Bowl LIII on Sunday.\nDefensive rookie of the year: Colts LB Darius Leonard\nLeonard, a second-round pick, led the NFL with 163 tackles and established himself as the star of the Colts defense in his first season. Leonard also had seven sacks and two interceptions, as he instantly became one of the NFL\u2019s best playmakers. Leonard was an All-Pro pick. He beat out Chargers safety Derwin James, who also was a first-team All-Pro as a rookie.\n\u201cI honestly thought I\u2019d have to take a backseat role, take a year or two to get my feet wet,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cI definitely surprised myself.\u201d\nWalter Payton man of the year: Eagles DE Chris Long\nLong was given the NFL\u2019s award for charity work off the field. Long\u2019s foundation helped to provide clean water to impoverished communities in East Africa through an initiative called \u201cWaterboys.\u201d Last year, Long donated all of his game checks for educational programs in his hometown of Charlottesville, Va. and in St. Louis, Boston and Philadelphia, the three cities in which he has spent his NFL career.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous honor,\u201d Long said. \u201cI\u2019m very humbled.\u201d\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\u2022 Watch Super Bowl LIII live stream free with the Yahoo Sports app\n\u2022 LeBron, Durant wear Kaepernick jerseys ahead of Super Bowl LIII\n\u2022 Lakers reportedly underwhelm Pelicans with initial Davis offer\n\u2022 Patriots\u2019 McCourty twins living out their childhood dream\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports.

        "articles": [
            "The fourth and final major of the year commences Thursday when the 2018 PGA Championship begins at Bellerive just outside of St. Louis with a massive 156-man field set to take the course. The field will include 110 of the top 112 golfers in the world and has some truly star-studded feature groups, including Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas going off together over the first two days.\nThat trio has combined to win seven of the last 19 PGA Championships with Thomas as the most recent winner at Quail Hollow in 2017. The No. 2 player in the world is also coming off a WGC-Bridgestone Invitational in which he played in the final pairing with McIlroy and ran away from the field. All three of those golfers are having strong seasons and will be among the most-picked players at Bellerive. However, we all have our own ideas of who's going to take the 100th PGA Championship and how it's all going to unfold, including maybe a few surprises you don't see coming.\nLet's take a look at a few who we think are going to have great (or terrible) weeks. Head over here if you are looking for a full list of odds for the entire 2018 PGA Championship field.\n2018 PGA Championship picks, predictions\nKyle Porter, golf writer\nWinner -- Rory McIlroy (12-1): He's finishing in the top 10 on leaderboards without even really playing terrific golf. Every time I watch him, it feels as if he's trying to bend his body to pull a wedge or long iron back in the direction he wants, and yet, he has six top-eight finishes in his last 12 events worldwide.\nTop 10 lock -- Jason Day (22-1): He's coming off a top 10 at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and has finished in the top 10 at this tournament in four of his last five appearances. The body seems to be intact, and it would be surprising to me if he finished outside the top 10.\nSleeper -- Branden Grace (66-1): Top five in two of the last three PGAs and had some nice finishes at big events earlier this summer. I'm not sure he's long enough to contend here (T79 on the PGA Tour in driving distance), but if he finds fairways, he'll be dangerous.\nTop 5 in order: Rory McIlroy, Jason Day, Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler\nBold prediction: Tiger Woods misses the cut. I don't think this will happen, but it's in play. He might be fading a little bit as the season wears on, and a thick, hot St. Louis atmosphere where the rough is tall and the course long won't exactly fit his wheelhouse.\nLowest round: 63\nWinning score: 266 | Winner's Sunday score: 68\nWho will win the 2018 PGA Championship, and which long shots will stun the golfing world? Visit SportsLine now to find out and see the full PGA Championship projected leaderboard from the model that has nailed four of the last seven majors heading into the weekend and was all over Tiger Woods' surprising run at the The Open Championship.\nChip Patterson, golf writer\nWinner -- Patrick Cantlay (50-1): Like Francesco Molinari and Patrick Reed, I've got Cantlay breaking through with his first major championship win in 2018. It's going to take a much stronger performance on the greens than what he's shown so far this season to win, but Cantlay has been among the best on the PGA Tour off the tee and had his best-ever WGC finish last week at Firestone. Kyle said this week on The First Cut podcast that you could take the leaderboard from the WGC-Bridgestone and make it the likely leaderboard for the PGA Championship, and Cantlay was right there at the top with JT, DJ, Koepka and Rory.\nTop 10 lock -- Dustin Johnson (19/2): It just doesn't seem possible for Johnson to play poorly in a PGA Tour event right now. He might make some mistakes that cost him a shot to win, but DJ's game almost always has him in or near the top 10. In 15 starts this season, Johnson has 10 top 10s with three wins.\nSleeper -- Bryson DeChambeau (80-1): The battle for the final Ryder Cup spots is a top three storyline for me at the PGA Championship, and right now DeChambeau is at No. 9, one spot away from automatically qualifying for the team with only one event (this week at Bellerive) to go until the cut. After winning at the Memorial, DeChambeau pointed to the Ryder Cup as a major goal for 2018, and the only way to guarantee a trip to Paris is a strong showing against his competition for that No. 7 or No. 8 spot.\nTop 5 in order: Patrick Cantlay, Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson, Rory McIlroy, Brooks Koepka\nBold prediction: No one plays well early in the supergroup, which consists of JT, Rory and Tiger Woods. I haven't figured out why (maybe it's too much alpha energy for one space), but I don't think these supergroups have produced much great golf.\nLowest round: 64\nWinning score: 265 | Winner's Sunday score: 67\nAdam Silverstein, golf editor\nWinner -- Justin Thomas (16-1): It's tough to go back-to-back, sure, but Thomas is playing the best golf in the world right now (and has most of the year). I also considered DJ here, but I don't like what I've seen from him recently, whereas Thomas has momentum heading into Bellerive. It also doesn't hurt that this he'll be playing on a second Robert Trent Jones golf course in as many weeks.\nTop 10 lock -- Rory McIlroy (12-1): I could have just as easily picked McIlroy to win the whole thing, and I seriously considered it. Rory is great at PGAs, he's clearly due for a major victory (it has been four years), and the dude is a top 10 machine at majors with 12 in his last 19 such events. Granted, he doesn't have a PGA top 10 since his back-to-back major wins in 2014, but that's another story.\nSleeper -- Tony Finau (50-1): Three straight top 10s in majors this year means he's batting 1.000, and I'm getting him for an absurd value. Granted, he needs to learn how to close and actually win events, but I'll take the hard-hitter on a long course while everyone is salivating over supergroups and Tiger.\nTop 5 in order: Justin Thomas, Bubba Watson, Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson\nBold prediction: Since Kyle and Chip have already taken my \"Tiger misses the cut\" prediction, I'll go in another direction and guess that this year's winner will come from outside the top 10 entering the weekend. In other words, I think Thomas struggles early at Bellerive and sits as many as five shots back entering the weekend before going on an absolute tear Saturday to hop up near the lead. Then there's that Sunday close we all know he's good for delivering.\nLowest round: 64\nWinning score: 268 | Winner's Sunday score: 67"

        "articles": [
            "Spoilers ahead for the penultimate episode of Gotham's fifth and final season on Fox.\nThe fifth and final season of Gotham is very nearly finished, and the penultimate episode was the end of an era that saw Jim Gordon become commissioner, Bruce Wayne head off for the next leg of his Bat-journey, two of his biggest future rogues recommitted to their villainous paths, and more. Even baby Barbara Gordon got to be decked out in her future Batgirl colors. Gotham as we knew it is done, and the series finale next week will be something brand new.\nThe finale flashes forward ten years, which allows Gotham to finally reveal its Batman without putting a teenager in the cape and the cowl. Prepare yourself for some of the last Gotham footage you'll ever get to see and check out the trailer:\nThe Gotham series finale, fittingly called \"The Beginning...\", will apparently see some kind of fancy party or gala, as many of the characters can be spotted in formalwear. The episode picks up ten years after the end of the penultimate episode that saw Bruce depart Gotham, with no sign of when he might want to return. He's finally coming home due to the opening of the new Wayne Tower, which only took a decade to rebuild after he and Selina blew it up to delay Bane.\nSince this is Gotham, there will be some bonkers twists to guarantee that the opening doesn't go off without a hitch. A series of crimes leads Gordon to suspect that his old frenemies Penguin and Riddler are back in the crime game. Bullock will be framed for murder, and the episode description states that \"Gordon begins to piece together an even more sinister plot targeting the city.\" Based on the trailer, I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that Jeremiah has something to do with it!\nFans still have several days to wait before getting to see the series finale; fortunately, the trailer combined with some episode photos have revealed the new looks of a bunch of characters following the flash-forward. Keep scrolling to see what has changed and what hasn't in the ten years between the end of the penultimate episode and the beginning of... well, \"The Beginning...\"\nSome characters -- like Lucius, Lee, and Harvey -- actually basically look the same, but others get a seriously updated appearance. Let's start with the good guys.\nJim Gordon Gets A Mustache\nIn the trailer footage, Jim Gordon looks about the same as he always has. Kudos to him for aging well, but he loses points for not getting a little creative over the past decade. Still, one of the photos released for the finale reveals Jim with a good old-fashioned Commissioner Gordon mustache. He apparently won't have the mustache for all or perhaps even much of the finale, and it looks less creepy than the mustache from Bruce's dream sequence.\nWill the mustache be part of Jim's look at the beginning of the episode, and he shaves it off, thus giving comics fans a nod to the iconic Commissioner Gordon facial hair? My money is definitely on him with the 'stache at the beginning rather than the end. Considering Ben McKenzie's tease of the final scene of Gotham and Gordon's lack of facial hair in what appears to be that scene in the trailer, I'm guessing he doesn't end with it.\nBarbara Went Red\nBarbara Kean has gone through many hairstyles throughout the years. The long blonde hair from her time as Jim's fiancee was chopped short in future seasons. Barbara's hair got crazier and bolder the longer that she spent working with the baddies of Gotham City. She was looking to spend her time on the right side of the law after she discovered she was pregnant in Season 5, so perhaps Sirens has a redhead running the joint without crossing any lines.\nHonestly, for Barbara, I'm guessing that Gotham gave her a redheaded look for the grand finale to explain why her daughter presumably is a redhead. If Babs Gordon takes after the many Babs Gordons who have appeared on the pages of DC Comics and in most adaptations, then she'll have red hair. Could one of Gotham's finale twists be that Barbara has been a natural redhead all along, and only dyeing her hair red? Whatever the reason, Barbara is looking snazzy for the finale.\nAlfred Is Up And At 'Em\nAfter Alfred got his back broken by Bane in a twist on an iconic comics plot, fans had reason to wonder if he was going to be down for the count for the rest of the series. Bane wasn't exactly pulling his punches when he smacked Alfred's spine against a pole, and I can still hear the crunch. Still, Alfred was on his feet, although not looking his best by the end of the penultimate episode.\nThe finale proves that the ten years since his back was broken gave Alfred plenty of time to get back to his dapper old self, although he is still walking with a cane. Still, for a guy who spent a decade recovering from a horrific injury, dealing with the absence of the young man he considers the only son he'll ever have, and rebuilding both a mansion and a skyscraper into his 60s, he looks pretty great. Besides, he can probably do some serious damage with that cane.\nSelina Kyle Gets Catty\nAlthough the trailer for the series finale doesn't give any close looks at Selina's face, it's probably safe to assume that the cat burglar in all black is good old Selina Kyle. There's really no single image from the trailer that does justice to Selina's efforts to rob what appears to be a museum or store with serious security messages, but Selina in motion proves that she's upped her game in the years since Bruce bailed on her.\nHer new look is pretty sleek, and she seems to favor a helmet or a cowl of her own to contain her hair. It looks like she still has the whip, and the clawed gloves are coming in handy in her criminal exploits. Honestly, the young woman deserves some credit for pulling off that backflip in those heels. Would it be too much to ask for a sequence of Batman trying to chase after Catwoman before the final credits roll?\nThe Dark Knight Rises\nYes, the long-awaited debut of the Dark Knight is on the way. Bruce's journey from scared orphan who watched his parents gunned down in an alleyway to young man willing to sacrifice anything if it means saving lives will finally result in him donning the cape and the cowl. Whatever happens during his ten years away from Gotham, he'll be ready to seize his destiny.\nUnfortunately, the ten-year jump that will allow Bruce Wayne to be ready for Batman doesn't also mean actor David Mazouz gets ten years older. Still, Gotham found a way for Mazouz to play Batman despite not being quite big enough just yet to fill the Bat-suit, so the man behind the mask won't be a stranger. Batman's origin story will really, truly, finally produce a Batman! Here's a closer look at the cowl:\nIs it too soon for me to say that I'm excited for this scene? We'll have Batman, a kinda sorta Bat-Signal, and the trio of Jim Gordon, Alfred, and Harvey Bullock looking on. I fully expect it to be one of the most memorable scenes of the series, and possibly give us our closest look at Gotham's Batman. It's too dark to see many Bat details just yet, so we can only hope that it's as great as we've had five seasons to count on.\nBaby Batgirl Is No Longer A Baby\nOnce upon a time, it seemed all but impossible that Jim and his crazy ex Barbara could get together to make the future Batgirl, but Season 5 really found a way to make the wild idea of a baby Barbara Gordon come true. Born in the final episodes before the flash-forward, the closest look at baby Babs so far came from the ceremony where Jim was named commissioner, when she was wearing her little purple and black dress with the yellow bow.\nNot-so-baby Babs in the trailer is still wearing at least one of the signature Batgirl colors, but the footage doesn't show her face or much of her hair to reveal if my redhead theory is correct. All we can really say about 10-year-old Barbara Lee Gordon is that she wears her hair in pigtails, chose a purple sweater that day, and likes to hug her dad. That's enough for now!\nNow, on to the bad guys!\nPenguin Gets An Eye\nPoor Penguin lost an eye in the penultimate episode of the series, after a grenade thrown by Bane shot some shrapnel into his face. The trailer shows that he does get his right eye back -- or at least, a right eye -- somehow, and that's not the only thing he'll add to his face. Penguin is finally getting the monocle that most iconic versions of the character wear at some point or other.\nHis whole look is practically straight from the pages of the comics, aside from the fact that Gotham's Penguin didn't gain a whole lot of weight in the ten-year flash-forward. Robin Lord Taylor didn't have to spend his final episodes as Penguin in a fat suit! He does have the top hat in at least part of the episode, but he loses it at some point. Hat or not hat, he looks like the perfect Penguin.\nRiddler Gets His Question Marks\nEd got a green suit shortly after he made his turn into The Riddler, and he certainly looked spiffy in his green jacket... when he wasn't waking up confused after being used to do dastardly things by the mind control chip in his brain. After his grand speech about no longer being a common criminal in the second-to-last episode of Gotham, Ed has upgraded his villain look. The Riddler has his question marks!\nAnd also a sweet pair of glasses with a green tint that probably isn't too functional but adds a certain flair. His glasses are green, his shoes are shiny silver, his tie has question marks, and the result is that we have a classic Riddler look who strikes quite a villainous figure. Honestly, seeing the new looks for Riddler and Penguin just makes me want a spinoff all about their exploits together all the more.\nJeremiah's New Look Is Super Creepy\nWell, Gotham made us wait all the way until the series finale to see Cameron Monaghan's final new look as Jeremiah Valeska, but it looks like the wait will be worth it. Although this trailer doesn't actually show much of him, another preview showed him in all his creepy, Joker-esque glory. His delightfully unnerving cackle is heard, however, and the footage is enough to reveal that he breaks out of Arkham, presumably with the help of none other than Ecco.\nHonestly, Jeremiah doesn't look that bad considering he was dumped in mysterious acid, and it didn't look like anybody was exactly rushing to fish him out. All signs pointed toward him never recovering. Good for him, I guess? As for Ecco, she's looking much spiffier than Jeremiah, although no less bonkers.\nEcco Still Looks Like Harley Quinn\nGotham may never have delivered Harley Quinn herself, but Ecco definitely fit the bill just as much as Jeremiah fit the bill for the Joker, and she'll get one more episode to show off why she's such a dangerous ally for the madman.\nThe trailer shows her having infiltrated Arkham, presumably to spring Jeremiah from the clink and unleash him on the city again. Ecco will apparently pay a visit to Sirens on top of Arkham, and it should be fun to see what she gets up to before the final credits roll.\nTune in to Fox on Thursday, April 25 at 8 p.m. ET to catch the series finale of Gotham."

            "Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen will miss roughly the next month as he receives treatment for an irregular heartbeat, sources tell ESPN's Buster Olney. Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic adds that Jansen's condition is considered to be \"very manageable.\"\nJansen was hospitalized prior to the Dodgers' win over the Rockies in Denver on Thursday night and then returned to Los Angeles for additional testing. Jansen dealt with irregular heartbeats earlier in his career, but as MLB.com's Anne Rogers points out prior to Thursday he had not suffered a recurrence since undergoing surgery in October of 2012.\nThis season Jansen in his age-30 season has pitched to a 2.15 ERA/185 ERA+ and a 4.36 K/BB ratio in 54 1/3 innings. He's also racked up an NL-leading 32 saves in 35 opportunities. Jansen, a three-time All-Star, is in the second year of a five-year, $80 million contract with Los Angeles.\nThe Dodgers are of course locked in a tight battle for the NL West title, and losing Jansen for a month or so is a significant blow. While Jansen is out, manager Dave Roberts figures to play matchups in order to protect late-inning leads."

(Chris Tomasson on Twitter)\nFantasy Impact:\nCook missed the Week 3 game against the Bills with a hamstring injury. Some felt it was a move to have him ready for Thursday night's big matchup with the Rams,. however, \"possibility\" is not a ringing endorsement from the coach. If Cook sits it will be Latavius Murray getting the start with Mike Boone backing him up. If Cook plays he would be a risky fantasy option as he might not get a full workload or he could get replaced if the Vikings fall behind."

            "The North Carolina Zoo has huge baby news to report this week.\nOn Monday, a female southern white rhino calf was born to mom Linda and dad Stormy. The calf, the first born at the zoo in 41 years, weighed in at about 80 to 90 pounds.\nThere's no name yet for this little (big) one. A zoo press release says that will come later. She will soon join the herd on the habitat and will be on view to the public \"as soon as possible,\" the release says.\n\"Every birth at the North Carolina Zoo is special and this one particularly so,\u201d said Pat Simmons, executive director of the zoo, in a press release. \u201cWith each new rhino born, it is a success story for this species as a whole. The zoo is committed to being part of conservation initiatives both within the zoo community and internationally in order to ensure the survival of this species.\"\nWhite rhinos 'near threatened'\nSouthern white rhinos were hunted to near extinction by the beginning of the 20th century for their horns, which some erroneously believe provide medicinal benefits, according to the zoo. White rhinos still face major threats from poaching and habitat loss.\nAccording to the International Rhino Foundation , about 20,000 live in the wild and the species is considered \"near threatened.\" The closely-related northern white rhino was declared effectively extinct this spring when the last male died, leaving only two females. The 45-year-old rhino named Sudan had been in poor health and was being treated for age-related issues and multiple infections when he died in March.\nThe zoo\u2019s herd of southern white rhinos includes Stormy and females Linda, Kit, Natalie and Abby, who zoo visitors can see. Two older rhinos, Stan and Olivia live in an off-viewing retirement habitat. N.C. zoo staff also work on projects in several countries in southern Africa to save the species from extinction, according to the press release.\n\u201cWhen people visit our rhino family they get the chance to see truly unique animals in one of the largest, most natural habitats for this species in the world,\u201d said Simmons in the press release. \u201cBut the rhinos here at the North Carolina Zoo are also ambassadors for their wild cousins. Visiting the zoo supports our efforts to help save this species in the wild.\u201d\nBaby rhino doing well\nThe zoo reports that the baby rhino is \"healthy, nursing and developing normally.\" She is expected to gain 100 pounds a month in the first year and could weigh anywhere from 3,500 to 5,500 pounds when fully grown, according to the zoo.\nThe Zoo\u2019s 40-acre Watani Grasslands expansion \u2013 completed in 2008 \u2013 was created specifically for a breeding rhino herd, the press release says. The Zoo has had rhinos since 1976 and is part of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) Species Survival Plan (SSP) to keep a sustainable population of southern white rhinos under human care.\nFun facts about rhinos\nAccording to the N.C. Zoo, these amazing animals:\nAre the second-largest land mammal after elephants.\nCan be pregnant anywhere from 16 to 18 months.\nWill only give birth every two to five years.\nWill, at full maturity, have two horns, grow to 12-13 feet long and up to 6 feet from hoof to shoulder, and weigh 4,000 to 5,000 pounds.\nCan live 40-50 years and run at impressive speeds of up to 30 miles per hour.\nAre herbivores and graze on grass, which helps maintain the diverse African grasslands, increase plant diversity and provide grazing areas for other animals that share their natural habitat: the savannahs of Africa. They have a similar diet at the zoo, getting most of their food while grazing the 40 acres of the Watani Grasslands Reserve."

A second-place finisher at the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association state meet in 2017, he \"was shot to death on the 1800 Block of East Pastorious Street ... at 9:37 Monday night,\" as told by the Philadelphia Police Department.\nMarche's death remains \"under investigation\" by police, according to Linder.\nImhotep, Penn State and countless friends and family are mourning the loss of not only \"a great young man,\" as high school assistant Cyril Woodland told Linder, but a promising track and field prospect.\n\"I feel like he was the fastest kid in the state,\" Imhotep head football coach Nick Lincoln told Linder, who noted that Marche was regularly headlining track meets when he wasn't on the football field:\nHis second-place finish in the 100 two years ago wasn't the only strong showing for the speedster. He was third in the state in the 100 in 2016, and finished fourth at the state meet earlier this year. He finished fourth in the 60 at the 2017 indoor state championships and was fifth in 2016.\nMarche passed away at Albert Einsten Medical Center on Tuesday night, according to the Philadelphia Daily News."

            "UPDATE 4/4/19 8:50 PM\nThe jury returned verdicts in the Hart case on Thursday, ruling that the mothers died by suicide and all six children died by homicide. Each decision was unanimous and the deliberations took just one hour. The manner of death will now be entered by the county onto each one of their official death certificates.\nThe four options presented to the jury were: natural, suicide, accident, and \"at the hands of another, other than by accident,\" which the sheriff clarified is homicide.\nIn some of the final testimony of the day, California Highway Patrol Officer Jake Slates said, \"Ultimately, I feel that based on Sarah and Jen's history, the pattern of alleged abuse, that this was just another case where they ran.\"\nSlates believes the women had not yet totally decided on the suicide plan while Googling about methods on Saturday or while they were buying groceries at Safeway or toiletries at Dollar Tree on Sunday morning. At some point, Slates says, while driving along the coast in their final day, they decided to commit to the plan. That \"if they couldn't have those kids, then nobody was going to have those kids.\"\nMendocino County Sheriff Lt. Shannon Barney echoed Slates' conclusion on the stand: \"It is my belief that both Jennifer and Sarah succumbed to a lot of pressure ... to the point they made a conscious decision to end their lives and to take the children with them.\"\nORIGINAL STORY:\nLast September Glamour reported on the tragic story of the Harts\u2014mothers Jennifer and Sarah Hart and their six adopted children. On social media Jen Hart portrayed the image of a happy, postracial American family, but what was going on inside their Woodland, Washington, home turned out to be something very different.\nJen, Sarah, and their children Markis, 19, Hannah, 16, Devonte, 15, Abigail, 14, Jeremiah, 14, and Sierra, 12 (two sets of black biological siblings) were often referred to as the Hart Tribe. But on March 26, 2018, their car was found at the bottom of a cliff off California's Highway 1.\nIn the coroner\u2019s inquest today at the Willitts Justice Center in Willitts, California, investigators have revealed the timeline of what happened in the family\u2019s final hours. Among the new details revealed in testimony today was exactly what was in the system of each family member when the Yukon plummeted off the cliff. Evidence presented showed that many members of the family were most likely heavily sedated, with Sarah, who investigators say was in the passenger seat, having the equivalent of 42 single doses of diphenhydramine, a Benadryl-like drug, in her system.\nJennifer was driving\u2014and was legally drunk\u2014but didn\u2019t show signs of having taken diphenhydramine. Investigators revealed that the family had purchased an Equate-branded version at a Walmart in Washington State shortly after leaving their house on March 23, 2018, before continuing down the Pacific coast. Both liquid and pill versions of the drug were found in the family\u2019s car."

            "As one journey ends, another begins in the season two finale of Iron Fist.\n\u201cA Duel of Iron\u201d literally deals with the dueling natures of the characters throughout this season of Iron Fist. Danny and Davos, Joy and Ward, Mary and herself, Colleen and her past, all of these things have been a culmination of the past two seasons. In a way, this finale feels like an ending to the chapter which begun in season one. The flash forward teases a new story to come, and the possibilities are endless.\nThe actual fight with Davos doesn\u2019t last very long, and that\u2019s a good thing. All of the highlights from this season have involved the character-driven moments. It\u2019s nice to see how everyone deals with the consequences of their decisions from the past ten episodes rather than draw out the transference ceremony.\nNaturally, Davos doesn\u2019t take too kindly to Colleen having part of his power. The two are immense pain, with the serpent desperate to be whole. Davos levels the dojo before taking off to regroup back at the warehouse. Unfortunately for him, Walker has set up in the highest corner of the warehouse waiting for his return. \u201cA Duel of Iron\u201d has her happily singing a tune as she disposes of Chen\u2019s body and gets ready. It\u2019s the only time we\u2019ve seen her enjoy violence this season, and it\u2019s interesting seeing the different personality quirks for each alter.\nDavos doesn\u2019t find it quite as interesting as he tries to avoid each of her shots. Eventually, he uses the fist to knock her out of her vantage point to force a ground pursuit. Before she can strike, Danny and Colleen come running into the warehouse to interrupt this plan. Once again, Danny asks Walker to not kill Davos since they need him. Before he can explain much more Davos comes flying from behind to take down Colleen forcing Danny to take on Walker.\nJust as Walker is about to take him down, Misty comes blasting out of the locked room where Walker had placed her. While she loses her \u201cMaserati\u201d arm during the fight, the two do subdue Walker by triggering the sprinkler system and using a phone as a strobe light. This brings out the Mary personality, who gently ends the fighting before introducing herself to Misty.\nDanny goes to Colleen\u2019s side where the two go up against Davos. The fight ends relatively quickly not that Danny is there to tip the odds in their favor. Colleen completes the power transference and Davos begs her to end him. She informs him that would make her no better than him before walking away. The greatest punishment he can suffer is knowing he not only lost the power of the fist but to the woman he continually called a \u201cwhore\u201d throughout Iron Fist.\nNow that this war is over, where does that leave everyone? Davos is headed to prison, with Danny still offering him compassion and hope for a better path. Misty is unsure about taking the Captain\u2019s job still, but she does mention \u201cKnight and Wing\u201d has a nice sound to it. Could a private investigation business be in the near future? Could Daughters of the Dragon actually get a series? It definitely seems like Netflix is considering the possibility even if nothing is official.\nWalker isn\u2019t in jail, but she\u2019s definitely not heading into hiding like her previous plan. She confidently strolls into Joy\u2019s place but is surprised by a hobbled Joy holding a gun. Joy tosses the bag of money to her and begs her to leave. Unfortunately, an escape isn\u2019t what Walker is looking for anymore. She wants answers, which means she\u2019ll need the Rand connections, influence, and money to get them. Looks like Joy will be paying for her mistakes next season as well.\nWard ends this season of Iron Fist on a path towards something positive. He finally is able to open up at NA where he reveals just how lonely he feels. It\u2019s the most emotionally raw we\u2019ve seen him in a long time and Tom Pelphrey is absolutely captivating. While this is a step in the right direction, it isn\u2019t quite large enough for Bethany to forgive him yet. She wants to deal with pregnancy on her own for now because she\u2019s not sure whether he\u2019ll backslide again. It\u2019s easy to see her as being a little too hard on him, but it\u2019s actually a pretty justified fear to have with an addict.\nWhat kind of person will Danny be without the Iron Fist? Everything in his life is unclear now that the battle has been won. Especially with Colleen, with their relationship being unclear. He had her cross some personal lines this season, some she said would be hard to come back from. While they both still care about one another, their relationship is definitely no longer in the honeymoon stage. She heads to Bayard to let Mrs. Yang know that there\u2019s a new hero in town who will be watching her illegal activity.\nWhen she returns home, Danny has left. He discovered on the back of her family seal the mark of the Iron Fist. He leaves a letter where he explains the reason for him taking off. Turns out the Pirate Queen from her mother\u2019s story is actually the first woman to wield the Iron Fist. He believes it wasn\u2019t chance that led them to meet in the park, but it was his destiny to bring the fist to her so she could take up the mantle.\nIn the flash forward, she does just that. Colleen uses her fist to stop crime, and it lights up her ancient katana. Danny and Ward, who embarked on a soul-searching mission to Asia, have also become a well-oiled machine. Their friendship has been one of the best parts of this season of Iron Fist, and it\u2019s fun to see the two going on missions together. They\u2019re looking for whoever supplied Davos with the corpse of a former Iron Fist, a man apparently named Orson Randall. Danny also stole some guns which apparently have some sort of power from the dragon.\nHow will this effect a potential season 3 of Iron Fist? That\u2019s yet to be seen but this certainly feels like the beginning to a whole new chapter for all of the heroes.\nDid you like this season? Tell us in the comments below!"

I was focused from the beginning and I finished it that way.\"\nKasatkina, 21, managed just three winners in the match.\nSharapova next faces French sixth seed Caroline Garcia for a place in the quarter-finals.\nFive-time major winner Sharapova leads the head-to-head against Garcia 4-1 but the French player won their only meeting in the last three years on clay in Stuttgart in April.\nWorld number four Kerber, playing for the first time since defeating Serena Williams in last month's Wimbledon final, slumped to a 6-4, 6-1 loss to Alize Cornet of France.\nGerman left-hander Kerber committed 32 unforced errors against the 34th-ranked Cornet in her 85-minute second round exit.\nCornet, 28, goes on to face Ashleigh Barty of Australia in the third round.\nIt was her second successive victory against Kerber having also triumphed on hard court in Beijing last year.\nBarty, the Australian 15th seed, defeated Belgium's Alison Van Uytvanck 7-6 (9/7), 6-2 while recently-married Czech ninth seed Karolina Pliskova suffered a 6-2, 6-2 defeat at the hands of Kiki Bertens of the Netherlands.\nFifth seed and defending champion Elina Svitolina went through to the third round after in-form Romanian opponent Mihaela Buzarnescu was forced to retire with an ankle injury.\nSvitolina was leading 6-3, 6-7 (5/7), 4-3 when the weekend San Jose champion turned her ankle and was forced to leave the court in a wheelchair and in floods of tears.\nUS Open champion and third seed Sloane Stephens also made the third round by seeing off home hope Francoise Abanda 6-0, 6-2."

            "Yet another new Fortnite skin depicting a Season 4 supervillain was leaked, and it looks even scarier than \u201cVisitor.\u201d \u201cOmen\u201d is some kind of darkly-clad supervillain whose face is obscured, and he wears a long cape and leather armor like many of the other characters.\nMonday\u2019s version 4.4 update to Fortnite brought several changes, including a new soccer stadium to the map, but hidden in the game\u2019s code are several new skins tied to an ongoing Blockbuster Challenge.\nPlayers have to complete all of the Weekly Challenges for every week, which unlocks the new loading screen. That screen always holds some kind of clue, be it map coordinates or a specific landmark. Once a player discovers a certain location, they can find a Battle Star in a fashion similar to the \u201csearch between a\u201d Weekly Challenge format.\nHere\u2019s Omen, a Legendary skin that might be available later this week when Week 7 starts, which means you\u2019ll have to complete all of the Week 7 Challenges if you want any chance at getting this skin:\nOmen looks similar to Raven but if he were a crisply-costumed supervillain instead. Epic Games\nSo what does it all mean?\nSeason 4 brought with it a series of meteors and a superhero theme to Fortnite, but what\u2019s \u201creal\u201d and what\u2019s \u201cfake\u201d?\nBased on all of the cameras and film sets, it seems like some production company was filming a movie when real meteors crashed into the map. Consider this loading screen, which depicts an active production as a meteor strikes:\nThis 'Fortnite' loading screen helps fill in some backstory. Epic Games\nBecause Hop Rocks exist and cause gravity distortions, it seems perfectly plausible that the many superheroes and supervillains that also pop up in various loading screens are totally real. Keep in mind that there\u2019s also the superhero mansion and supervillain lair in the map now as well. And yet, there are also loading screens depicting superheroes and villains hanging out on a film set, so who knows?\nIt\u2019s impossible to know for sure, but it seems likely that the Visitor and Omen skins might be available as part of the Blockbuster Challenge when Week 7 starts on Thursday at 4 a.m. Eastern."

            "The music has been switched off at the Red Light pub in the heart of the picturesque old town of Gda\u0144sk. A single candle adorned with a black ribbon rests on the bar. The city is in mourning.\nThe people of Gda\u0144sk are coming to terms with the death of their mayor, Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz, who was stabbed on stage at a charity concert in front of thousands of people on Sunday. A public appeal led to crowds of people queueing for hours to donate blood to save their mayor, but he was pronounced dead on Monday afternoon.\nAt the Red Light, people console each other between shots dedicated to Adamowicz. Adela Szczepa\u0144ska-Ko\u015bcielnik was at the concert when the attack happened. It was the local finale of a nationwide charity drive, the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity, which raises funds to buy equipment for children\u2019s units in state-run hospitals. The concerts end with a countdown towards the moment when fundraising stops and people raise lights in the air in celebration. Adamowicz was leading the countdown; the attack was timed to coincide with the moment it reached zero.\n\u201cAt the end of the countdown we didn\u2019t understand what happened. There was no light, no music. A girl started screaming: \u2018They killed him! They killed him!\u2019 We were confused, some people thought it was a joke. The city has never been so sad, it is as if someone cut the electricity.\u201d\n01:02 Thousands across Poland pay tribute to stabbed Gda\u0144sk mayor - video\nAfter the announcement of the mayor\u2019s death on Monday, thousands of people gathered at the statue of Neptune in the city\u2019s Long Market, also home to city hall, where Adamowicz served for more than 20 years. With tears running down people\u2019s faces, the crowd stood motionless as they listened to an a capella version of Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s Sound of Silence.\nThis was silence with a purpose \u2013 not only to mourn, but to protest against an increasing prevalence of hate speech in Polish public discourse that Adamowicz had attempted to confront. A staunch defender of migrants and refugees and of LGBT rights, he had marketed Gda\u0144sk as a liberal enclave, a city in open defiance of the xenophobic nationalism promoted by Poland\u2019s rightwing Law and Justice party (PiS), which has governed since 2015.\n\u201cI am a European so my nature is to be open,\u201d Adamowicz told the Guardian in 2016. \u201cGda\u0144sk is a port and must always be a refuge from the sea.\u201d\nHis liberal stance cast him as a hate figure for government supporters and the far right. In a 2017 publicity stunt, the All-Polish Youth movement published a series of \u201cpolitical death certificates\u201d of pro-European politicians; on Adamowicz\u2019s certificate, they put his \u201ccause of death\u201d as \u201cliberalism, multiculturalism, stupidity\u201d. Observers say he was regularly subjected to personal attacks and abuse on social media and from rightwing media outlets.\nDemonstrators holding a \u2018stop the hate\u2019 banner during a march in memory of Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz on Monday. Photograph: Attila Husejnow/Sopa Images/Rex/Shutterstock\nSome of the attacks continued even after he died. In an interview with a rightwing media outlet broadcast on the day Adamowicz\u2019s death was announced, the far-right politician Grzegorz Braun described him as a \u201ctraitor to the nation\u201d for his political views.\n\u201cSadly, hatred is becoming more and more visible and more widely accepted in Polish political and social life,\u201d read a joint declaration of Jewish organisations in Poland, published on Tuesday. \u201cThe death of Mayor Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz is yet another tragic warning signal that in our society, ideological differences, and differences of worldview, can lead \u2013 in extreme cases \u2013 to acts of physical violence.\u201d\nAdamowicz told the Italian newspaper la Repubblica in 2017: \u201cPhysical abuse is normally preceded by verbal violence. When the language of the elites violates the limits imposed by decency, it causes more and more physical violence. Unfortunately this is not a theory but the reality, as the growing cases of racially and religiously based violence demonstrate.\u201d\nSome people have drawn parallels between Adamowicz\u2019s murder and the assassination of Gabriel Narutowicz, the leftwing president of interwar Poland who was shot by a rightwing activist in the 1920s. Making this connection explicit, a silent \u201cmarch against hatred\u201d held in Warsaw on Monday evening made its way through the streets of the capital to the Zach\u0119ta art gallery, where Narutowicz was killed in 1922.\nA woman signs a book of condolence for Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz in Warsaw on Tuesday. Photograph: Tomasz Gzell/EPA\nMany on the Polish right have accused their liberal opponents of politicising the murder by attributing political motives to the killing. The alleged murderer, a 27-year-old resident of Gda\u0144sk named in press reports as \u201cStefan W\u201d, said he had been released from prison only last month after serving a jail sentence for a series of violent bank robberies. According to Polish media reports, he was diagnosed with and treated for paranoid schizophrenia while in prison, but stopped taking his medication before his release. He pleaded not guilty to murder on Monday.\nMany of Adamowicz\u2019s supporters, noting he has long been a target of aggressive government propaganda, are incensed at what they regard as attempts by those they hold largely responsible for Poland\u2019s toxic political climate to wash their hands of any responsibility.\n\u201cIf you watched our main government TV, you would see that for months there were programmes about how bad he is, how he lies, how he steals,\u201d said Witek Nabo\u017cny, a resident of Gda\u0144sk who had come to the statue of Neptune to pay his respects. \u201cThey created a mood in which weak people, sick people, respond to this kind of atmosphere.\u201d\n\u201cAdamowicz has become a symbol of something bigger than the attack itself. He died during a charity event that tries to bring Poles together. As a result, he became a symbol of the death of unity in this society,\u201d said Rafa\u0142 Pankowski, the director of the Never Again association, an anti-racism campaign group. Adamowicz had begun his career as a much more conservative politician, he said.\n\u201cHe started to become more and more outspoken on issues of diversity and minority rights and tolerance just as society was moving in the opposite direction. It was very impressive. He was a very brave man \u2013 and he paid for it.\u201d"

            "HALIFAX -- Tropical storm Chris is expected to swing south of Nova Scotia at hurricane strength later this week before making landfall in Newfoundland as a \"very strong\" post-tropical storm, a meteorologist warned Tuesday.\nEnvironment Canada meteorologist Ian Hubbard said the storm was off the coast of Carolina on Tuesday and was expected to intensify as it started moving northeast later in the day.\nThe storm was expected to track south of Nova Scotia at hurricane strength on Thursday, but Hubbard said it was too early to determine if wind or rainfall warnings would be required for Nova Scotia or southeastern Newfoundland, where a Friday arrival is in the forecast.\n\"As it tracks towards Newfoundland, it will diminish from a hurricane to a post-tropical storm, but it will still be very strong, and it will still be a significant storm at that point,\" Hubbard said in an interview from Halifax.\nGiven the storm's predicted track, the strongest winds were expected to be over Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula. Southern coastlines of that region could also expect storm surges.\n\"Eastern Newfoundland, specifically the Avalon Peninsula, seems to be the area we're going to pay a lot of attention to over the next couple of days with the forecast,\" said Hubbard.\nHubbard said the storm's track amounted to good news for people in Nova Scotia, but some eastern areas of the province could still expect some rain.\n\"There could also be some decent waves along the Atlantic coast, with wave heights as high as four metres for Cape Breton,\" Hubbard said.\nMeanwhile, Environment Canada issued an air quality advisory Tuesday for the Fredericton area due to smoke from forest fires in New Brunswick. High levels of air pollution were expected to develop in the provincial capital and Southern York County.\nA heat advisory also remained in effect for much of New Brunswick and northern Nova Scotia, where temperatures were expected to reach as high as 33 C in some areas."

            "Officiating controversy has been a significant theme this NFL season and has continued into the playoffs with borderline calls impacting would-be scoring plays.\nBut the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 wild-card win over the Chicago Bears Sunday provided a call that required a deep dig into the NFL rule book.\nWith time running out in the first half of a 3-3 game, the Bears were driving into Eagles territory. Quarterback Mitchell Trubisky looked deep to Anthony Miller on second-and-three from the 35-yard line.\nAnthony Miller fumble ruled incomplete pass\nMiller appeared to catch the pass before being stripped by Eagles cornerback Cre\u2019Von LeBlanc on the way to the ground around the 5-yard line. It was a bang-bang play that was ruled an incomplete pass on the field and resulted in the ball rolling on the ground unrecovered before an official picked it up.\nAnthony Miller caught and fumbled a pass, but when nobody recovered it, confusion ruled on replay. (Getty)\nOfficials reviewed the play, which showed that Miller did appear to make the catch before fumbling the ball. NBC rules analyst and former NFL official Terry McAulay believed that it was a catch and fumble. But with nobody recovering the ball and the initial call being an incomplete pass, how would things be sorted out?\nComplete pass ruled incomplete due to quirky rule\nAfter reviewing the play, referee Tony Corrente appeared to confirm McAuley\u2019s analysis that it was a complete pass.\n\u201cAfter review, the ruling on the field will stand,\u201d Corrente said. \u201cThere was no clear recovery of the football. Therefore, the ball will go back. It will be third down.\u201d\nThe call confused McAuley.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a runner at this point,\u201d McAuley said of Miller. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t give him the catch. If they\u2019re going by that you have to finish it with a recovery, and you can\u2019t change it, then I guess that\u2019s the rule. Somebody could have recovered it. You\u2019ve taken away a catch from Chicago.\u201d\nOfficials got replay call correct\nBut a dive into the rulebook shows that though officials got the call wrong on the field, they made the proper replay conclusion.\nStory continues\nCorrente acknowledged that there was a catch and a fumble by noting that \u201cthere was no clear recovery.\u201d\nBut when this situation happens, and there\u2019s no recovery, the rulebook dictates that the ruling of incomplete must stand, even with the acknowledgment that there was a valid catch.\nFrom the casebook regarding incomplete passes reversed to catch/fumble, the third paragraph has the relevant information: pic.twitter.com/TQizOr7ZFP \u2014 F\u1d0f\u1d0f\u1d1b\u0299\u1d00\u029f\u029f Z\u1d07\u0299\u0280\u1d00s (@footballzebras) January 6, 2019\n\u201cIf there is no video evidence of a clear recovery or the ball going out of bounds, the ruling of incomplete stands.\u201d\nThe NFL Officiating Twitter account confirmed that was indeed the call that was made.\n\u201cIn #PHIvsCHI, the receiver controlled the ball with two feet down & took an additional step, so it was a catch. However, because he was not down by contact & there was \u2018no video evidence of a clear recovery or the ball going out of bounds\u2019, the ruling of incomplete stands.\u201d \u2013 AL pic.twitter.com/c0E00tOZwT \u2014 NFL Officiating (@NFLOfficiating) January 6, 2019\nSo, in short. The officials got the call wrong on the field. But no Eagles or Bears player jumped on the loose ball, forcing officials to rule the catch an incomplete pass.\nThe Bears would go on to kick a field goal and take a 6-3 lead before the end of the half. Had an Eagles player jumped on the loose ball, that score would have never happened. Philadelphia ended up eking out a 16-15 win when Cody Parkey\u2019s 43-yard field goal attempt bounced off the left upright and the crossbar in the game\u2019s final seconds.\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\u2022 Robinson: Keeping Jason Garrett paid off for Jerry Jones\n\u2022 Warriors-Kings combine to set history for most 3-pointers in NBA game\n\u2022 19-year-old Cal DB dies after collapsing during workout\n\u2022 Deshaun Watson\u2019s streak ends in loss to Colts"

            "SPOILER ALERT: Do not read ahead if you have not watched the season finale of Becca Kufrin\u2019s season of \u201cThe Bachelorette,\u201d which aired Aug. 6 on ABC.\n\u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d Becca Kufrin walked away from the finale with a fianc\u00e9 in Garrett, which means one thing \u2014 Blake is going to be \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d\nNot so fast.\nABC confirms to Variety that the next \u201cBachelor\u201d has not been cast yet, and while there are frontrunners, no decisions have been made when it comes to the next leading man.\nThe network isn\u2019t tasked to make any casting decisions until the end of summer because \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d does not head into production until this September, ahead of its early 2019 premiere. So the casting team will wait to see the audience\u2019s reception to last night\u2019s gut-wrenching finale, which saw Blake get his heart broken, plus the new season of \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d to see which reality stars may become fan-favorites, just like Nick Viall did a few summers back, which ultimately landed him the top spot as \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d\n\u201cThe audience is the silent producer of this show. We want to see who people want to see as \u2018The Bachelor,\u2019\u201d Rob Mills, ABC\u2019s SVP of alternative series, specials & late-night programming, tells Variety. \u201cThere are several candidates, and there\u2019s no consensus from the audience. People have pros and cons on several people. We also want to see when we start talking to girls who will be in the potential cast, who they like.\u201d\nMills suggests that the frontrunners include runner-up Blake and second runner-up Jason, plus Colton, Wills, and even Grocery Store Joe. The executive also says it\u2019s possible ABC could look outside the pool of current contestants.\nWhen asked if the network would ever cast a complete stranger \u2014 someone who has never appeared on any part of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d franchise \u2014 Mills says, \u201c100%. Absolutely.\u201d\n\u201cI think there are some things that are super exciting about that,\u201d Mills continues. \u201cIt would be exciting getting to know someone that we don\u2019t know. But there are also some cons there because I think we are able to service the lead better when we know them really well and know who might be the best partner now. But absolutely \u2014 we\u2019re only hurting ourselves if we don\u2019t look at every option.\u201d\nHere, ABC executive Rob Mills weighs in on the potential frontrunners who could become \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d for Season 13\u2026\nBLAKE:\nThe verdict: Blake is certainly a possibility, but he might be too heartbroken to find love right now\u2026\n\u201cI think Blake will certainly get some traction. I\u2019m going to be fascinated to see what people think or how Blake even feels about it \u2014 is Blake too heartbroken to be \u2018The Bachelor?\u2019 He was torn down to the core. He is so beyond heartbroken. I think he needs to ask himself that and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d\nJASON:\nThe verdict: Jason is definitely in the running\u2026\n\u201cJason, he sort of admitted, he and Becca had insanely strong chemistry and strong feelings, he was a little bit more of a slow burn, so I think he\u2019s ready to jump back in.\u201d\nCOLTON:\nThe verdict: If his storyline pops on \u201cBachelor in Paradise,\u201d there\u2019s a chance\u2026\n\u201cI think we have to watch Colton\u2019s arc on \u2018Bachelor in Paradise.\u2019 You want to look at everything. When we\u2019ve really been rewarded is when we look at as wide of a net as possible, and look at pros and cons.\u201d\nWILLS\nThe verdict: Wills is absolutely in the running. If anything, for his fashion sensibility\u2026\n\u201cWills had a massive following and had a very different approach. His reactions sometimes to some of the guys was priceless. He really called it like it was, and that could be very interesting to see, in terms of dating 25 women. He is also probably the most stylist person we\u2019ve ever had on the history of the show.\u201d\nGROCERY STORE JOE:\nThe verdict: Actually, there is a chance\u2026\n\u201cI mean, do we take a huge left turn? I think everything is a possibility. He\u2019s on \u2018Bachelor In Paradise,\u2019 so we\u2019ve got to watch what the reaction is. There was such a huge following for Grocery Store Joe \u2014 someone that we really know nothing about, but we will know more after \u2018Bachelor In Paradise.\u2019\u201d"

Once Cordelia sees what could happen, she and the rest of the Coven witches will have to fix things in the present so the doomsday from episode one never occurs.\nOur other guess is that the witches, who can time travel, go back in time to stop the doomsday from occurring, basically rewriting history.

            "Hundreds of people in a caravan of migrants travelling across Central America attempted to breach the Mexican border on Friday, as local governments began preparing to disperse the convoy under pressure from Washington.\nMigrants poured through Guatemalan border posts in the town of Tecun Uman and onto a bridge leading to Mexico, only to be halted by dozens of Mexican police in riot gear.\nMexico's president sharply rebuked the migrants for the border surge.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has warned the Central American caravan\u2014which includes women, children and elederly people\u2014must be stopped before it reaches the United States, and Honduras and Guatemala said late on Friday they were mobilizing to assist the return of Honduran migrants to their homeland.\nPresident Trump threatened Friday to close the U.S. border to halt the carvan, and said he would call on the military to assist if necessary.\nSome migrants violently shook fences at the border and police said a few officers were injured in clashes. A handful of migrants jumped into the Suchiate River below to swim for rafts. Others turned back toward Guatemala.\nCarrying backpacks and small children, many migrants simply sat down on the bridge. Some said that they had been tear gassed. As the afternoon drew on, a tropical storm, Vicente, formed nearby off the Pacific coast.\nJose Brian Guerrero, a 24-year-old Honduran traveling with neighbors and his extended family, told Reuters he had joined the caravan to escape violent street gangs, and to find work.\n\"There's nothing for us in our country,\" said Guerrero, who used to sell beans in Honduras.\nMexican authorities say that migrants must have valid documents in order to be admitted into the country.\nOn Friday evening, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said he had spoken to his Guatemalan counterpart Jimmy Morales for clearance to send civil protection personnel to help the Hondurans and to find transport for those wanting to return.\n\"We'll continue this operation for as long as is necessary,\" Hernandez said in a post on Twitter.\nShortly afterwards, Guatemala's government tweeted that Hernandez would meet Morales on Saturday in Guatemala City to implement a strategy for returning the Honduran migrants.\nMeanwhile, in a late televised address, outgoing Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto called the mass rush to penetrate the border \"unprecedented\", accusing some migrants of attacking police.\n\"Mexico does not and will not allow (people) to enter its territory illegally, let alone violently,\" he said.\nA similar caravan of Central Americans that formed in southern Mexico in late March also drew the ire of Trump, who on Thursday threatened to use the military and close the southern border if Mexico did not halt the new march.\nSuch a move would cause chaos on the crossing, one of the world's busiest, and badly disrupt trade.\nSpeaking in Scottsdale, Arizona on Friday, Trump said he \"appreciated very much\" Mexico's efforts to stop the caravan.\n\"If that doesn't work out, we're calling up the military - not the (National) Guard - we're calling up the military,\" he told reporters. \"They're not coming into this country.\"\nTrump has also threatened to cut off aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador - some of the poorest and most violent countries in the Americas - if they fail to prevent undocumented immigrants from heading to the United States.\nIn a tweet Thursday he had praised Mexico for its decision to send riot police to halt the progress of the caravan.\nTheir emigrants make up the bulk of people now caught trying to enter the United States illegally every year.\nSeveral migrants at the Guatemala-Mexico border spoke of entire neighborhoods leaving their homes to join the trek after news circulated on social media of a call for a new \"caravan\" to Mexico six months after the previous one."

            "The TTC Board has unanimously voted for the 10-cent fare increase this year.\nAccording to the transit agency, it needs $33.5 billion over the next 15 years to meet its capital needs.\nThe price increase would mean that tokens and Presto fares would go up to $3.10, from its current $3. But the change won\u2019t affect cash fares, which will remain at $3.25.\nThe price hike is set to go into effect on April 1, 2019, and this, the TTC said, would generate $26 million in revenue.\nThe TTC is also asking for an increase of $22 million in city funding.\nSee also\nThe vote comes during one of the TTC\u2019s worst weeks for commuters so far this winter.\nThe transit agency has encountered several delays since Monday, partly due to weather and partly due to signal problems.\n\u201cToday\u2019s delays should be a wake-up call to Mayor John Tory and Premier Doug Ford. Transit riders are paying the price for chronic underfunding,\u201d said TTCriders Executive Director Shelagh Pizey-Allen. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the city and province to properly fund the TTC to fix overcrowding and make transit affordable.\u201d\nThe advocacy group is opposing the TTC\u2019s fare increase, and is warning that delays and overcrowding will worsen if the province uploads the subway system from the city.\n\u201cThe total unfunded cost of capital investments to maintain the existing subway system and stations over the next 15 years is $16.18 billion,\u201d said the TTCriders. \u201cBut the provincial government has said it would only provide $160 million annually for subway maintenance if it takes ownership of TTC subways, leaving $920 million unfunded.\u201d\nThe TTC is the least-subsidized major transit system in North America, according to the group."

            "Fiona's life as she knows it is over.\nShameless Season 9 Episode 10 started with my favorite Gallagher realizing the error of her ways, striving for change, but in a much worse position by the final scene.\nLet's start with that dark opening scene. It was dumb of Fiona to leave the money out while the cafe was still open. There's no getting away from that.\nI thought the money would be gone when she returned, but that would have been too predictable. The three men were menacing, and there's no telling what they would have done if the other staff member did not show up to save the day.\nThe truth is, Fiona's been getting so drunk that she no longer knows fact from fiction. That scenario at Patsy's gave her the nudge in the right direction she needed.\nWelcome to the South Side, bitch. Fiona Permalink: Welcome to the South Side, bitch.\nPermalink: Welcome to the South Side, bitch.\nShe was finally taking accountability for her actions. It gave me hope that Fiona was getting a happy ending what with Emmy Rossum's departure looming.\nMargo was right to fire her. She's gotten erratic. She's gotten drunk on the job; she's been ridiculing customers, yelling at staff members, and even accusing people of sexual misconduct.\nIt's surprising that it took Margo a month of complaints to make a decision. Then again, the business guru knows Fiona has helped the diner turn in a profit like never before.\nMargo may not have picked up the phone, but that's probably because she was giving Fiona time to get it together. It's just a shame that Fiona took too long to sort herself out.\nFiona: I've had a rough few months, but I've turned a corner.\nMargo: People who say they've turned a corner, they haven't turned a corner. Permalink: People who say they've turned a corner, they haven't turned a corner.\nPermalink: People who say they've turned a corner, they haven't turned a corner.\nThrowing the vodka out was a great start. I thought for sure Frank would have been able to sniff that all the way from the Hobo Loco Hunger Games.\nRelated: Get Showtime via Prime Video Channels for Award-Winning Original Series, Hit Movies, Sports & More!\nFiona rallying up the entire South Side to go to the new neighbor's door was the moment I realized there's no hope for Fiona, and she's going to find herself back in prison.\nIf Fiona felt so strongly that the woman called the cops on Liam because of his skin color, then she should have had a chat with the woman to find out what the real issue was.\nBringing an army to the woman's door, jumping over her fence and punching the woman so hard that she fell to the ground was not the right way to go about things.\nWaitress: Yo, wakey wakey.\nFiona: Get the fuck away from me.\nPermalink: Get the fuck away from me.\nPermalink: Get the fuck away from me.\nThere's no rooting for Fiona anymore. It hurts me to write that because she's my favorite character, but she's several zip codes away from the line she crossed back on Shameless Season 4 which almost resulted in Liam's death.\nI don't doubt for one minute that Fiona would rough someone up if they mess with her family, but that punch was built on the rage she was holding inside after being fired.\nKnowing that Fiona is reverting to her old ways, if the woman presses charges and this goes to trial, Fiona could be headed to jail. That would be a terrible goodbye for such a great character.\nShameless has an issue saying goodbye to its characters, so prison seems to be the place they're sent to in case the actors change course and decide to come back (I'm looking at you, Cameron Monaghan).\nHopefully, the powers that be craft a more meaningful conclusion for Fiona than being locked up. This journey we've traveled with her would be a waste if it ended with prison.\nRelated: Showtime at TCA: Shameless Renewed, The L Word Revived & More!\nAs for the Hobo Loco Hunger Games, I didn't find them funny. The series loves to poke fun at poverty-stricken families, but there has got to be laws against exploiting them in such a manner.\nHobo Loco put profit over ethics, and I couldn't shake that during all of the scenes with Frank fighting to the death to keep himself in the competition.\nFrank: That's the way we're going to play this thing?\nMickey: All's fair in love and hobo wars. Permalink: All's fair in love and hobo wars.\nPermalink: All's fair in love and hobo wars.\nThe only semi-enjoyable part of it all was Mickey wanting to join forces with Frank to share the winnings. In hindsight, Frank should have accepted that offer.\nIngrid was at home while all this was playing out, and I couldn't help but laugh as she tried to dole out therapy over the phone while Fiona was poking fun at her.\nFiona was right. It was bizarre to have someone who was not of sound mind doling out therapy over the phone -- in the Gallagher house no less.\nWith Katey Sagal signed to appear on an ABC pilot, it sounds like her character is not sticking around, so it wouldn't surprise me if she decides to move back in with her ex-husband and have the children with him.\nThey're looking for someone with no purpose in life. I've finally found my calling. Frank Permalink: They're looking for someone with no purpose in life. I've finally found my calling.\nPermalink: They're looking for someone with no purpose in life. I've finally found my calling.\nIngrid desperately wanted to believe that Frank was the man for her, but she's slowly starting to realize that he's only a short-term lover who will fleece her for every dollar she has.\nI'm just waiting for the scene in which it all comes out that Carl is the father to the children. That will likely be something Frank screams when Ingrid inevitably packs up shop to leave him behind.\nThen there's Tami. I wanted to hate her because of the way she ridiculed Lip. She was so self-absorbed initially that it seemed there was no personality there.\nRelated: Shameless Shocker: Emmy Rossum Leaving After Nine Seasons!\nThese past few episodes have shed light on her in a big way, and I'm now at the point that I want the character to have a more significant presence on the show.\nThe way she acted with Xan took Lip by surprise. It would have been perfectly natural for her to run off and leave Lip to deal with the kid.\nInstead, Tami couldn't have been more motherly. I thought Xan was gone, but it seems like her mother has run off once and for all, and I'm so here for Lip and Tami looking out for this kid.\n\"Los Diablos!\" felt like the Shameless we know and love. It's slowly getting back to the creative footing it was on a few years ago.\nOther tidbits from the episode:\nDebbie is poised to pull a robbery on Carl after Kelly complimented her ass. That's going to cause a lot of drama, but it's also going to be a fun storyline.\nSantiago is gone already! While I'm happy he's reuniting with his family, the storyline would have worked better as an arc that lasted more than a handful of episodes.\nCarl's new job was brutal. He needs to find something that won't end with him getting assaulted.\nWhat did you think of the episode? Is Fiona gearing up for a stint behind bars?\nHit the comments.\nRemember you can watch Shameless online right here via TV Fanatic.\nShameless continues Sundays at 9/8c on Showtime.\nLos Diablos!

            "The pilot of a US charter plane carrying 143 people that crashed into a US river says it is a miracle how well the situation ended.\nThe Boeing 737 was arriving from Guantanamo Bay when it went off the runway into the St Johns River just before 10pm Friday night (local time).\nFire and emergency crews rushed to the scene, however no critical injuries or deaths were reported, officials said.\nWatch the latest News on Channel 7 or stream for free on 7plus >>\nThe Jacksonville Sheriff\u2019s Office posted on Twitter that a marine unit responded to assist. The plane was in shallow water and not submerged. Everyone on the plane was alive and accounted for, the agency posted, with 21 adults transported to local hospitals in good condition.\nDespite initial reports that the plane was a commercial flight, it's since been confirmed that it was in fact a Miami Air chartered plane.\nOfficials are yet to suggest what may have caused the crash, however it's believed the heavy thunderstorms in the area likely contributed.\nThe Jacksonville County Sheriff's Office said 21 adults had been taken to hospital. It's understood four passengers suffered minor injuries.\nPassenger Cheryl Bormann told CNN that the plane \u201cbounced\" before it skidded off the runway.\n\u201cIt was terrifying,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut everybody we pretty calm...everybody helped everybody else.\u201d\nMiami Air International is a charter airline operating a fleet of Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Airline representatives could not immediately be reached for comment, while a Boeing spokesman said that the company was aware of the incident and was gathering information.\n'It was a miracle'\nCapt. Michael Connor, the commanding officer of NAS Jacksonville, said during a news conference that passengers were a mix of civilian and military personnel. Some were staying in the area, while others were set to fly on to other parts of the country.\nWhile the crash certainly wasn\u2019t ideal, Connor acknowledged that it could have been much worse.\n\u201cI think it is a miracle,\u201d Connor said. \u201cWe could be talking about a different story this evening.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t known how long it would take to remove the plane from the river, but Connor said the landing gear appeared to be resting on the river bed, making it unlikely for the aircraft to float away. He said crews began working to contain any jet fuel leaks almost immediately after securing the passengers\u2019 safety.\nLiz Torres told the Florida Times-Union that she heard what sounded like a gunshot Friday night from her home in Orange Park, about 8 kilometres south of NAS Jacksonville. She then drove down to a Target parking lot where police and firefighters were staging to find out more.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d she said."

            "It\u2019s official: low-wage workers in Ontario are losing their two thousand dollar raise\nDoug Ford Just Cancelled Ontario\u2019s Minimum Wage Increase. Low-Wage Workers Are Out $2,000 Per Year.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford\u2019s government has announced it is cancelling the province\u2019s planned minimum wage increase to $15 per hour.\nDuring a press conference Wednesday, Ford\u2019s Labour Minister Laurie Scott was asked directly by reporters what a minimum wage employee in Ontario will earn as of January 1, 2019.\n\u201cThe minimum wage is going to be paused at $14 an hour,\u201d Scott said.\nAlthough reporters noted this year\u2019s minimum wage increase did not cause job losses in the service sector or other low-wage industries, Ford\u2019s labour minister insisted the minimum wage increase has \u201churt job creation in the province.\u201d\nFord\u2019s move to scrap the minimum wage increase means Ontario\u2019s low-wage workers will see nearly two thousand dollars less in their pockets ($1,899) next year than they would have had the $15 minimum wage increase gone through as planned.\nAnd the latest evidence from other places that have moved rapidly to a $15/hr minimum wage (some raising it by more and faster than Ontario) is good news for all: \u201csignificant pay increases and no significant employment reductions\u201d https://t.co/Jk6bek4KcW #15andFairness \u2014 Michal Rozworski (@michalrozworski) September 26, 2018\nScott attempted to argue that scrapping the minimum wage raise would be offset by a tax credit aimed at low-wage workers, although Scott could not say when the tax credit would actually be rolled out.\nHowever, economists point out Ford\u2019s tax credit, if it ever happens, actually leave low-wage workers with a one thousand dollar hole in their pockets.\nAccording to an analysis by economist Sheila Block, Ford\u2019s tax credit would only save low-wage workers $817 a year, which does not come close to offsetting the loss of $1,899 raise by clawing back the minimum wage.\nIn other words, even if Ford balances out the minimum wage cut with a tax credit, low-wage workers still lose out a staggering $1,082 per year."

            "Microsoft is launching its collaborative Whiteboard app on Windows 10 today, and promising versions for iOS and the web soon. The app has been in preview for Windows 10 for the past seven months, and it\u2019s now being made widely available on PCs alongside a new version for the web and iOS devices. Whiteboard lets users make notes on a virtual whiteboard that can be shared and edited with others in real time across devices.\nAnyone can download the app and begin collaborating with other users. If you sign into the app with an Office 365 work or school account then you can also collaborate with multiple people within that organization. Whiteboard supports inking on Windows 10 so styluses like the Surface Pen can be used for collaborative inking, geometry recognition, table conversion, and automatic table shading. Whiteboard users have been using the app to write out process flows, create tables collaboratively, and brainstorm presentations.\nWhile an iOS app is debuting soon, the Whiteboard team is also working on an Android version for the future. It\u2019s not clear exactly when that will be available, but the web version of Whiteboard will work on Android mobile devices in the mean time. Microsoft hasn\u2019t restricted its Whiteboard app to any particular browser either, and all major browsers are supported.\nThere\u2019s no technical limitation on how many people can collaborate on Whiteboard, but Microsoft is strangely limiting the web and iOS versions to an Office 365 commercial account at the moment. Whiteboard participants don\u2019t need to use a stylus to draw or annotate, keyboard input and touchscreens are also supported so all modern devices will be able to make use of the app. Microsoft is also planning to integrate Whiteboard into its Microsoft Teams chat app, and bring the app to its Surface Hub device.\nWhiteboard is based on Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Intentional Software last year, and the software maker has been working to integrate this software into Microsoft\u2019s products. Intentional Software was founded by Charles Simonyi, who was a former chief software architect at Microsoft. Simonyi left Microsoft in 2002 after helping create Office apps like Excel and Word."

            "There is plenty of starting-level talent for the start of the second round of the 2019 NFL Draft.\nBut perhaps the most interesting player available probably isn\u2019t a starter. That would be Missouri quarterback Drew Lock. He\u2019s a player with first-round talent, but he dropped out of the top 32. With a few teams in the top half of the second round needing a quarterback, Lock may not need to wait long to get picked.\nThe second round could feature some runs on certain positions. In the mock below, for instance, three of the first four picks are cornerbacks. That includes players like Greedy Williams of LSU, Byron Murphy of Washington, and Rock Ya-Sin of Temple. Murphy comes in as the best available player remaining.\nRelated The best available players after the 1st round of the NFL Draft\nWe should see offensive tackles like Cody Ford of Oklahoma and Jawaan Taylor of Florida come off the board pretty early.\nThe other position of intrigue is wide receiver. Except for Baltimore taking Marquise Brown at No. 25 and New England taking N\u2019Keal Harry at No. 32, there was no action at wide receiver Thursday night. Starting with the Ole Miss pair of D.K. Metcalf and A.J. Brown, don\u2019t be surprised if five or more wide receivers get taken in the second round.\nHere\u2019s where they could land:\n33. Arizona Cardinals: Greedy Williams, CB, LSU\n34.

Metcalf, WR, Ole Miss\n41. Denver Broncos: Drew Lock, QB, Missouri\n42. Cincinnati Bengals: Mack Wilson, LB, Alabama\n43. Detroit Lions: Sean Bunting, CB, Central Michigan\n44. Green Bay Packers: Dalton Risner, OL, Kansas State\n45. Los Angeles Rams: Erik McCoy, C, Texas A&M\n46. Indianapolis Colts: Justin Layne, CB, Michigan State\n47.

            "Love Island is almost upon us and we're already envisioning sunshine, ripped muscles, this year's version of Muggy Mike getting pied, and infinity pools with a background chorus of \"100% my type on paper\".\nUnsexy stuff such as hand sanitisers and pouring rain don't spring to mind - but both are very real issues behind the scenes of the hit ITV2 show.\nWe went to Mallorca to check out the villa, get some backstage gossip, meet the new contestants, and chat to the show's very bronzed host Caroline Flack.\nUnfortunately, it rained quite viciously from the moment we landed and continued most of the day, although the sun eventually did come out when we finally got to the famous villa. We're putting that down to another Love Island miracle.\nHere's everything we learned ahead of the new series - including a solution to bad weather and a condom count. You're welcome.\n1. Everyone who arrives at the villa must use hand sanitiser\nGiphy\nPassing round a communal hand sanitiser in the coach enforced by security immediately brought us back down to earth as we arrived for our tour of the sprawling villa.\nWe're told it's a precautionary measure to kill all viruses so that the cast and crew don't get ill.\n2. Some lucky cleaner gets to change the bed sheets...\nGiphy\nKeeping it as sexy as the show, the producers informed us that the cleaners come once a week, during which they also change the sheets. Bruto.\n3. There isn\u2019t a limit to alchohol\nITV2\nThere's been lots of conflicting reports of how much booze is actually permitted in the villa, with Kady telling us last year that they were usually allowed two glasses a night.\nHowever, producers told us that there is no limit, although they do keep an eye on booze intake.\n\"We monitor things,\" a producer explained. \"They can have a drink but we're really careful that they don't have too much. There's no limit... We judge on a case by case basis but we're responsible about it.\"\n4. Makeup and clothes are available for the Islanders\nGiphy\nMissguided clothes and Rimmel makeup products will be available in the villa for the Islanders to help themselves to if they so fancy.\n5. This is how many condoms are available to the Islanders\nGiphy\n200. And the branded kind, of course.\n6. It never rains on Love Island\nGiphy\nOr so producers joked. If it does pour down, it's likely they'll edit around the weather and we'll probably see more footage of the Islanders inside the villa.\n7. The Islanders make their own breakfast and lunch\nITV\nBut their dinner - like the crew's - is prepared by caterers.\n8. A dumped Islander could return a la Muggy Mike\nITV\nWe could see a rejected Islander come back to the show after the sheer brilliance of Mike's unforeseen resurrection.\n\"We only felt comfortable doing that off the back of a public vote,\" a producer explained. \"So we knew that the viewers were happy to endorse it.\"\n9. Danny Dyer could be making a cameo\nGetty Images\nIslander and former Survival Of The Fittest star Dani Dyer said her famous EastEnders dad Danny Dyer could end up making an appearance on the show during the family reunion segment.\n10. Chris Pine most definitely won't be turning up, mind you...\nImeh Akpanudosen Getty Images\nIslander Samira Mighty revealed she went on a date with Chris a couple of years ago and that they're still in touch. So much so the Hollywood actor even asked the West End performer if she was around to hangout this summer.\nSadly, Chris got pied for Love Island.\n\"He texts me now and then, just to let me know he's there,\" she said. \"He was like, 'oh my gosh, I'm here over summer, let's hangout.' But I'm on the show! He would never go on the show! He was like, ahh, 'Ok. I was like, cool'. End of friendship end of convo!\"\nLol\n11. Some of the contestants auditioned, and some were scouted on Instagram\nITV\nA couple of the Islanders applied the usual way by sending a video in, but others were contacted by producers or casting agents to take part via social media.\nModel Hayley Hughes told us: \"[Producers] had contacted me previous years, but I\u2019ve had boyfriends. They contacted me on social media on Instagram.\n\"I was flattered - to be fair, it was a week before closing that they contacted me, so I haven't really had time to think about it.\"\nThey also sometimes find eligible people for the show via their friends and who they\u2019re following on social media.\n12. The casting team meet around 1000 people before they're narrowed down to make the cast\nITV\nAnd the casting team will continue to consider contestants pretty much up until the show ends.\nWe're still in with a chance...\nLove Island begins on Monday 4th June. AND WE CANNOT WAIT!"

This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. You can unsubscribe at any time. More info\nRobert wowed the judges and viewers alike with his fast-paced comedy routine on Britain\u2019s Got Talent. His efforts saw him get through to tonight\u2019s final with a shot at taking home the title of the ITV variety competition. He was even pegged as a bookies favourite, however, it\u2019s all changed at the last minute. While he was comfortably sitting at the top spot, he\u2019s now been overtaken by fellow funnyman Lost Voice Guy. Support has surged for the comic, who lost his ability to speak as a result of cerebral palsy, meaning Robert\u2019s got a big rival.\nLost Voice Guy, real name Lee Ridley, is now the 11/8 favourite to win, while Robert now sits in third place with odds of 7/2. A spokesman for BoyleSports said: \u201cMere hours before Lost Voice Guy and the rest of the Britain\u2019s Got Talent finalists take to the stage and make their bids for the title, punters have reignited their love for the comedian and backed him into 11/8 from 15/8 seeing him back as the favourite to win having lost out on the spot to Robert White. \u201cRobert White\u2019s odds have been pushed right out to 7/2 from 7/4 which doesn\u2019t bode well for the West Sussex comedian.\u201d Filling in the second slot is Diversity prot\u00e9g\u00e9s DVJ who appear to be Lost Voice Guy\u2019s main competition. Robert was at the centre of some drama earlier this week after Big Narstie was seen shoving him on sister show Britain\u2019s Got More Talent.\nBritain's Got Talent final: Robert White could be in trouble tonight\nViewers were deeply concerned about the contestant, who later verified there was no bad blood between himself and the rapper. He confirmed on his Twitter account: \u201cBig Narstie hi-fived, shook and then made up. No bad feelings from me. \u201cTo me the visual joke was obvious; the tiny guy dancing with the big guy, but not everyone thinks in comedy, so I think you should give the benefit of the doubt #bgmt.\u201d Big Narstie later took to the social network to apologise, he wrote: \u201cHello high to the world, sorry if I came across aggressively last night. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t like my personal space being invaded in that manner [I] just followed natural reaction #BGMT God bless everyone, all love.\u201d\nBritain's Got Talent final: Lost Voice Guy could pip Robert to the post\nBritain's Got Talent final: DVJ have come out in second place in bookies' rankings"

            "Dr. Ford did not attend one of those schools. She attended an independent private school named Holton-Arms and she was a year behind me. She and I did not travel in the same social circles. It\u2019s possible we met at some point at some events, although I do not recall that. To repeat, all of the people identified by Dr. Ford as being present at the party have said they do not remember any such party ever happening. Importantly, her friend, Ms. Keyser, has not only denied knowledge of the party, Ms. Keyser said under penalty of felony, she does not know me. Does not recall ever being at a party with me ever. And my two male friends who were allegedly there, who knew me well, have told this committee under penalty of felony that they don\u2019t recall any such party and I never did or never would do anything like this.\nDr. Ford\u2019s allegation is not merely uncorroborated, it is refuted by the very people she says were there, including by a longtime friend of hers. Refuted. Third, Dr. Ford has said that this event occurred at a house near Columbia Country Club, which is at the corner of Connecticut Avenue and East West highway in Chevy Chase, Md. In her letter to Senator Feinstein, she said there were four other people at the house. But none of those people, nor I, lived near Columbia Country Club. As of the summer of 1982, Dr. Ford was 15 and could not drive yet. And she did not live near Columbia Country Club. She says confidently that she had one beer at the party. But she does not say how she got to the house in question or how she got home or whose house it was.\nFourth, I have submitted to this committee detailed calendars recording my activities in the summer of 1982. Why did I keep calendars? My dad started keeping detailed calendars of his life in 1978. He did so as both a calendar and a diary. He\u2019s a very organized guy, to put it mildly. Christmastime, we sat around and he would tell old stories. Old milestones, old weddings, old events from his calendars.\nIn ninth grade \u2014 in ninth grade in 1980, I started keeping calendars of my own. For me also, it\u2019s both a calendar and a diary. I\u2019ve kept such calendar diaries for the last 38 years. Mine are not as good as my dad\u2019s, in some years, and when I was a kid, the calendars are about what you would expect from a kid. Some goofy parts, some embarrassing parts. But I did have the summer of 1982 documented pretty well.\nThe event described by Dr. Ford presumably happened on a weekend because I believe everyone worked and had jobs in the summers. In any event, a drunken early evening event of the kind she describes presumably happened on a weekend. If it was a weekend, my calendars show that I was out of town almost every weekend night before football training camp started in late August. The only weekend nights that I was in D.C. were Friday, June 4, when I was with my dad at a pro-golf tournament and had my high school achievement test at 8:30 the next morning. I also was in D.C. on Saturday night, Aug. 7, but I was at a small gathering at Becky\u2019s house in Rockville with Matt, Denise, Lori and Jenny. Their names are all listed on my calendar. I won\u2019t use their last names here. And then on the weekend of Aug. 20 to 22, I was staying at the Garretts\u2019 with Pat and Chris as we did final preparations for football training camp that began on Sunday the 22nd.\nAs the calendars confirm, that weekend before a brutal football training camp schedule was no time for parties. So let me emphasize this point: If the party described by Dr. Ford happened in the summer of 1982 on a weekend night, my calendar shows all but definitively I was not there. During the weekdays in the summer of 1982, as you can see, I was out of town for two weeks of the summer for a trip to the beach with friends and at the legendary five-star basketball camp in Honesdale, Pa.\nWhen I was in town, I spent much of my time working, working out, lifting weights, playing basketball or hanging out and having some beers with friends as we talked about life and football and school and girls. Some have noticed I didn\u2019t have church on Sundays on my calendars. I also didn\u2019t list brushing my teeth and for me, going to church on Sundays was like brushing my teeth. Automatic. Still is."

        "articles": [
            "It started in a pub. A handful of people, hunched over beers in Toledo, Ohio, were talking about a water crisis that had plagued the city in 2014. The pollution of Lake Erie had gotten so bad that it had taken a serious toll on their lives. The government, they felt, wasn\u2019t doing enough to protect the lake. And so they wondered: What if the lake could protect itself?\nThe idea they hatched that night ultimately resulted in a special election, which had the citizens of Toledo voting February 26 on a very unusual question: Should Lake Erie be granted the legal rights normally reserved for a person?\nThe measure passed easily, which means citizens will be able to sue on behalf of the lake whenever its right to flourish is being contravened \u2014 that is, whenever it\u2019s in danger of major environmental harm.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nervous energy,\u201d Tish O\u2019Dell, who was at the pub that fateful night, told me while traveling between different polling places in Toledo on the morning of the vote. She was on tenterhooks as she waited for the election results. \u201cIt\u2019s like torture.\u201d\nIf the stakes felt almost unbearably high for the activists who pushed for the Lake Erie Bill of Rights, it\u2019s because this was the first rights-based legislation aimed at protecting a whole US ecosystem: the lake, its tributaries, and the many species that live off it.\nThe law isn\u2019t without precedent, though. It\u2019s part of the nascent rights of nature movement, which has notched several victories in the past dozen years. Rivers and forests have already won legal rights in countries like Ecuador, Colombia, India, and New Zealand.\nActivists in the movement often argue that the environment is the next frontier in humanity\u2019s expanding moral circle: over the centuries, we\u2019ve extended rights to more and more beings, so why shouldn\u2019t nature itself be next?\nThey reject the conventional Western way of relating to nature \u2014 as property that is ours for the taking, as an object rather than a subject \u2014 but they recognize they\u2019re going to have to work within the existing Western legal system if they want that to change. They\u2019re betting that the best strategy for protecting the environment is to stretch our society\u2019s understanding of what counts as a person. It\u2019s a bold bet, but with climate change decimating the planet at such a ferocious rate, it might be the kind of innovative thinking we need.\nHow the rights of nature idea took off\nIn 1972, the case of Sierra Club v. Morton came before the US Supreme Court, leading to a deliberation over whether nature should have its own rights. The Court decided the answer was no, but Justice William O. Douglas dissented. \u201cContemporary public concern for protecting nature\u2019s ecological equilibrium,\u201d he wrote, \u201cshould lead to the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation.\u201d\nThat same year, law professor Christopher Stone made a splash with an article titled \u201cShould trees have standing?\u201d It catalyzed other academics to write a slew of articles and books considering whether natural environments ought to have rights enshrined in law.\nIn 2006, that question left the ether of academia and came to bear directly on toxic sewage sludge, which had been dumped in Tamaqua, Pennsylvania. Residents fought for \u2014 and won \u2014 the first-ever rights of nature law in the world. Two years later, Ecuador became the first country to enshrine the rights of nature in its constitution, thanks in large part to the work of indigenous activists.\nSince then, the victories have come fast and furious. In 2014, New Zealand recognized the legal rights of the Te Urewera forest. In 2017, Colombia granted rights to the Rio Atrato river and India recognized the Ganges and Yamuna rivers as legal persons. In 2018, the Amazon rainforest got its own rights, and for the first time, so did a specific plant species: the wild rice known as manoomin, one of the Anishinaabe people\u2019s staple crops.\nGranting the status of personhood to a natural environment may seem like a bizarre legal fiction, but it\u2019s no more bizarre than the idea that corporations should enjoy that same status, which has been with us since the 1880s.\nIf we find it strange to view nature the way we view people, that may just be because we\u2019ve grown up in an anthropocentric intellectual tradition that treats the natural world as an object to be examined and exploited for human use, rather than as a subject to be communed with and respected.\n\u201cThe idea that we can be separate from nature is really a Western reductionist way of looking at the world \u2014 we can trace it back to Francis Bacon and the scientific method,\u201d said Ben Price, the national director for the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund, a nonprofit public interest law firm that helps people facing threats to their local environment.\nPrice told me that just as women\u2019s suffrage or the abolition of slavery were once unthinkable but gradually became accepted and normalized, the rights of nature idea seems wacky now but will eventually gain social currency. \u201cFor the rights of nature to be understood and become something we\u2019re comfortable with is going require a paradigm shift, just like the end of slavery did,\u201d he said.\nThat paradigm shift may entail nothing less than a total rejection of capitalism, according to Eduardo Gudynas, the executive secretary of the Latin American Center for Social Ecology in Uruguay. He argues that attempts to reduce environmental devastation while staying within a capitalism framework won\u2019t be enough to address the climate crisis.\n\u201cThe debate around the rights of nature is one of the most active frontlines in the fight for a non-market-based point of view,\u201d Gudynas told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a reaction against our society\u2019s commodification of everything.\u201d\nWill this legal strategy be effective?\nThe rights of nature movement has inspired new legislation around the world, but because it\u2019s still in its infancy, we don\u2019t yet have evidence about how much of a practical difference those laws will really make.\nEcuador, however, offers one example of concrete change. After the country enshrined the rights of nature in its constitution, locals have brought lawsuits against companies they say are causing serious environmental harm. In one recent case, people sued on behalf of a river that was being polluted in the course of a construction project. The court ruled in the river\u2019s favor.\nThat outcome is inspiring to people like O\u2019Dell in Toledo. And now that Lake Erie has joined the ranks of natural environments with legal rights, the activists in the rights of nature movement are buoyed at the prospect of what comes next.\n\u201cThere are many different effects we hope for,\u201d O\u2019Dell said. \u201cOne is education \u2014 that you open people\u2019s eyes to this possibility. Two is to give notice to those doing the environmental harm that we\u2019re not going to tolerate this anymore. Three is the hope that other people will follow you on the path you\u2019ve started to clear.\u201d\nTo Price, that last hope rises to the level of an existential need, given the pace of climate change. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the results of our narrow-mindedness, of our belief that nature is property and property ownership is the highest right,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hope is that by beginning somewhere, like Toledo, the conversation enlarges. You never know what\u2019s going to be the tipping point.\u201d\nSign up for the Future Perfect newsletter. Twice a week, you\u2019ll get a roundup of ideas and solutions for tackling our biggest challenges: improving public health, decreasing human and animal suffering, easing catastrophic risks, and \u2014 to put it simply \u2014 getting better at doing good."

Football fans and their friends will gather around the TV on Sunday, February 3 to watch the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams face off for Super Bowl LIII.\nWhether you're there for the football, the halftime show, or to watch Super Bowl ads, everyone can agree on one thing: the food is one great reason for everyone to come together and watch the game.\nWhile there are plenty of restaurants and recipes to make for the big game, the ultimate Super Bowl food everyone can agree on is pizza. Newsweek has created a round-up of chain pizza restaurants that are serving some deals just for the big game:\nPapa John's: The pizza chain is offering five different party deals ranging from $45 to $70. The $45 option called the MVP includes five large one-topping pizzas and two Pepsi two-liter sodas that can feed 10 to 15 people. The largest pizza deal option called the Fan Feast includes five large one-topping pizzas with three bread sides and three desserts for $70.\n\"With party deals to choose from, the game is in your hands.

Pizza Hut is giving away a free pizza and two Super Bowl tickets to the first family who gives birth to their child right after kickoff, according to a press release.\n\"If there's one thing we're more passionate about than pizza and football, it's the family we get to enjoy it with,\" said Marianne Radley, chief brand officer, Pizza Hut. \"Family celebrations and Pizza Hut have gone hand in hand for more than 60 years, so in our first year as the Official Pizza Sponsor at Super Bowl LIII, we wanted to show up for our fans who are in the unique position of expanding their family during the biggest NFL game of the year. And as a mother of four, I would've jumped at the idea of free, post-delivery pizza at the hospital!\"\nDomino's: A representatives from the pizza chain told Newsweek that they will be serving their evergreen deals, which you can find here. The pizza company has also launched Points for Pies which will offer customers loyalty points for consuming any kind of pizza, starting February 2.\n\"Instead of advertising during Sunday's game, we decided to invest in a breakthrough program that rewards everyone who loves pizza as much as we do,\" said Art D'Elia, Domino's senior vice president and chief brand officer in a statement. \"We know everyone is asking themselves, 'Did Domino's just say they will award points for eating ANY pizza? Even from a competitor?' You read that right; oh yes we did!\"\nPilot Flying J: The pizza chain is offering a free slice of pizza from February 3 to February 10 if customers order through the Pilot J app. First-time app users will also receive a free drink of their choice when they download the app."

            "Google Maps is probably one of the company\u2019s most-used and more-adored products, and it\u2019s always getting updated to try and improve things for the better. Today, Google is announcing a slew of new features for Maps users including a new \u201cCommute\u201d tab.\nThe Commute tab for Maps first popped up in a limited rollout in early September, but starting today it\u2019s rolling out to users on Android and iOS. Google says that this new feature is designed to help you \u201ctake control over your commute.\u201d It built the feature with the fact that, in many cities across North America, rush hour traffic can result in a commute that takes up to 60% longer than expected.\nWith the new Commute tab, Google Maps can provide live data on traffic to help you best manage your daily trip to work. It automatically accounts for accidents or heavy traffic and can help you better budget your time to account for that or provide alternate routes. Android users will have notifications on these updates sent to their device before getting caught in the delay.\nThis new tab also better accounts for users who use mixed transportation. If you both drive in a personal vehicle and take public transit, Google Maps can display information for each leg of the trip include departure times for buses and trains.\nYou can see helpful information about when to leave, and for each leg of your trip: you\u2019ll know if there\u2019s traffic on your drive, when the next train departs, and how long it\u2019ll take to walk from the train station to the office. We do the work for you and automatically factor this into your ETA so you can anticipate exactly when you\u2019ll get to work.\nGoogle has also worked with public transit in 80 regions around the globe to start providing real-time location data on subways, trains, and buses. Better yet, Google Maps users in Sydney will be able to see just how full their bus or train is, and this feature is promised for more cities around the world.\nNow, transit riders in 80 regions worldwide will be able to see exactly where their bus or train is in real time on the map. This will help you plan your day more efficiently\u2014you\u2019ll know if you can spend an extra few minutes grabbing coffee, or if you really do need to make a run for it to catch your bus.\nFinally, Google Maps is also adding direct integration with popular music services. Spotify, Apple Music, and Google Play Music will all be available directly within Google Maps\u2019 navigation screen. With Spotify on Android, users will also be able to browse through their songs and playlists too.\nAll of these new features start rolling out to users starting this week on both Android and iOS.\nMore on Google Maps:\nCheck out 9to5Google on YouTube for more news:\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

More info\nDestroyer follows the moral and existential odyssey of LAPD detective Erin Bell. As a young cop, Bell was placed undercover with a gang in the California desert with tragic results. When the leader of that gang re-emerges many years later, she must work her way back through the remaining members and into her own history with them to finally reckon with the demons that destroyed her past.\nWhat do critics say about Destroyer? The neo-noir thriller directed by Karyn Kusama has received a respectable 71 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes. The critics' consensus reads: Destroyer's gruelling narrative is as uncompromising as Nicole Kidman's central performance, which adds extra layers to a challenging film that leaves a lingering impact. Jake Coyle for Associated Press: While \"Destroyer\" can be overwrought and mechanical, it's an often gripping, well-crafted crime drama with a distinction of its own in the genre, an almost always male-dominated one. Rafer Guzman for Newsday: \"Destroyer\" is a worthwhile film, especially for moviegoers who love film noir in all its phases: The hard-boiled Bogart era, the nihilist takes of the 1960s and '70s, the neon-lit productions of the '80s. VICE REVIEWS: WHAT DO CRITICS SAY ABOUT DICK CHENEY MOVIE?\nDestroyer: The Nicole Kidman thriller has a positive 71 percent on Rotten Tomatoes\nGary M. Kramer for Salon.com: Despite the film's uneven qualities, \"Destroyer\" is compelling because of Kidman's unflinching performance. The actress appears in every scene, and it's impossible to take one's eye off her. She exudes a fierce determination that is alluring. Peter Travers for Rolling Stone: Nicole Kidman, playing a burned-out LAPD cop, proves she's as an actress who knows how to stay the course, no matter how twisty, tangled or down and dirty it gets. She's dynamite. BUMBLEBEE REVIEWS: WHAT DO CRITICS SAY ABOUT THE TRANSFORMERS PREQUEL?\nManohla Dargis for the New York Times: Kusama is still figuring out how to balance form and pulp, but she has a singular unapologetic idea about what women can and cannot do onscreen, one she lets rip with verve and her superbly unbound star. Mark Kennedy for Associated Press: It's been a while since we've had a Los Angeles on the screen like this one. Rachel Leishman for The Mary Sue: Destroyer is hands down the best work Kidman has done yet, unafraid of inhabiting this incredibly raw character-one who is trying to understand pain in a new way, and it's definitely a movie you don't want to miss. IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK REVIEWS: WHAT DO CRITICS HAVE TO SAY?\nDestroyer: Critics were over-all pleased with the movie by Karyn Kusama\nSara Stewart the New York Post: The particulars of the story are typical for the genre - a heist gone wrong, a slippery crime boss - but they're elevated to visceral levels by Kidman's hard-core performance... Bilge Ebiri for New York Magazine/Vulture: Kidman's performance as this broken, obsessed woman is powerful. Breathless, rasping through her teeth, she conveys both vulnerability and intractability. April Wolfe for TheWrap: Despite the film's needlessly fractured structure and a relentlessly grim story, Kidman and Kusama seem to be speaking the same language, illuminating the faults of the protagonist and of every tragic hard-boiled detective in cinematic history. Linda Holmes for NPR: Rarely are women cast in these roles of screwed-up, hard-boiled antiheroes with a lifetime of regrets to make up for, and even if this is your basic LA noir, it's well-executed and satisfying in all the ways it should be.\nDestroyer: Nicole Kidman (L) with director Karyn Kusama (R) have been praised for their work"

            "Kerala church sex-for-silence case: Survivor tells cops how her story unfolded from 1999\nPolice officers told TNM that her declaration to the Church will not stand in a court of law.\nnews Crime\nThe controversy surrounding sexual abuse allegations against five priests of Malankara Orthodox Church in Kerala has turned murkier.\nOn Monday, Mathrubhumi News aired portions of a declaration said to be hand-written by the survivor, in which she mentions five priests of the Orthodox church.\nThis document was reportedly given to the Church by her husband along with his complaint two months ago.\nHowever, a senior police officer with the Kerala Crime Branch who is part of the investigation told TNM that the statement will not stand in a court of law. He added that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeclaration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that hinted at consensual relationships was only half the truth as there are clear signs of abuse in each of these \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrelationships\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\n\"This declaration cannot be considered as proof, it is only one that was given to the Church. We have recorded the survivor's detailed statement, in which she has said that one of the priests threatened her using her confession statement, based on which, we have booked them,\" the officer said.\nThe survivor had on Sunday given a statement to the Crime Branch, that is investigating the case.\nA senior officer in the Crime Branch, part of the investigation team that has now booked four priests for rape and molestation, however said that the declaration given to the Church does not hold any legal importance.\nAccording to sources in the Crime Branch, the survivor's relationship (prior to her wedding) with Fr Abraham Varghese began in 1999. She was a minor then and Abraham was studying to be a priest.\nThough the priest got married, he wanted her to continue the relationship, according to her statement. It went on after her wedding too.\nIn 2009, during her child's baptism, she reportedly confessed to another priest about her relationship with Fr Abraham Varghese. He in turn, is alleged to have threatened her and demanded sexual favours.\nFollowing this, she confided in another priest Fr Job Mathew who was also her friend. TNM does not have details of the nature of her complaint against him.\nThe fourth priest that she has mentioned in her complaint is a counsellor who works with the church. During the course of counseling, this priest is also alleged to have sexually abused her.\nFrom December 2016 onwards, the counsellor had asked the woman to book themselves in five star hotels. The survivor told the police that unable to afford the hotel bills, she was even forced to borrow or steal money from her family.\nThe Crime Branch has booked four priests Fr Abraham Varghese, Fr Job Mathew, Fr Johnson Mathew and Fr Jaise George on charges of rape and molestation.\nAlso read: Kerala Orthodox church 'sex-for-silence' row: Crime Branch books 4 priests for rape"

            "Relatives react at the scene where the Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max 8 crashed shortly after takeoff on Sunday killing all 157 on board, near Bishoftu, south of Addis Ababa, in Ethiopia, March 13, 2019. (Photo: Mulugeta Ayene/AP)\nFlight recorders from a doomed Ethiopian Airlines flight arrived in France for analysis Thursday as frustrated relatives of the 157 people killed stormed out of a meeting with airline officials in Addis Ababa.\nSunday's crash was the second fatal flight for a Boeing 737 Max 8 in less than six months. More than 40 countries, including the U.S., have now grounded the planes or refused to let them into their airspace.\nAfter holding out for several days, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency order grounding the planes Wednesday, saying they had new satellite data and evidence that showed the movements of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 were similar to those of Lion Air Flight 610. That flight crashed into the Java Sea off Indonesia in October, killing 189 people.\nOfficials at Lion Air have said sensors on their plane produced erroneous information on its last four flights, triggering an automatic nose-down command that the pilots were unable to overcome on its final voyage.\nEthiopian Airlines CEO Tewolde Gebremariam said its pilots had received special training on how to deal with that problem.\n\"In addition to the basic trainings given for 737 aircraft types, an additional training was given for the Max version,\" Tewolde said. \"After the Lion Air crash, questions were raised, so Boeing sent further instructions that it said pilots should know.\"\nTwo men carry suitcases containing the flight recorders from the Ethiopian jet, into the French air accident investigation authority, March 14, 2019 Le Bourget, north of Paris. (Photo: Christophe Ena/AP)\nTewolde said he is confident the investigation will reveal that the crash is not related to the safety record of Ethiopian Airlines, widely seen as the best-managed in Africa.\nFirm answers about what caused the crash could take months. The French air accident investigation authority, known by its French acronym BEA, said Thursday it will handle the analysis of the flight recorders, often referred to as a plane's black boxes, retrieved from the crash site.\nThe BEA has experience with global air crashes, and its expertise is often sought whenever an Airbus plane crashes because the manufacturer is based in France. A BEA official told The Associated Press that the recorders have already arrived in France but gave no time frame on how long the analysis could take.\nStory continues\nIn Addis Ababa, about 200 angry family members of crash victims left a briefing with Ethiopian Airlines officials, saying that the carrier has not given them adequate information. Officials said they have opened a call-in center that is open 18 hours a day to respond to questions, but family members said they are not getting the answers they need. People from 35 countries died.\nAt the crash scene in Hejere, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Addis Ababa, growing numbers of family members arrived, some wailing or beating their chests as a bulldozer navigated piles of debris. Blue plastic sheeting covered the wreckage of the plane.

            "What started as an experiment to bring gaming features to the mobile world has now become a full-on trend. Last year, Razer introduced a phone with flagship specs and a high refresh rate display. Then, Nubia upped the ante by adding RGB lighting to its Red Magic handset. And now Asus has topped them all with the wildly ambitious but simply named ROG Phone.\nSporting a 6-inch 90Hz AMOLED screen and a glowing ROG logo with customizable lighting in the back, this upcoming phone has the highlight features from its predecessors covered, and Asus didn\u2019t stop there. The company crammed in vapor-chamber cooling (a feature normally reserved for gaming laptops), three USB-C ports (more on those later), and special touch-sensitive sides that can function as shoulder buttons while in landscape mode, or used to turn on the phone\u2019s gaming mode by simply squeezing the device.\nOn the inside, Asus blew out the device\u2019s specs with 8GB of RAM, up to 512GB of storage, a big \u2018ole 4,000 mAH battery, and an overclocked Snapdragon 845 chip that can hit 2.96Ghz instead of Qualcomm\u2019s usual 2.8Ghz max. The ROG Phone even supports 802.11 WiGig connectivity, so you can stream gameplay wirelessly to a nearby TV or monitor using Asus\u2019 companion WiGig Dock. In short, the ROG Phone might just be the most powerful Android phone on the planet.\nAdvertisement\nNow back to those extra USB-C ports. When looking at the phone in portrait mode, there\u2019s one USB-C port (and a handy headphone jack) down at the bottom for typical stuff like charging and data transfer. But then on the sides of the device, there are two more USB-C ports so that when you\u2019re gaming, you can hold the phone in landscape mode and still have somewhere to plug in a power cable without messing up your grip.\nG/O Media may get a commission 10% off 10% off Wish A gift for literally everybody.\nGifts under $20, $10, and even $5. It\u2019s Wish, the catch-all shop for all of the above. Buy at Wish Advertisement\nI\u2019m a big fan of the idea, because in a world where a lot of mainstream phone makers are ditching the headphone jack, putting two or more USB-C ports on the device is a simple and also utilitarian way of letting people connect multiple accessories so you can do things like recharge your device and use headphones at the same time. And for the ROG Phone, Asus has even more ambitious things in mind for use with USB-C.\nHere\u2019s the back of Asus\u2019 AeroActiveCooler, which has an extra USB-C port and a headphone jack. Image : Asus Another shot of the AeroActive Cooler Image : Asus If you don\u2019t look close, you might think this is a Nintendo Switch, but it\u2019s not. Image : Asus Here\u2019s a better view of the ROG Phone\u2019s gamepad attachments. Image : Asus Advertisement You can skip ad after 1 second You can go to the next slide after 1 second Continue The ROG Phone\u2019s dock lets you use the phone like a desktop. Image : Asus This could be the future of home gaming setups. Image : Asus Look at all those ports Image : Asus The TwinView might be the ROG Phone\u2019s most interesting accessory, but also the hardest to get right. Image : Asus 1 / 8\nAdvertisement\nIn addition to Asus\u2019 WiGig Dock mentioned above, which features a boatload of ports and lets you turn the phone into a desktop of sorts similar to a Samsung Dex, Asus has created three more gaming add-ons for the ROG Phone.\nThe first is a cooling dock with a built-in fan that attaches to the bottom and back of the phone to help keep your hands dry and temps down even during the most intense mobile gaming sessions. Then there\u2019s a pair of gamepads that slip onto either side of the phone and turn the device into something like a mini Nintendo Switch. But the thing I want to try the most is Asus\u2019 TwinView Dock, which adds extra battery capacity and an entire second screen to the ROG Phone.\nAdvertisement\nI\u2019m not even sure what games or titles are supposed to take advantage of that second screen (and judging by its call to developers, I don\u2019t think Asus knows either), but it seems like Asus took a look at the most popular Nintendo handhelds of the last decade and said, \u201cWe can do that, too.\u201d\nSo despite not having an official price or release date (Asus says it\u2019s hoping for a release sometime in the third quarter of this year), the ROG Phone is exciting, ambitious, and the best example of why I\u2019ve been pumped about how gaming phones could change the mobile world as a whole. Asus, don\u2019t let me down."

            "Six accidents at school bus stops this week, which left five people dead, have shined a spotlight on distracted driving and bus stop safety. Getting to and from the bus might be more dangerous than the ride to school, CNN reports.\nAt Kenmore-Town of Tonawanda Union Free School District, all students from kindergarten through 4th grade are taught school bus safety procedures every year. The district says it does not come across drivers passing stopped buses often.\n\"We haven't had a real issue with it where it's been a huge safety concern,\" transportation supervisor Jim Nestico said.\nSometimes, drivers will attempt to pass school buses slowing down for pickups despite the flashing yellow lights.\n\"[They] try to scoot around us because they don't want to stop and get stuck behind us,\" Denise Lorenz Giordano explained. She's been a driver in the district for 19 years and now trains new drivers and helps oversee the safety program. \"Nobody likes getting stuck behind a school bus. I get it. But, there's little lives out there.\"\nTown of Tonawanda Police work closely with Ken-Ton UFSD to monitor bus routes and school buildings to be sure drivers are following all the rules around school buses.\n\"We all have to work together on this,\" Lt. Thomas Haynes said. \"Parents should be talking to their children. Looking for directions from the school bus driver before running out in to the street or approaching the school bus.\"\nHaynes recommends drivers, as always, take extra care around school buses.\nParents and kids are advised to wait for the bus far away from the road or the curb. Students should not approach the school bus until it is completely stopped and the driver tells them it is safe to do so. Students are also told to watch bus drivers to signal when it is safe to cross the road.\nHave a news tip, question or comment?"

            "B&H has a MacBook Air deal that is about as good (and cheap) as you can find for a new macOS computer.\nUntil the discount ends at midnight eastern on June 28th, you can snag a 13.3-inch MacBook Air with 128GB of storage for $799. A savings of $200 off its original price, your money will get you the latest model in the Air family since Apple has yet to unveil a refreshed version for 2018.\nThe MacBook Air lags behind what you\u2019ll find in the MacBook Pro in terms of its low-resolution screen, processor, and RAM speed, but there are some advantages to be had here. It\u2019s more affordable. Its keyboard likely won\u2019t send you to the Apple Store for repairs, as newer models with \u201cbutterfly\u201d key switches are evidently wont to do.\nBut what\u2019s even better is it will let you continue living your best life, also known as a dongle-free life. What extra power and panache the newer MacBook models may bring, they seriously lack in ports next to the Air\u2019s I/O offering that contains two USB Type-A ports, mini DisplayPort, MagSafe charging, and a full-size SD card slot."

            "Crime & Safety Boston Area Drug, Gun Bust: 29 People Arrested, Charged A former employee for City Councillor Michelle Wu was among those arrested. Reply\nBOSTON, MA \u2014 A city worker was among more than two dozen from the Boston and Brockton area arrested this week on drug and weapons charge, the US Attorney announced Thursday.\nGary Webster, 35, an ex-employee of Boston City Council President Michelle Wu who now works in the Planning and Development Agency, and Terrell Walker, 63, of Falmouth, who was involved in the 1973 killing of a Boston Police officer, were arrested along with 25 others. Two more wanted as a result of Operation Landshark and Operation Nor'easter, two federal investigations focusing on \"repeat offenders\" in the drug game, US Attorney Andrew Lelling said. \"The arrest of these individuals will hopefully mean noticeable improvements,\" Lelling said.\nAccording to his LinkedIn profile, Webster had worked for Wu for a little over four years. He is now on paid administrative leave from the Boston Planning and Development Agency, according to reports. Walker had served time for his involvement in the slaying of Boston Police Officer John Schroeder.\nThis investigation was brought about by the DOJ's \"Project Safe Neighborhood Initiative\" to reduce violent crime. The bust involved 150 federal, state, and local law enforcement agents from all over New England and the Department of Justice said they targeted repeat offenders who were the top 30 worst offenders of violence in the area. According to the press release at least nine residents of Brockton, a resident of Taunton, a South Boston resident, and several Boston residents were charged including:\nChad Benjamin, also known as \"Life\", 40 of South Boston, for distribution of 28 grams or more of cocaine base,\nJarrod Benjiamin, also known as \"J-Rock\", 37, of Brockton for distributing cocaine base,\nTequan Brown, also known as \"Pump\" 26 of Brockton for distributing fentanyl\nRashard Wilson, 36, of Brockton, for distribution of cocaine,\nGary Jamal Webster also known as Jamal, 35 of Boston, for conspiracy to distribute and process with intent to distribute cocaine and fentanyl,\nOrlando Waters, 30 of Boston, for distribution of cocaine base,\nDante Starks, also known as Tay, 36, of Mattapan for distribution of cocaine,\nTyrone Smith, also called Ty, 31, of Brockton for distribution of cocaine base,\nTavon Robinson, also called \"Smooth,\" 39, of Boston for conspiracy to distribute and distribution of heroin and fentanyl\nFranklin Perry, 52, of Dorchester for selling counterfeit notes,\nJeffrey Oliveira, 23, of Brockton for distribution of fentanyl,\nAbdul-Karin Muwakkil, also known as \"Tyrone Jones\" and \"Ty\" 37, of Dorchester for conspiracy to distribute and distribution of heroin and fentanyl\nDerek Moore, 46, of Roxbury, for being a felon in possession of a firearm,\nJorge Moneiro, also known as \"Jay,\" 23, of Brockton for distribution of fentanyl Those charged with federal drug distribution face up to 20 years in prison, at least three years of supervised release and a $1 million fine. If the defendant has a prior conviction for drug distribution, or a crime of violence, the maximum sentence is 30 years in prison with at least six years and up to a lifetime of supervised release and a $2 million fine. The arrests are part of two separate investigations, one called \"Operation Landshark\" and the other \"Operation Nor'Easter.\" Landshark investigated and targeted \"impact players\" and repeat offenders in Brockton and Boston, each who have prior convictions for acts of violence, firearm offenses or drug trafficking, according to a DOJ release. The DOJ said many of the people targeted in this operation are considered the top 30 criminal offenders responsible for violent acts and firearms in Brockton."

He is due to meet Home Secretary Sajid Javid today.\nBut the capital's violence was not just confined to Sunday night, with a man stabbed to death near a Tube station on Saturday night.\nThe 35-year-old victim has been named as Edmond Jonuzi - with the Albanian national was found fatally injured on Greens Lane near Turnpike Lane station, North London.\nSadiq Khan admits violent crime spiral is his responsibility\nWHAT'S BEING DONE? Mayor Saqid Khan has vowed to tackle the scourge of violence on London's streets - but how? MAYOR Sadiq Khan has vowed to tackle on the violent crime unfolding on London's streets.

Shocking statistics show how the police have lost control of large parts of the capital, with ultra-violent youths running riot. The easy availability of knives and acid, and the speed and manoeuvrability of scooters, has combined to see London gang warfare reach terrifying new levels. The most recent official figures recorded 19,385 moped crimes in just nine months - a rate of around sixty a day. This is a 1,000 per cent rise in just three years. As well as moped gang attacks, the capital has seen a sharp rise in the number of stabbings and shootings. Met Police statistics showed a five per cent rise in violent crime in the past year. The figures show 35 youth homicides in the last 12 months - up 25 per cent - a surge in the rate of muggings of 30 per cent, and an 18 per cent rise in knife crime offences. Since the turn of the year more than 60 people have been murdered on the streets of London - which has seen the capital overtake New York.\nA glut of cocaine flooding the country has been blamed for the country's violent crime.\nPolice have also turned to the public for help after four adults - including two women aged in their 70s - were targeted in a moped robbery on Friday, June 8.\nTwo masked men pounced on the group's stationary car in Croydon, threatening them with a large knife before snatching jewellery.\nA 30-year-old woman suffered a cut to her hand as one of the suspects tried to take her bracelet.\nPolice are now appealing for anyone who may have seen the robbery, asking anyone with information to call Croydon CID via 101 quoting reference 6135/8jun."

            "Massachusetts saw its first shark attack fatality in more than 80 years on Saturday when a male swimmer died in Cape Cod.\nIn a Facebook post shared Saturday afternoon, the Wellfleet Police Department announced that a male swimmer in his mid-20s \u201cwas bitten by what is believed to be a shark\u201d around 12 p.m. at Newcomb Hollow Beach.\n\u201cI was that guy on the beach screaming, \u2018Shark, shark!\u2019 It was like right out of that movie Jaws,\u201d Joe Booth, a local fisherman who was on the shore when the attack happened, told the Associated Press. \u201cThis has turned into Amity Island real quick out here.\u201d\nThe victim \u2014 whose identity is being withheld until his next of kin has been notified \u2014 \u201cwas pulled from the water\u201d and \u201cprovided emergency first aid,\u201d including CPR, authorities said.\nHe \u201cwas transported to Cape Cod Hospital by the Wellfleet Fire Department\u201d and later died at the hospital from injuries, Wellfleet police said.\nSources on the scene told CapeCod.com that the victim was surfing on his boogie board at the time of the attack. Unconscious with serious leg injuries, he was pulled from the water by his friend, the outlet reported.\nAccording to the AP, the beach has since been closed.\nRELATED VIDEO: Man Dead After a Shark Attack in Cape Cod, Police Say\nThough the summer season is over, and lifeguards were not on duty, \u201csunny skies and warm temperatures\u201d on Saturday attracted beachgoers, the AP reported.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been surfing all morning right here,\u201d Hayley Williamson, a Cape Cod resident and former lifeguard who was on the beach at the time, told the AP. \u201cThey were just further down.

            "CLEVELAND, Ohio \u2014 A California comedian is using social media attention over her unpleasant experience sharing an airplane with Republican former Ohio Gov. John Kasich to, ironically, raise money for Planned Parenthood in Ohio.\nKlausner wrote on Twitter that she began receiving random criticism and insults on social media on Wednesday after Fox News picked up her airplane story, which has been reported on by cleveland.com and other media outlets.\nShe responded by turning the tables on her conservative critics, saying she would donate $1 to Planned Parenthood of Ohio for each comment she received on Twitter and Instagram. She also launched a GoFundMe page, which she named \u201cTrolls for Planned Parenthood.\u201d\nI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t donate any money to women\u2019s reproductive freedom this morning, Susan! NOT! Thanks for the contribution. https://t.co/4GXXgv3B0P \u2014 Julie Klausner (@julieklausner) January 30, 2019\nKaisch is opposed to abortion, and has signed a number of laws restricting abortion access in Ohio (although shortly before leaving office in January, he vetoed a bill that would outlaw abortions when a fetal heartbeat is detected) while Klausner, a political liberal, says she supports women\u2019s right to choose to have an abortion.\nKlausner subsequently posted PayPal receipts showing donations she\u2019d sent to Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio.\nThanks to all of your mentions-- from trolls and supporters alike-- I've raised and donated just under 3K this morning for Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio. I'll continue to donate one dollar for each hateful tweet I get going forward. Thank you, and John Kasich sucks. pic.twitter.com/NxGqD1atrC \u2014 Julie Klausner (@julieklausner) January 30, 2019\nIn total, Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Sarah Inskeep said, the organization believes Klausner and her story have resulted in almost $5,000 being donated to Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, as of Wednesday afternoon. The organization is having a difficult time tracking the exact amount because some is going to the national Planned Parenthood organization while some has been sent to the Ohio affiliate, Inskeep said.\n\u201cThe active Go Fund Me page has been live only a few hours and is trending positively, raising thousands of dollars for our health centers,\u201d she said in an email.\nTo recap, Klausner first wrote of her interaction with Kasich on Jan. 16, when she posted on social media about Kasich getting her seat on an Alaska Airlines flight. As she told it, Kasich\u2019s seat had been taken by a co-pilot at the last minute, and rather than moving out of first class, Kasich took her seat. Klausner said she then agreed to take a different flight rather than prolong the confrontation.\nKasich has said through a spokesman that there was \u201cconfusion\u201d after the airline assigned a pilot to his seat, and that he\u2019s sorry that someone lost a seat.\nKlausner described the story in greater detail on Friday, using colorful and sometimes profane terms to describe Kasich\u2019s behavior, in her personal podcast. Cleveland.com summarized the Kasich story, as told on her podcast, in a story on Monday.\nSince that story published, it has been the second-most popular article on cleveland.com, as of Wednesday afternoon. Much of that traffic has been driven by shares on social media.\nRepublicans and Democrats alike seem to be enjoying the negative attention Kasich has received. Among those who have shared the story is Bob Paduchik, an Ohio political operative and Kasich critic who left a top position with the Republican National Committee in January to join President Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign."

            "LOS ANGELES \u2013 With the playoffs out of reach and the majority of the team\u2019s star players shut down for the rest of the 2018-19 campaign; the Los Angeles Lakers have been giving some players from the South Bay Lakers a platform to showcase their skills during the final stretch of the season.\nOne of those players is Jemerrio Jones, and he\u2019s not wasting his opportunity as he continues to make an impression in his short time in a Lakers uniform.\nOn Sunday, Jones got his first start with the team and went on to grab a career-high 16 rebounds which is the first time since the 1970-71 season, the first time the NBA started tracking starters, that a player for the Lakers has had that many rebounds in a first career start.\n\u201cI got the bubble guts a little bit, but I was straight with it,\u201d Jones said about learning he was starting against the Utah Jazz.\nAlong with the 16 rebounds, Jones had five points, five assists, two blocks, and a steal in 38 minutes on the floor. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope led all scorers with a game-high 32 points following by JaVale McGee with 22 and Alex Caruso with 18.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the dog in me,\u201d Jones on how he\u2019s grabbing so many rebounds. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do, and I\u2019m willing to do it, and you can see I don\u2019t score a lot of points. I got to do all the other little things.\u201d\nJones has now had back-to-back 10+ rebounds in two consecutive wins for the Lakers. The 23-year-old swiped 10 off the glass against the L.A. Clippers and 16 in the win over the Jazz along with seven in the game against the Golden State Warriors.\n\u201cI just got to take advantage of it,\u201d Jones said of his opportunity. \u201cIt was my time. I guess everything happen for a reason, so I\u2019m just going to take the chance and run with that.\u201d\nDuring Luke Walton\u2019s post-game press conference, the team\u2019s head coach said that Jones thanks him for the opportunity after every game he\u2019s played with the Lakers. Jones was asked about this in the locker room and when he\u2019ll stop thanking Walton for the opportunity.\n\u201cWhen they give me more than 10 days,\u201d Jones said referring to his contract.\nJones\u2019 response had a lot had the media and most of the players left in the locker room cracking up.\nNow Jones and company will try to continue their strong finish to an otherwise forgettable season as they\u2019re set to host Damian Lillard and the Portland Trail Blazers in the Lakers\u2019 season finale on Tuesday at the Staples Center."

            "Extreme Rules is over, and it brought us new champions, a few matches that were real good for different reasons, and then other matches that also happened during the event.\nWhile there was no Brock Lesnar, Ronda Rousey showed up despite her suspension as promised, and RAW commissioner Kurt Angle made sure to tell us that Brock has to show up on Monday or else be stripped of the Universal Championship.\nWe\u2019ve got all of Extreme Rules 2018 live blogged for you below: consider it your play-by-play, in-depth recap of the event. If you want to start from the beginning of the show, scroll down and work your way back up.\nSeth Rollins vs. Dolph Ziggler (c) in a 30-minute Iron Man match for the Intercontinental Championship\nAnd your main event: an Iron Man match between Intercontinental Champion Dolph Ziggler and the man who he took that title from, Seth Rollins. Rollins has been the best wrestler on RAW (and WWE\u2019s main roster) throughout 2018: the work he did, and Miz before him, is why the Intercontinental Championship can even credibly main event a pay-per-view right now.\nIn case you don\u2019t remember, Iron Man matches have a specific time frame: for this one in particular, it\u2019s 30 minutes. There can be as many falls \u2014 pins, submissions, count outs, disqualifications, whatever \u2014 in those 30 minutes as you can fit in. Whoever has the most wins when the clock runs out is the winner of the whole thing.\nDisqualifications are a fall here, so if Drew McIntyre, who came to the ring with Ziggler, interferes on Dolph\u2019s behalf, he has to do so without getting caught by the ref, or else Ziggler\u2019s record will take a hit.\nSeth is doing jumping jacks in the ring, and why shouldn\u2019t he brag about his energy? He did set a record for time spent wrestling on a single episode of RAW/in a gauntlet match earlier this year, and it was more than twice the time for this Iron Man match, even.\nRollins gets a rollup pin on a surprised Ziggler, and he\u2019s up 1-0 with around 25 minutes to go. Ziggler seems to have woken up thanks to that pin, but it\u2019s not enough \u2014 Rollins ends up getting in a stomp, and goes up 2-0.\nNow Drew McIntyre is beating Rollins down, which gives Seth a third fall and a commanding 3-0 lead, but McIntyre keeps beating on Seth, and Rollins might be ahead, but he\u2019s also unconscious with 20 minutes to go.\nZiggler picks up a pin to make it 3-1 while Rollins is still laying on the ground, which means McIntyre\u2019s attack was worth it: Rollins is still wobbly, and Ziggler had time to reset. There\u2019s a superkick and another pin, and now it\u2019s 3-2, Ziggler. McIntyre was banned from ringside, but the damage is already done.\nNow it\u2019s 3-3, which is good for two reasons: Seth now gets to wrestle from underneath like a face should for the remaining 17 minutes, while Dolph, who is a heel who for some reason still wrestles like a face too often, does not.\n4-3 Ziggler! McIntyre\u2019s beatdown of Rollins continues to pay off for Dolph. There\u2019s an extended rest hold now, but that\u2019s pretty acceptable 18 minutes into a match with 12 more to go, and the timing is right, too, since Rollins is trying to break the streak of Ziggler\u2019s four unanswered falls.\nWe\u2019ve got 10 minutes to go, and Rollins just hit a Blockbuster. The clock is back on the screen, and Seth is staring at it with a sense of urgency. He just misses getting counted out, which would have put Ziggler up 5-3. Rollins hits one of his old finishers \u2014 not the Pedigree, the knee strike \u2014 but it\u2019s not enough to even the score here. It\u2019s still 4-3, Dolph, with 7:30 to go on the clock.\nFrog Splash! Ziggler kicks out again. Seth is going to have to figure something out, because none of his usual tricks are working despite the fact we\u2019re approaching just six minutes left in the Iron Man match.\nA superplex into a Falcon Arrow, but Ziggler kicks out of this, too! Four minutes to go, and Rollins is still down 4-3.\nAnd it\u2019s tied! Rollins rolls up Ziggler to get things to 4-4, and the clock is ticking right past three minutes left. How many more falls are we going to be able to squeeze in here?\nYooo, Seth put Ziggler in a half crab, and then switched to a crossface, and he\u2019s just trying to get Ziggler to slowly leak all his HP while refusing to tap. Seth ends up missing a stomp, and Ziggler rolls out of the ring \u2014 there\u2019s one minute left, and things are all tied up, but Ziggler is feeling a little less well than he was a minute ago.\n30 seconds to go! Rollins counters a superkick with a kick to the head of his own, but he runs out of time on the clock before he can get the pin. Ziggler retains because of the draw, but don\u2019t worry, RAW commissioner Kurt Angle is here to say that shit ain\u2019t ending like this, and orders Ziggler back into the ring for sudden death overtime.\nAnd here\u2019s Drew McIntyre again! He attacks Rollins, giving Ziggler the chance to strike, pin, and retain.\nRusev vs. AJ Styles (c) for the WWE Championship\nIt\u2019s Rusev Day, but a victory here by Rusev could mean that it\u2019s truly Rusev Day. Styles is great and all, but this is Rusev: give Rusev the belt, and then every day will be even more of a Rusev Day than it was before.\nI want it, the crowd wants it, GIVE IT TO US, WWE, GIVE IT TO US NOW\nRusev is in control early, and he\u2019s targeting Styles\u2019 lower back, which will help with Rusev\u2019s finisher, the submission move the Accolade \u2014 it\u2019s a camel clutch, and if your back is already hurting, you don\u2019t stand a chance of escaping.\nStyles finally begins to take control, knocking Rusev outside the ring to the barricade, and then following it up with a Phenomenal Forearm. Rusev is back in the ring, avoiding a count out, and while Styles isn\u2019t in the danger he very recently was, his back is still a problem thanks to Rusev\u2019s earlier attacks. And hey, now we\u2019ve got dueling Rusev/Styles chants going!\nStyles went for a springboard 450, but Rusev avoided it, and nearly locked in the Accolade. Styles gets the Calf Crusher on Rusev on his third try \u2014 he\u2019s been working Rusev\u2019s leg like Rusev has been working Styles\u2019 back \u2014 but Rusev finally gets to the bottom rope and breaks up the submission before he has to tap.\nStyles is not thrilled about Rusev getting to the ropes, and is now going after Aiden English or helping Rusev reach them. The distraction by English works \u2014 it\u2019s one Styles definitely did not have to walk into, either \u2014 and Rusev ends up suplexing him on the outside.\nOohhhh man they got me there. That pin was like a 2.999999 count, but Styles kicked out. AND ANOTHER SUPER CLOSE COUNT, GOD\nRusev can\u2019t fully get the Accolade in, thanks to the damage done to his leg by Styles. He still caused pain to Styles, though, and now Aiden English ripped the top pad off the turnbuckle oh noooo Rusev is the one who went face-first into it.\nOH MAN Rusev kicked out after a springboard 450! MAYBE IT REALLY IS RUSEV DAY\nUgh, it is not. Styles lands a Phenomenal Forearm, and Rusev goes down for the 1-2-3. Styles retains, and today is just a regular Rusev Day.\nNia Jax vs. Alexa Bliss (c) for the RAW Women\u2019s Championship\nAlexa Bliss won the women\u2019s Money in the Bank briefcase last month, used it to end Ronda Rousey\u2019s bid at Nia Jax\u2019s RAW Women\u2019s Championship with a few swings that same night, and then cashed it in on Jax to become champ. Now, she\u2019s facing Jax in a rematch for that belt.\nBliss also pissed off Rousey in the process, both through hitting her with the briefcase and by taunting her the next night on RAW: Rousey then beat Alexa down so hard that she got suspended for 30 days.\nThat suspension is up Wednesday, but Ronda bought a ticket to Extreme Rules, and Alexa is defending against Nia in an Extreme Rules match... which means it\u2019s also legal for Rousey to interfere. This is going to be violent!\nNia Jax is beating the shit out of Alexa Bliss, and it is Good. Bliss might have Mickie James in her corner, but Nia has Natalya, who recently turned face and is pals with Rousey, so might be staying that way for a bit. Or, is going to turn on Rousey tonight in service of Bliss, one or the other.\nSPEAKING OF RONDA\nShe\u2019s beating Mickie James up, because Mickie was hitting Natalya, and Ronda was not about to let that continue. And now she starts chasing Bliss, but James recovers in time to hit Rousey with a kendo stick from behind a few times. And now Mickie is going after Nia with a steel chair! Ronda get up wyd start delivering justice with weapons.\nUgh, Bliss retains following the chair attacks, as Rousey couldn\u2019t get up fast enough \u2014 looks like we\u2019re moving full-speed into Rousey vs. Bliss as a feud, with poor Nia being left behind.\nBobby Lashley vs. Roman Reigns for the right to be booed harder by the audience\nListen, I like Roman Reigns, and hate the way WWE books him, and his whole thing is a poisoned well at this point \u2014 Ian Williams can tell you more. Putting him against Bobby Lashley is... interesting. It\u2019s like a different take on the Jinder Mahal match, where WWE is trying to see if they can make Roman\u2019s opponent so unlikable that he\u2019ll definitely get cheers. Except with Lashley, WWE probably also thinks he\u2019s potentially likable, as they\u2019re writing his awful segments and promos, anyway, so... maybe this one is about seeing if they can get Lashley cheered by facing Roman, who will not be cheered? What a puzzler.\nAnyway this is basically a pissing contest happening inside a ring because Brock Lesnar isn\u2019t around to defend the Universal Championship. The good news is that it\u2019s not happening as the main event, so it\u2019s good that those rumors didn\u2019t come to fruition.\nThe crowd is chanting, and it is not for the match. It would help a lot if Bobby Lashley had a personality since his return other than, \u201cno, I did serve in the military\u201d and \u201cactually, I do love my sisters.\u201d\nThis match isn\u2019t bad, by the way: it just kind of is. It\u2019s very WWE-style power guy vs. power guy, moving slow, utilizing rest holds and big forearms in equal measure. You only want me typing that so many times, I\u2019m guessing, so.\nThe good news is that they\u2019re starting to up the ante, power-wise, so bigger moves are being hit. And hey, the crowd is split about 50/50 for Roman, which isn\u2019t necessarily support for Lashley, but at least it sounds like it is through the broadcast.\nThe crowd remember that Lashley\u2019s finisher, in 2018, is a stalling vertical suplex, and suddenly, the Reigns cheers are louder.\nWell then! Reigns went for a spear, and Lashley countered with one of his own, and then pinned Reigns. It looks like my prediction from early April is real close to coming true:\nBrock is going to break Punk's modern-day WWE world title record for reign length, lose to Lashley at SummerSlam, then go back to UFC when his suspension is up. \u2014 Marc Normandin (@Marc_Normandin) April 9, 2018\nListen, I didn\u2019t want to bring it into the world, but not tweeting it wasn\u2019t going to stop it, either.\nTeam Hell No (Daniel Bryan and Kane) vs. the Bludgeon Brothers (c) for the SmackDown Tag Team Championship\nDaniel Bryan and Kane took a beating from the Bludgeon Brothers backstage earlier during this event, so it\u2019s unclear if Team Hell No is going to be prepared for this championship fight. We\u2019ll have to wait and see after the entrances and this promo video.\nDaniel Bryan is here, clutching his ribs but yessing away all the same. The Bludgies are coming out next, which means no Kane, maybe? Does this mean Bryan has to try to fight them alone, or that Kane is going to enter late and make the save for Bryan? Or enter late and turn on Bryan? So many possibilities!\nBryan\u2019s alone here \u2014 no Kane to start, at least. The good news is that if Daniel Bryan wins this by himself, he can yell \u201cI\u2019m the tag team champions!\u201dand have it be both technically and grammatically accurate.\nDB did a solid job of fending off Harper and Rowan, but the damned numbers game eventually got to him, and now he\u2019s taking a beating from the two as they tag in and out, with nowhere for Bryan to escape.\nBryan, as he does, found a way! He moved out of the way of a Harper suicide dive to the outside, so Harper hit his own teammate with it. And here\u2019s Kane! In a walking boot! The Demon\u2019s Walking Boot, probably, but a walking boot.\nAnd Bryan gets to him for a tag! Kane does damage standing in place \u2014 he\u2019s very practiced at that, given he\u2019s had awful knees forever now \u2014 and lays out the Bludgies.\nIt\u2019s not enough, though, as Bryan gets beat down again upon his return to the ring, and the Bludgeon Brothers retain after hitting their finisher. Now we wait and see if Kane and Bryan can still be buds, or if they\u2019re in a difficult emotional place following a loss.\nBraun Strowman vs. Kevin Owens in a steel cage match\nFinally, a match with moderately more extreme rules. Braun Strowman has Kevin Owens where he can\u2019t run away: inside a steel cage. This match will work perfectly for me if Braun never tries to escape the cage, and instead just focuses on keeping Owens from escaping, i.e., attempts to end Kevin Owens.\nilu KO but it\u2019s Braun, I\u2019m not about to tell him to do or not do anything.\nKevin Owens tries to escape, repeatedly, and then realizes he\u2019s probably going to have to fight just a little bit. He laid into Strowman a bit, attempted a pin, aaaaaaand was immediately thrown off. Go back to trying to escape, Kev.\nWell, assuming he still knows he\u2019s even in a place he needs to escape, as Braun is throwing him around the walls again and again, to the crowd\u2019s delight \u2014 they\u2019re chanting \u201cone more time\u201d after each one.\nOwens handcuffed Braun to the top rope! Now he\u2019s trying to escape following a \u201csuck it\u201d crotch chop. oh god strowman broke the handcuffs and caught Owens before he left the cage.\nOh Braun, great visual, but you lost the match now. Not that it matters, because Owens just lost the goddamn war: Braun chokeslammed Owens off of the top of the cage through the announce table far below, and since Owens technically had his feet hit the ground first, he wins. It, uh, was probably not worth it for Kevin.\nCHOKESLAM FROM THE TOP OF THE CAGE! pic.twitter.com/scH8WVl2Hg \u2014 SB Nation (@SBNation) July 16, 2018\nThe thing about this is that normally, the heel would claim they won despite how they won, and rub said victory in their opponent\u2019s face, eventually forcing another match. Owens is probably just going to quietly accept his W and hope Braun forgets he exists for his own safety. Good twist on a classic tale, and hey, Braun never tried to escape the cage: he just wanted Owens to get what Strowman felt he deserved, and he sure did.\nShinsuke Nakamura vs. Jeff Hardy (c) for the United States Championship\nNakamura, fresh off of his dick-punch-filled feud with AJ Styles for the WWE Championship, has downgraded a bit and set his sights on Jeff Hardy and the United States Championship. Jeff Hardy is back to wearing creepy face paint, so this feud is good, actually.\nahahaha Shinsuke uppercutted Hardy right in the willows before the bell rang, and then once the match began, hit him in the face with the Kinshasa: Nakamura gets the pin, and he\u2019s the new United States champ!\nThere have been all kinds of reports of Jeff Hardy being hurt and wrestling through it, so if you were looking for confirmation of just how hurt, the low-blow-plus-finisher match is probably what you were looking for.\nAnd here comes Randy Orton, fresh off a haircut, staring down Nak. And apparently he\u2019s returned as heel Randy Orton, as he kicked Hardy in the dick for good measure and then sauntered off.\nAsuka vs. Carmella for the SmackDown Women\u2019s Championship\nIt\u2019s the rematch we\u2019ve all been waiting for, and hopefully the one where Asuka destroys James Ellsworth\u2019s corporeal form. He\u2019ll be suspended above the ring in a shark cage, so it won\u2019t happen immediately, but maybe after he tries to interfere somehow, his time on this plane will come to an end.\nIt took like, five seconds for James Ellsworth to drop a weapon down from the cage \u2014 he\u2019s wearing a bulky outfit, and it\u2019s definitely full of weapons. Asuka saw it before any damage could be done, though: it\u2019s important to note that this match is not under extreme rules, either, so Carmella can\u2019t legally use any of these weapons.\nWeapon number two dropped the cage also did not work out for Carmella.\nEllsworth got free from the cage, and is now inadvertently acting as a distraction, as he got caught on the cage and Asuka is kicking the shit out of him while Carmella lays outside the ring.\nEveryone is trying to stop Asuka from kicking Ellsworth into oblivion, but they\u2019re failing. The problem is that Carmella is awake again, and just threw Asuka face-first into the cage. A pin already? Jesus, guys, I know you need to find ways to get Carmella to top the most frightening wrestler in the women\u2019s division/possibly your entire company, but come on.\nAlso:\nWe're three matches in to Extreme Rules and none of the match stipulations have been extreme, to the point that using a weapon in the current match will cause a DQ. \u2014 Marc Normandin (@Marc_Normandin) July 15, 2018\nWe\u2019re saving up all of the extremeitude for later, I guess.\nOne more Asuka thing: I\u2019m all for Asuka losing matches where the goal is we want to see Carmella get her comeuppance at the hands of Asuka. But this is more like WWE making Asuka look like an ineffectual dork, and that\u2019s not helpful for Asuka nor Carmella!\nFinn Balor vs. The Constable, Baron Corbin\nWe\u2019re getting Balor vs. literal cop Baron Corbin, who has shaved his head and looks significantly better, but also is now more cop-like.\nCorbin is controlling this match, because even though Balor is super fast and agile, Corbin is stupid-fast and agile for someone who is 6-foot-8, and also, he\u2019s 6-foot-8 and strong. Balor is starting to fight back from underneath, but building momentum has been tough against Stephanie McMahon\u2019s personal cop.\nBalor tried to go for a top rope move while Corbin was on the ground, but Corbin got up, grabbed Balor by the throat, and chokeslammed him into a backbreaker. Things are not going well for Finn.\nEverything Balor tries is countered or responded to with extreme prejudice, but he finally snuck in a counter pin when Corbin went for his finisher. Balor gets the 1-2-3 and the surprise victory over Corbin.\nKurt Angle gave Brock Lesnar an ultimatum\nRAW commissioner Kurt Angle just said absentee champion Brock Lesnar needs to show up on Monday\u2019s episode of RAW to talk conditions for defending his title, or else he\u2019ll be stripped of it. My first thought is that this gives Braun Strowman a chance to cash Money in the Bank on him. My second thought is Lesnar refuses to show up and continues to hold the title and call himself the champ whether he\u2019s stripped of it or not.\nWoken Matt Hardy and Bray Wyatt (c) vs. The B Team for the RAW Tag Team Championships\nHuh, this is a surprising opener for Extreme Rules, especially considering WWE has been trying to kick off pay-per-views with some intense matches whose energy will (in theory) carry through the show. Maybe we\u2019re about to see Bo Dallas and Curtis Axel surprise everyone in the arena by getting a lengthy, energetic championship bout against Hardy and Bray.\nIt\u2019s not that this foursome is incapable: it would just be surprising! But a welcome surprise, for sure.\nOh look, there\u2019s Ronda Rousey at ringside, waving the ticket she had to buy around, I wonder if she\u2019ll interfere later on ha ha probably not that never happens. ...Okay I promise I\u2019m not making fun I want Ronda to snap Alexa\u2019s arm off at the elbow later on, this is just a thing you knew was going to happen given her suspension by RAW commissioner Kurt Angle.\nHere we go!\nI\u2019m really excited for Bo Dallas vs. Bray Wyatt, not gonna lie. The real-life brothers are not storyline brothers, but you can definitely tell they\u2019re related when you look at them next to each other. Aw, Bo tagged out after Bray was tagged in so they wouldn\u2019t give the crowd the brother-on-brother violence we all crave.\nWhile this match is slowly getting going, let me just take a second to say fuck Hulk Hogan being reinstated by WWE earlier today. I\u2019m also disappointed in everyone who wrestles for WWE tweeting support for him, but also it\u2019s hard to know if they\u2019re being forced to by their boss.\nAlright, we have a pin attempt by Bo Dallas on Hardy, and Curtis Axel follows up with one of his own on Hardy after being tagged in. This match isn\u2019t very extreme so far, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s only at Extreme Rules, not under extreme rules.\nBo Dallas threw Matt Hardy into Bray Wyatt while they were about to use their tandem finisher, and Wyatt flew out of the ring! Bo pinned Hardy, and The B Team are now the RAW Tag Team champs!\nThat match was about as long as it needed to be, and given the ending, we\u2019ll probably see a rematch that splits Hardy and Bray a little further apart.\nAlright this match was worth it for Curtis Axel to explain how winning the titles made him feel: \u201cHow does it feel? How does a rainbow feel?!\u201d"

I don't know,\" one caller said. \"I don't think he would hurt Emma either, but, you know.\"\nAnother caller reported seeing Kennedy on the side of Greensboro Road changing a tire.\nDeputy Jimmy Barns is credited with saving Emma.\n\"(He) entered the mobile home and grabbed her up and shielded her with great care and she had a great smile on her face,\" Graves said.\nNO TITLE PROVIDED\nBarns said it is a relief knowing the child is safe.\n\"That's the best feeling in the world to protect someone and know they are safe,\" he said.\nPolice issued an Amber Alert early Monday for Emma, last seen with Kennedy, saying she was believed to be in \"extreme danger.\"\nNO TITLE PROVIDED\nGraves said he believes Emma and Kennedy had been in the area for some time.\n\"We feel like he has probably been here since he came back from Virginia, he has been in Randolph County,\" Graves said.\nOn Tuesday, Emma's family said they are happy to have her back \"healthy and safe.\"\nNO TITLE PROVIDED\n\"We thank all of the friends, viewers, media, police & authorities who have supported us during this time and made it possible for us to locate Emma. Everyone who helped in every little way are heroes today, you brought Emma home,\" the family said in a statement.\nKristen Murphy, Emma's mom, said she broke off her three-year relationship with Kennedy in March after he was arrested on drug charges. According to Murphy, Kennedy said he was out of jail and asked to meet her at the gas station on Sunday.\n\"In hopes of him leaving me alone, I went to go meet him,\" she said.\nNO TITLE PROVIDED\nMurphy said Kennedy tried to get into her car, hitting her and attempting to stab her, before he took off with Emma. Murphy says, with his criminal history, she believes Emma's life is in danger.\n\"He has nothing left to lose now,\" she said. \"I feel like he would hurt Emma. He is just gonna either disappear or I'm never gonna see her again, because he's gonna harm her. I think he is that sick.\"\nAccording to the N.C. Bureau of Investigation, Kennedy, who once had an Asheboro, North Carolina address, is a registered sex offender."

            "Last week, we accepted the news that Kylie Jenner will knock Mark Zuckerberg from the top seat to become the youngest ever self-made billionaire. This despite the fact that the \"self-made\" title is a stretch for a woman who wouldn't be anywhere without her family's fame.\nThis week, we accept the news that Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, just became the richest man in modern history. Champagne all around.\nBloomberg reports that Bezos' net worth briefly broke the $150 billion mark Monday, right on the eve of Amazon Prime Day. No single human has been that rich since 1982, when Forbes started tracking rich people's wealth. Bill Gates came close during the dot com boom in the late '90s, but his wealth peaked at a mere $100 billion\u2014that's about $149 billion now, with inflation.\nBy the end of the day, Forbes reports that Bezos' wealth dipped back down to $149.7 billion when Amazon's shares fell. Still, Bezos is worth about $56 billion more than Gates.\nMuch of Bezos' wealth comes from Amazon, which is why it fluctuates when Amazon's market shares fluctuate; he owns 16 percent of the company. He spends a lot of money on Blue Origin, which competes directly with SpaceX in space travel. He also owns The Washington Post. Nice work if you can get it.\nBezos is less generous with his billions than Gates and Gates' foundation. However, he funded scholarships for DACA students this year, and he tweeted in April that he's planning to do more philanthropic work. Hey, that's a start, right?"

            "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The City by the Bay could make history by electing its first African-American woman, Asian-American woman or openly gay man for mayor in a contest added to Tuesday's ballot after the unexpected death of Mayor Ed Lee in December.\nThe leading candidates are London Breed, the African-American president of the Board of Supervisors who briefly served as interim mayor after Lee's death; Jane Kim, a San Francisco supervisor and daughter of Korean immigrants; and former state Sen. Mark Leno, who entered the mayor's race long before Lee's death, and who championed gay marriage statewide.\nIt is the city's first competitive mayoral race in 15 years, and one without an incumbent.\nAll three are Democrats, but Breed is backed by the establishment business community while Leno and Kim are favored by more liberal elements of the Democratic Party, including tenants and critics of tech companies such as Airbnb and Uber.\nThe city has enormous wealth thanks to a flourishing economy led by the tech industry, but it's also plagued by rampant homelessness and deep pockets of poverty.\nA fourth candidate, Angela Alioto, served as a supervisor in the late 1980s and 1990s and her father, Joe, was mayor from 1968 to 1976.\nSan Francisco uses a ranked-choice voting system. Voters rank their top-three candidates in order of preference. The candidates with the least votes are eliminated in rounds until there's a winner.\nHow Ranked-Choice Voting Works Roque Ruiz\nJohn Artnz, the director of the Department of Elections in San Francisco, says a winner might not be known until Friday, which is also the state deadline for counties to receive ballots postmarked by June 5.\n\"If it's very, very, very tight it might come down to every single ballot card,\" Artnz said.\nIn 2010, Jean Quan became the mayor of nearby Oakland when she scored enough second- and third-place votes to beat the candidate with the most first-place votes.\nIn this race, Kim and Leno are deploying a similar tactic and have asked supporters to vote for the other as their No. 2 choice on the ballot.\nThe other candidates are Michelle Bravo, a massage therapist; Amy Farah Weiss, a homelessness activist; Republican businessman Richie Greenberg; and Ellen Lee Zhou, a public health worker who opposed recreational marijuana legalization."

There is grieving,\" Welch said.\nMaddox's parents have been notified of the discovery by law enforcement.\nDuring a news conference on Wednesday, Ian Ritch said that Maddox initially took off a little ways ahead, maybe \"25 to 30 feet\" before he went into a \"major sprint.\"\n\"I started worrying once I could not see him anyone,\" Ritch said.\nNO TITLE PROVIDED\nRitch said he felt guilty for letting his son get so far ahead of him, but said Maddox loves to run.\n\"It's torture. I just want my little boy back home. I want to give him a big hug as soon as I see him,\" Ritch said.\nRitch, who has diabetes, said he has some trouble running but took off after his son.\n\"He looked back at me and laughed like he normally does ... he slowed down a little then he paced himself back up,\" he said.\nCarrie Ritch, Maddox's mother, gave a brief statement during a news conference on Tuesday.\n\"Maddox is my whole world and my reason for living,\" Carrie Ritch said. \"His smile is so contagious, and his laughter is so precious.\"\nNO TITLE PROVIDED\nAuthorities said everyone in Maddox's family was cooperating with the investigation, but that a lot of unanswered questions remain.\n\"It is too early to suspect foul play,\" FBI Supervisor Jason Kaplan said.\nKaplan said they still want to know where Maddox entered the water, but he would not say if there was trauma to his body, or if he was wearing the clothes he was last seen in.\nMaddox was autistic and nonverbal, which made the search for him even more difficult, authorities said.\nThe FBI is offering a $10,000 reward for information in his disappearance.\nAuthorities are urging anyone who was at the park to call 704-869-1075."

            "IPL 2019 | I\u2019ll be First One to Hang My Boots When Time Comes: Yuvraj\nAt 37 years of age, very few people expected Yuvraj Singh to draw the interest of teams at the IPL-12 auctions before Mumbai Indians gave him a much-needed lifeline by bringing him on board for INR 1 crore. The faith that Mumbai showed in the swashbuckling Punjab batsman was partially redeemed when the veteran blazed a 35-balls 53 in their opening IPL-12 tie against Delhi Capitals.\nAlthough Yuvraj\u2019s knock failed to lift his side to a win, his debut performance for Mumbai Indians showed that the fire to perform still burns bright.\n\u201cThe last two years, have been up and down (for me). And I could not decide on what to do,\u201d Yuvraj, who was the top-scorer in Mumbai\u2019s 37-run loss, told the media on Sunday night.\n\u201cI have been speaking to Sachin (Tendulkar) as well and he has gone through that time when he was 37-38-39 (and how he felt). Talking to him makes things easier for me. And I am just playing because I enjoy playing cricket pretty much,\u201d he added.\nYuvraj was released by the Kings XI Punjab last year after scoring just 65 runs in six innings in 2018. This was also his first IPL fifty since scoring 70 not out against the Delhi franchise in the 2017 season.\nThe Punjab southpaw is not prepared to take a call on his cricketing career yet. \u201cWhen the time comes, I will be the first one to hang my boots,\u201d the 37-year-old said.\n\u201cThe main thing for me was why I played the game when I started off. I played the game because I enjoyed playing cricket. When I enjoyed playing cricket, I was not playing for India. I was playing for U-14s and U-16s. So till the time, I enjoy playing cricket, I am going to play,\u201d he added.\nMumbai is Yuvraj\u2019s sixth IPL team after Kings XI Punjab, Pune Warriors, Royal Challengers Bangalore, Delhi Daredevils and Sunrisers Hyderabad. He was pleased to start the new journey with a fifty under her belt.\n\u201cI decided to take my time out there, wickets were falling around me. If I took a chance early we were going to end up wrapping up early. I am happy with the way I was hitting the ball. The most important is winning the game, we\u2019ll learn from the mistakes,\u201d Yuvraj said about his knock on Sunday.\nYuvraj, who has played in 129 IPL games so far for 2705 runs with 13 fifties and strike-rate of 130, was pleased to bat at the crucial No. 4 position for MI.\n\u201cI have been batting No. 4 in last 6-7 years of my career. I have been playing for a long time, so they (MI) know what responsibility to give me. It went well today, hopefully runs will look good if I can win the game for the team,\u201d he said.\nThe MI batsman felt that it was a \u2018180-190\u2019 track at Wankhede and Delhi Capitals\u2019 213 was a match-winning total.\n\u201cLosing Rohit (Sharma) early and the way (Quinton) De Kock was going but got out and then Pollard also was dismissed early, we couldn\u2019t get any partnerships going. It was a 180-190 sort of a wicket. 213 was a match-winning score, Delhi has got a good bowling attack,\u201d he said.\nYuvraj was also full of praise for fellow southpaw Rishabh Pant, who blazed 78 off just 27 balls with seven sixes and seven fours.\n\u201cI can\u2019t comment on (World Cup) selection but Rishabh was outstanding. He had an outstanding season last year as well. He has been playing well in the Test matches, scored two hundreds overseas which shows his talent. It\u2019s important that we groom him well, hopefully he\u2019ll be next big thing for us,\u201d he said about Pant.\nFinally on the young Jammu & Kashmir paceman Rasikh Salam, who made his debut for MI on Sunday at the age of just 17, Yuvraj said, \u201cRasikh the day he came in the nets, everybody was really impressed by him, the way he swung the ball. The confidence that he showed, that\u2019s the reason why guys decided to play him. He swings the ball and got hit for 6 and 4 in the last two balls but apart from that if you see he bowled really well for his first game. He is going to be really special in the next 2-3 years.\u201d"

            "Waking up this morning, you probably thought there was no way that the missed pass interference call in the \u200bNFC Championship\u200b could be any worse. Well, surprise! Thanks to a fan that posted this new angle to his Twitter account , we can see not only the definition of pass interference and helmet-to-helmet contact, but also what very well could've been a touchdown had the Saints Tommylee Lewis not been interfered with.\nI\u2019ll take that L but come on @NFL y\u2019all got some explaining to do, this game was to big to miss such an obvious call with not 1 but 2 refs standing right there! Smh WHO DAT for life. By the way @RamsNFL you definitely can\u2019t say the crowd didn\u2019t make a difference! @Saints pic.twitter.com/SOUWK2bp5p \u2014 Richie Scheuermann (@Rscheuermann2) January 21, 2019\n\u200b\u200b This will without a doubt be a tough one for New Orleans to swallow, no matter which angle you're looking at.\nEven Los Angeles Rams defensive back Nickell Robey-Coleman admitted it was pass interference in the postgame scrum, and while Saints head coach Sean Payton did receive an apologetic call after the game from head of officials Albert Riveron, it doesn't put the ball in the Saints possession, half the distance from the goal, with under two minutes left.\nLove this angle\u2026both looking right at it\u2026total failure by both of them pic.twitter.com/HAtnzxAmHp \u2014 Busted Coverage (@bustedcoverage) January 21, 2019"

            "Josh Gordon is no longer a member of the Cleveland Browns. The NFL franchise announced this evening that it was parting ways with the troubled-but-talented wide receiver.\nThe Browns' general manager, John Dorsey, announced the decision in a statement:\n\"For the past six years, the Browns have fully supported and invested in Josh, both personally and professionally and wanted the best for him, but unfortunately we\u2019ve reached a point where we feel it\u2019s best to part ways and move forward. We wish Josh well,\" he said.\nGordon, 27, is undoubtedly one of the most-gifted wide receivers in the NFL, but he's struggled with off-the-field issues over the years. The former second-round pick had been a member of the Browns since 2012. NFL insider Ian Rapoport has more on the Browns' decision to release Gordon. He says it's an \"overall trust issue.\" \"He was late today to the facility, source said. In addition, he was fine at Friday\u2019s practice, then injured his hamstring. The question of how is part of the reason they released him. My understanding is it\u2019s an overall trust issue for a player on thin ice,\" Rapoport tweeted.\nNFL insider Benjamin Allbright also weighed in with the following details about Gordon:\n\"To my knowledge there was no new failed test from Josh Gordon, though I'm making some calls now. He was late to report this morning,\" he tweeted.\nGordon, an All-Pro wide receiver in 2013, had one catch for 17 yards so far this season. He has more than 3,100 career yards and 16 touchdowns."

            "SOME forms of cannabis oil are available to buy for medical purposes in British pharmacies \u2014 but there are various legal and health arguments surrounding its use and benefits.\nThe oil has been claimed to be beneficial for treating a number of ailments and is at the centre of high-profile legal rows in Britain. Here's the lowdown on it...\n2 Cannabis oil is thought to help a number of ailments Credit: EPA\nIs cannabis oil legal in the UK?\nCannabis oil is a substance extracted from the cannabis plant by steam distillation.\nA low-concentrate version of the oil is available to buy in the UK and is not illegal \u2014 but products are required to contain less than 0.05 per cent THC.\nTHC (tetrahydrocannabinol) is the psychoactive component in cannabis that makes users feel \"high\".\nCannabis oil is usually consumed orally, and has a very distinct taste.\nThere have been high profile calls for higher concentration oil to be made legal.\nThe family of epilepsy sufferer Billy Caldwell, 12, were granted an exemption by the Home Secretary Sajid Javid to take concentrated CBD cannabis oil after insisting it was a lifeline. And Alfie Dingley's parents say the six-year-old should be allowed the same treatment after describing its impact on his seizures as \"nothing short of a miracle\".\n2 Legal low-concentrate oil is sold in high street stores throughout the UK Credit: Alamy\nToday it was announced by the Home Secretary that medicinal cannabis will be available on prescription from next month.\nDoctors will be able to prescribe cannabis products to patients from November 1.\nThe new rules apply to England, Wales and Scotland, Sajid Javid said in a written statement.\nIt follows several high-profile cases, including young epilepsy sufferers Alfie Dingley and Billy Caldwell, whose conditions appeared to be helped by cannabis oil.\nIn order for a cannabis product to be considered medicinal it must meet three requirements: it \"needs to be a preparation or product which contains cannabis, cannabis resin, cannabinol or a cannabinol derivative; it is produced for medicinal use in humans and; is a medicinal product, or a substance or preparation for use as an ingredient of, or in the production of an ingredient of, a medicinal product\", according to Mr Javid's statement.\nHow is higher concentrated cannabis oil different from normal CBD oil?\nOne type of oil is CBD (cannabidiol) which has been promoted as a possible treatment method for those living with addiction or anxiety.\nHowever CBD products - while legal - have not been approved for use in the United States.\nIt is also claimed that there are possible side effects including irritability and nausea.\nLow concentrate CBD cannabis oil has less than 0.05 per cent of the psychoactive substance THC.\nHowever higher concentrated cannabis oil contains a higher level of THC - the component in cannabis that makes users feel \"high\"."

            "KISSIMMEE, Fla. \u2014 The wife of an Iraq War veteran wiped away tears and held her young daughters as she said goodbye to her family at Orlando International Airport on Friday morning \u2014 not knowing the next time they would all be together.\nAlejandra Juarez, who entered the United States illegally from Mexico more than 20 years ago, had pleaded publicly for President Donald Trump to stop her deportation. But a letter delivered to the White House this week by members of Congress wasn't enough to keep her with her husband, a naturalized American citizen, and their two American-born daughters.\n\"My mom is a good person and she's not a criminal,\" daughter Pamela, 16, told the media as she sobbed and covered her face.\nRep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., who was at the airport, said he told Juarez, 39, that he was sorry that she had to be deported under Trump' s \"zero tolerance\" immigration policy.\n\"We'll still be pursuing our request to the administration for her case, and we are not giving up despite this anti-immigration rhetoric,\" Soto told NBC News.\nJuarez was flying back to Mexico alone, although her youngest daughter, Estela, 9, would later be joining her, said the family's attorney, Chelsea Nowel.\n\"She is on her way to Mexico where she has no support system and knows essentially no one,\" Nowel said in a text message.\nJuarez had been living in Davenport, Florida, with her husband, Cuauhtemoc, also known as Temo, and their two daughters. Temo, who describes himself as a conservative who voted for Trump, had written his own letter to the president asking for a reprieve for his wife, reported Stars and Stripes.\nJuarez said she was escaping violence in her home country when she crossed into the United States illegally. Three years later she met and married Temo in Florida.\n\u201cI came here illegally. I\u2019m ashamed of it. I know I did something wrong,\u201d Juarez told NBC News in an interview before she was deported. \u201cI seriously thought that was the only exit out of a situation I was living in. I think that saved my life.\u201d\nTemo served in the U.S. Marine Corps and later joined the Army National Guard in Florida. He came to the U.S. from Mexico as a child and was naturalized days before he was deployed to Iraq. The couple has two daughters, ages 9 and 16, both born in the United States.\nThe office of Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., which represents the family's congressional district, earlier confirmed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement had taken Juarez's passport \u2014 foreshadowing her likely deportation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s common for ICE to take the passport to ensure the person has a valid travel document,\u201d Nowel said at the time.\n\u201cIt added an unnecessary amount of stress on Alejandra on what was already one of the worst days of her life,\u201d she added.\nSoto sent bipartisan letters on Wednesday addressed to Trump, the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security requesting a stay of removal.\nThere is an immigration policy for members of the military and their families called \u201cparole in place\u201d to \u201crecognize the important sacrifices made by U.S. Armed forces members, veterans, enlistees, and their families.\" The Citizen and Immigration Services website says they provide \u201cdiscretionary options such as parole in place or deferred action on a case-by-case basis.\u201d\nThe Juarezes received a call Tuesday from their attorney saying ICE agreed to review her most recent \u201cparole in place\u201d application. But they have rejected her previous three applications, according to Stars and Stripes.\n\u201cI love this country. This country has given me great things because we have worked hard. But the America we are living in now is getting full of hate,\u201d Juarez said.\nShe checked in regularly with immigration authorities during former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, and says she was always told she is not a criminal and has nothing to worry about.\nNow, under Trump\u2019s immigration policy, few exceptions are made for unauthorized immigrants \u2014 even in cases when a crime has not been committed.\n\u201cBefore you enlist in the military, think it twice. Before you marry an immigrant, think it twice. Think if it\u2019s really worth it for you to serve this country, because look how they treated me,\u201d Juarez previously told NBC News, through tears.\nShe had said that if she were deported Friday, she would take daughter Estela with her to Mexico while her her other daughter, Pamela, stays with her father in Florida.\n\u201cIt makes me sad, mainly because I tell my mom everything. And she always supports me \u2026 And now that I\u2019m getting older I\u2019m going to have more problems and issues that I\u2019m going to need help with and I want my mom to be there with me,\" Pamela said.\nThe parents decided to take the younger daughter to Mexico because Temo travels for work and she is too young to take care of herself.\n\"I don\u2019t really want to go to Mexico but I know I need to because I\u2019m too young and also I want to go for my mom \u2026 because I don\u2019t want her to be lonely,\u201d Estela said.\nShe went on to say what she would tell Trump if gotten the chance: \u201cI know my mom made a mistake and it was wrong, but he said he was going to deport criminals. My mom is not a criminal,\" the girl said. \"She is a military spouse and a mom of two kids.\u201d\nReporting by Carmen Sesin in Miami, Anthony Terrell in Tampa and Kissimmee and Erik Ortiz in New York; video by Jesse North.\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM."

The furry pets jumped through hoops, rolled cylinders with their paws, and jumped over one another\u2019s backs as the judges looked on in amazement.\nOne cat made its way across a barre pole upside down while another shimmied using only its front legs to hold on.\nA very talented black cat at first refused to participate in one of the act\u2019s final tricks. \u201cNope, doesn\u2019t want to do it,\u201d judge Mel B laughed.\nHost Tyra Banks added: \u201cCats are like, \u2018When I feel like it.\u2019\u201d But with a little encouragement (including a standing ovation from the audience), the feline pulled it off.\nThen, another subbed in to climb a wooden pole feet into the air and daringly jump off once he reached the top, boldly landing on a pillow below.\nThe audition obviously made its mark. The cats moved on to the next round and are in the running to win $1 million and a Vegas headlining gig.\nAmerica\u2019s Got Talent airs on NBC Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET."

More info\nThe first celebration, Eid al-Fitr, began on Thursday, June 14 this year, the date determined by the Islamic calendar. The date of Eid al-Adha, said to be the holier of the two Eids, is also dependant on the lunar calendar each year. Eid al-Adha falls on the tenth day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the 12th and final month in the Islamic calendar. In the international solar Gregorian calendar, the dates drift about 11 days earlier each year.\nThe dates of the upcoming Eid al-Adha are determined by the moon sighting, applied on the 29th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar. However, the sighting of the new moon will vary between countries, so the exact date depends on local religious authorities. In Saudi Arabia, the date of Eid al-Adha determines the date of Hajj. This year, local news has reported that the crescent was sighted, making Sunday, August 12 the first day of the 12th month and August 21 the first day of Eid al-Adha.\nEid 2018: Hajj is an annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia\nWhat is Hajj? Hajj is an annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, the holiest city for Muslims. It is a mandatory religious duty for Muslims, that must be carried out one in their lifetimes by all adults who can physically and financially undertake the journey. It is one of the five pillars of Islam, along with Shahadah (belief in the oneness of God and acceptance of Muhammad as prophet), Salat (prayer), Zakat (charity) and Sawm (fasting). The Hajj is a demonstration of the solidarity of the Muslim people, and their submission to Allah.\nHajj: Muslims gather atop the mountain during the Day of Arafat\nWhat date is Hajj 2018? Hajj begins on the eighth day of the Dhu al-Hijjah, so is also dependant on the moon sighting. This year, it is due to commence on August 19, and will continue until August 24. On the tenth day then, Eid al-Adha will commence and those on the pilgrimage will observe the festival. This is the day when an animal will be slaughtered in honour of the prophet Ibrahim.\nEid 2018: Last year, about two million Muslims travelled to Mecca for Hajj."

            "Click here for American League recap.\nBelow is a collection of notes on each National League team\u2019s draft class. We\u2019ve tried to touch briefly on the players each club selected through the first five rounds or so, with observations on players selected after that at our discretion. Generally, these are the prospects we think both (a) have a chance to appear on a team prospect list sometime in the near future and also (b) are likely to sign. The number in parentheses after each player\u2019s name is the round in which he was drafted.\nFor more details on many of these players, consult THE BOARD, which has tool grades, links to video, and various information about the players.\nArizona Diamondbacks\nLink to Draft Selections\nSoCal prep 2B Matt McLain (1) is a smaller guy with a plus hit tool and the speed/hands to play somewhere up the middle\u2026 Virginia CF Jake McCarthy (CBA) missed most of the spring with a broken wrist but has average raw power, plus speed, and feel to hit, though he\u2019ll need a swing adjustment in pro ball\u2026 Illinois prep CF Alek Thomas (2) has a long track record of hitting and has good feel for the game but slipped because of concerns about a lack of physicality. That won\u2019t matter if he hits like proponents think he will\u2026 Kansas RHP Jackson Goddard (3) is a power arm who flashes electric stuff and likely lands in relief\u2026 Wright State RHP Ryan Weiss (4) shows solid-average stuff, has a back-end-starter profile\u2026 Oregon RHP Matt Mercer (5) is a Driveline guy who throws with high effort up to 97 mph. He has four pitches, but the changeup is way ahead of the breaking balls and he may end up in relief\u2026 Florida prep RHP Levi Kelly (8) is maxed out and is a fringe athlete, but he\u2019s up to 96 mph and flashes a plus slider at times\u2026 Florida State LHP Tyler Holton (9) had Tommy John surgery this spring but flashed solid-average stuff and feel when healthy\u2026 Florida prep SS Blaze Alexander (11) has power, a 70 arm, and a chance to play shortstop but has had swing-and-miss issues against good pitching\u2026 Kentucky RHP Justin Lewis (12) is ultra lanky, sitting 89-93 mph with an above-average changeup and enough breaking ball to stick as a starter.\nAtlanta Braves\nLink to Draft Selections\nFlorida prep RHP Carter Stewart (1) has a chance for two 70 pitches in his fastball and curve, along with the starter traits, projection, and athleticism to project to the front of a rotation\u2026 Wichita State RF/1B Greyson Jenista (2) has sneaky athleticism and 65-grade raw power from the left side that could produce 30 bombs a year. He\u2019ll need a swing adjustment, though, and there\u2019s some risk that changing him hurts his ability to make contact\u2026 Stanford RHP Tristan Beck (4) was a first-round talent in high school but has been injured a lot since his senior year. He now has four pitches, the best of which is his curveball, and inconsistent command. He has third- or fourth-starter upside if things bounce back\u2026 Junior college RHP Trey Riley (5) transferred from Oklahoma State and his stuff ticked up, hitting 97. He\u2019ll flash an above-average slider and has a chance to start\u2026 UNC Greensboro CF Andrew Moritz (6) has fringe physical tools but a great feel to hit\u2026 Stetson closer Brooks Wilson (7) is a senior sign with three solid-average pitches and comes right at hitters\u2026 Washington SS A.J. Graffanino (8) is the son of Tony Graffanino and is super lanky and smooth at short. He has limited power and was injured much of this year but has some feel to hit\u2026 Texas RHP Nolan Kingham (12) looked like a first-round pick as a freshman and has been up to 97 mph but has been very inconsistent\u2026 California prep RHP Victor Vodnik (14) is just 6-foot even and looked like a young Trevor Bauer last fall, up to 97 mph with a 55 breaking ball and a quick, efficient arm action. He sat closer to 90 mph this spring, though\u2026 1B C.J. Alexander (20) is the older brother of D-backs 11th-rounder Blaze Alexander. He has plus raw power and posted big numbers this spring.\nChicago Cubs\nLink to Draft Selections\nStanford 2B Nico Hoerner (1) has plus-plus speed, great bat-to-ball ability, and sneaky power, but it\u2019s unclear what up-the-middle position he plays and he doesn\u2019t lift the ball much\u2026 Arizona prep CF Brennen Davis (2) is a classic power/speed lottery ticket with lots of risk on the contact\u2026 SoCal prep CF Cole Roederer (comp 2) had a late injury that dried up his market a bit, but he has great feel to hit and a shot to stay in center\u2026 San Diego RHP Paul Richan (comp 2) was likely an underslot play to sign the prep outfielders, has solid-average stuff and some moxie as a back-end/up-and-down type\u2026 Duke CF Jimmy Herron (3) has a football background and plus speed but a very flat swing path with little power\u2026 Virginia 2B Andy Weber (5) has an advanced feel to hit and is decent at second base, lacks power\u2026 Liberty CF D.J. Artis (7) has a very patient approach and is a plus runner who can play center but not a whole lot else. The Cubs draft someone like this every year\u2026 Virginia RHP Derek Casey (9) is a favorite senior sign of ours, with a good frame and good delivery. He also throws strikes and has average stuff\u2026 Southern Miss 3B Luke Reynolds (9) put up big numbers this year and could turn into a corner utility type\u2026 Louisville RHP Riley Thompson (11) has a truly electric arm, running his heater up to 99 mph, but the command and consistency have never been there. Mitchell Parker (28) is a prep lefty from New Mexico with upper-80s stuff, which plays better due to deception, and a good curveball.\nCincinnati Reds\nLink to Draft Selections\nFlorida 3B Jonathan India (1) was a third- to fourth-rounder entering the year, but remade his body and dominated the SEC this spring with improved tools\u2026 Florida prep RHP Lyon Richardson (2) is maxed-out physically and some don\u2019t love his arm action, but he\u2019s got a really live arm and has been up to 96 mph this spring with a 55 slider and other starter traits\u2026 Le Moyne RHP Josiah Gray (2) is a D2 conversion guy who pounds the zone with a plus fastball. His secondaries are raw \u2026 Illinois RF Bren Spillane (3) put up monster numbers and has plus, all-fields raw power along with enough athleticism to try the outfield\u2026 Virginia prep CF Mike Siani (4) will sign for well over slot as a fringe first-round talent with four above-average tools\u2026 UC Santa Barbara RHP Noah Davis (11) looked like a second-rounder this fall, hitting 97 mph with his sinker and showing starter traits, but had Tommy John last month\u2026 Florida RHP Michael Byrne (14) will be a tough sign, as there\u2019s talk of him shifting from the Gators closer role into their rotation next year, where his solid-average stuff may play better than it did in one-inning stints. He may make himself some money\u2026 UCF 1B Rylan Thomas (26) is squatty with explosive hands that create 65 or 70 raw power. He has a 60 arm but his feet limits him to first, and his power-based approach gives him some trouble with good breaking stuff.\nColorado Rockies\nLink to Draft Selections\nOle Miss LHP Ryan Rolison (1) looked like a top-10 pick after a few outings this spring, but then he struggled with fastball command (which might be fixable if it\u2019s just a stride-direction issue) and coaches didn\u2019t encourage him to use his changeup\u2026 New Hampshire prep 1B Grant Lavigne (CBA) has easy plus raw power and a really good swing, and they need to bear serious fruit because he\u2019s likely first-base-only\u2026 Texas A&M RHP Mitchell Kilkenny (2) doesn\u2019t have a sexy profile, but he\u2019s an effective back-end-starter type with solid-average stuff who\u2019ll hit 95 mph every now and then\u2026 Minnesota 3B Terrin Vavra (3) performs when healthy and has about average tools across the board\u2026 Ohio State RHP Ryan Feltner (4) has been up to 98 mph this spring but works more 91-94 mph with sink and 55 a changeup. He probably fits in relief\u2026 UCLA RHP Jake Bird (5) has solid-average stuff and some moxie\u2026 Loyola Marymount RF Niko Decolati (6) has been an inconsistent performer and has no clear position, but he has sizable strength-driven power for an infielder\u2026 Fullerton RHP Andrew Quezada is a smallish righty who works in the low 90s with a back-end or swing-guy profile\u2026 Washington C Willie MacIver (9) broke his hamate this spring and didn\u2019t catch, but he hit on the Cape and has a chance to catch once he\u2019s physically able to do it again\u2026 Oklahoma LF Cade Harris (10) was in a loaded OU outfield with Kyler Murray and Steele Walker but has more average tools across the board, a reserve type\u2026 North Carolina 3B Kyle Datres (12) showed some big-league potential in flashes at UNC with average-type tools but nothing loud.\nLos Angeles Dodgers\nLink to Draft Selections\nMississippi prep RHP J.T. Ginn (1) has arguably the best two-pitch combo in the draft with his fastball/curveball, but he\u2019s maxed-out physically and is likely a reliever\u2026 West Virginia RHP Michael Grove (2) missed the year rehabbing TJ but was electric and lightly scouted last spring. There\u2019s shades of Mitchell White here\u2026 Hofstra LHP John Rooney (3) is a tall, pitchability lefty with average stuff and advanced command\u2026 Texas prep RHP Braydon Fisher (4) is very young for the class and runs his heater into the mid-90s along with a slider that flashes 55\u2026 Louisville 2B Devin Mann (5) is just okay defensively but has average hit/power/run tools that are useful anywhere\u2026 Florida 2B Deacon Liput (10) had an up-and-down career with the Gators but can stick in the dirt, has average raw power, and has hit at times\u2026 Junior college RHP Trey Dillard (16) has been up to 99 mph with an average slider, but command/consistency issues\u2026 Morehead State RF Niko Hulsizer (18) broke his hamate bone this year but has been productive and has big raw power.\nMiami Marlins\nLink to Draft Selections\nFlorida prep CF Connor Scott (1) is a 6-foot-4 athlete who\u2019s a 70 runner and has a smooth lefty cut but was hurt a lot this spring\u2026 NorCal prep CF Osiris Johnson (2) is super young for the class and has top-of-the-scale bat speed and athletic actions but didn\u2019t perform last summer when he faced good pitching\u2026 Georgia prep C Will Banfield (2) has a chance to be a plus receiver with a plus arm and 55 raw power, but his swing has changed more times than most scouts can count\u2026 Kentucky LF Tristan Pompey (3) has plus raw power and some speed but poor defensive instincts, so that bat will need to play\u2026 Ole Miss C Nick Fortes (4) has a 45 arm but is a good receiver with a very patient approach and some offensive ability to fit as a modern catcher\u2026 Texas A&M RHP Cason Sherrod (7) is a senior who sits 92-95 with a 55 slider but had a down spring\u2026 Arkansas State RHP Peyton Culbertson (8) is a smaller relief type who\u2019s been into the high 90s this spring\u2026 Purdue righty Tanner Andrews (10) is a senior sign who\u2019s been up to 96 mph this spring and fits best in relief\nMilwaukee Brewers\nLink to Draft Selections\nSoCal prep SS Brice Turang (1) was the top prep bat in the class a year ago but had just an okay spring that dimmed him in the view of many\u2026 Mississippi prep RF Joe Gray (2) has given scouts good and bad looks at dozens of events over the years but finished with a strong spring. At worst, he\u2019s a classic right-field prototype with a volatile bat, but he has a better chance to stay in center than most prospects in that bucket\u2026 Hawaii prep CF Micah Bello (2) grew into a potential everyday center fielder this spring with physical development\u2026 Junior college LHP Aaron Ashby (4) is the nephew of Andy Ashby and has a plus curveball, low 90s heater, and gaudy numbers\u2026 Oregon State RHP Drew Rasmussen (6) is a senior sign who\u2019s rehabbing his second TJ but is up to 97 mph with back-of-the-bullpen stuff at his best\u2026 Auburn righty Davis Daniel(11) didn\u2019t have the durability to start this spring, then remade himself into a mid-90s reliever down the stretch\u2026 Florida prep RF Elijah Cabell (14) has 65 raw power and arm strength in a Clint Frazier-type swing, but he struck out nearly 30% of the time this spring as a nearly 19-year-old high schooler\u2026 Junior college RHP Nick Iverson (15) works in the low-90s and hits 95 mph when he\u2019s on, with solid-average stuff and a back-end-starter profile.\nNew York Mets\nLink to Draft Selections\nWisconsin CF Jarred Kelenic (1) is arguably the best prep hitter in the class and should stick in center while exhibiting about average power\u2026Texas prep RHP Simeon Woods-Richardson (2) is an athlete with a very loose arm who flashes three above-average pitches but is still pretty raw\u2026 South Carolina LF Carlos Cortes (3) has plus lefty raw power and ended the season hot after a terrible start. He\u2019s squatty, has played some second base ,and is ambidextrous\u2026 South Carolina RHP Adam Hill (4) looked like a second-rounder some days and a seventh-rounder on others. His fastball/slider/command trifecta could produce a fourth starter or middle reliever\u2026 Clemson RHP Ryley Gilliam (5) reminds some of Trevor Gott, a smaller reliever who gets into the mid-90s with a sharp curve and is always in attack mode\u2026 Tylor Megill (8) is a big righty from Arizona with a low-90s fastball and average slide\u2026 Cal Poly C Nick Meyer (6) is an above-average defender and thrower who has a little contact ability but no power\u2026 Missouri RHP Bryce Montes de Oca (9) has had injuries, but is a 6-foot-7 behemoth who\u2019s hit 100 mph. The Mets drafted a bunch of big college arms on Day 2.\nPhiladelphia Phillies\nLink to Draft Selections\nWichita State 3B Alec Bohm (1) has 70 raw power and looks like Kris Bryant if you squint, but he needs to make some swing adjustments and improve defensively\u2026 Fullerton RHP Colton Eastman (4) sits 90-92 with an above-average changeup and improving curve that\u2019s above average at times. He threw more strikes this year\u2026 Notre Dame RF Matt Vierling (5) has above-average raw power, arm strength, and athleticism but likely fits on a corner\u2026 Georgia prep SS Kendall Simmons (6) had a rough spring at the plate but looked like a young Addison Russell at times last summer. He\u2019s twitchy and explosive and looks great taking BP but is erratic in games\u2026 Seth Lancaster (8) is a rowdy senior-sign shortstop with low-ball power and a terrible mustache. NorCal prep RHP Dominic Pipkin (9) had a down spring, as well. At his best, he peaks at 96 mph with a super loose arm and starter traits\u2026 SS Matt Kroon (18) bounced all over the place as an amateur but stuck the landing as a junior at Oklahoma State and had great numbers. He has a utility infield profile, enough arm for the left side, and experience at several infield spots.\nPittsburgh Pirates\nLink to Draft Selections\nSouth Alabama CF Travis Swaggerty (1) has plus tools galore and hit last summer with wood for Team USA, then had an uneven spring adjusting to a new power-focused swing\u2026 Florida prep RHP Gunnar Hoglund (CBA) and second-rounder Texas prep RHP Braxton Ashcraft are both classic projection arms with clean deliveries and three pitches around average now, with Hoglund possessing a little more present stuff\u2026 Vanderbilt SS Connor Kaiser (3) is in the mold of Jordy Mercer as a big shortstop with a solid glove, some power, and inconsistent contact/rhythm\u2026 Arkansas C Grant Koch (5) improved as a defender this year, but his offense backed up a bit after having been regarded as a power-over-hit offensive catcher last season\u2026 Arizona RHP Michael Flynn (6) has been up to 95 mph this spring but his offspeed and command are more fringe to average, profiling as a back-end starter or middle reliever\u2026 North Carolina State LF Brett Kinneman (7) is limited to left and has some swing-and-miss concerns, but he tapped into his 55 raw power a lot this year\u2026 UConn C Zach Susi (12) has a line-drive swing and limited offensive upside but can stick behind the plate\u2026 Duke SS Zack Kone (13) is another big shortstop with some power and contact questions like Kaiser\u2026 Cal LF Jonah Davis (15) is a fringey defender with swing-and-miss concerns but has plus raw power that he gets to in games.\nSan Diego Padres\nLink to Draft Selections\nTennessee prep LHP Ryan Weathers (1) is the son of David Weathers. All three pitches and his command are above average despite a very short stride and maxed-out frame\u2026 Florida prep 2B Xavier Edwards (CBA) is an 80 runner who fits somewhere up the middle and has a long track record of hitting from both sides of the plate\u2026 Texas Tech 2B Grant Little (CBB) doesn\u2019t have a clear position and doesn\u2019t have loud tools but is average across the board with monster numbers\u2026 Missouri State RHP Dylan Coleman (4) is 6-foot-6 and has been up to 97 mph while showing a 55 slider, but he may ultimately end up in the pen\u2026 East Carolina RF Dwanya Williams-Sutton (5) is a solid athlete with big raw power and huge exit velos but just okay numbers\u2026 Rutgers CF Jawuan Harris (7) has above-average to plus tools across the board but 30 pitch recognition and limited reps due to football and a pot suspension\u2026 Texas Tech RHP Jose Quezada (10) is a senior sign who works 91-95 with a slider that\u2019s a 55 at times\u2026 Pennsylvania prep 2B Sean Guilbe (12) will stick in the dirt and has above-average power along with some feel to hit\u2026 Georgia 1B Michael Curry (16) has plus raw power and some hitability that gives him a chance to profile after moving full-time from catcher.\nSan Francisco Giants\nLink to Draft Selections\nGeorgia Tech C Joey Bart (1) has plus raw power and arm strength, along with elite makeup and surprising defensive ability for a catcher of his size. Contact is the only question\u2026 Kentucky RHP Sean Hjelle (2) is 6-foot-11 and throws a low-90s sinker with a one-of-a-kind plane and average offspeed stuff. He fits as a No. 4 starter\u2026 Grand Canyon RHP Jake Wong (3) attacks with sinking 94-96 but has fringe to average offspeed stuff. He could work as a back-end starter or seventh-/eighth-inning guy\u2026 Junior college RHP Blake Rivera (4) was up to 97 mph this spring with an above-average slider and is likely a long-term fit in the bullpen\u2026 UCF LHP Bryce Tucker (14) works in the low 90s with a solid-average slider and possibly the most intense mound presence in the draft\u2026 Ole Miss CF Ryan Olenek (17) is an under-the-radar favorite of ours: a lanky 6-foot-4 plus runner with plus bat control and sneaky power who rarely struck out this year. He\u2019s on the draft tracker as a pitcher. On the mound, he gets into the low 90s with an average curveball.\nSt. Louis Cardinals\nLink to Draft Selections\nArizona prep 3B Nolan Gorman (1) has plus-plus raw power and was arguably the top prep bat in the class; he fell into the Cardinals\u2019 lap here\u2026 Wake Forest RHP Griffin Roberts (CBA) didn\u2019t sign last year after closing. He went much higher this year after showing he can start and isn\u2019t just a sideshow with a plus-plus slider\u2026 TCU 1B Luken Baker (2) had a tough college career with multiple injuries and some issues hitting average velocity, but he\u2019s a giant and has 70 raw power, so there\u2019s ceiling if he hits\u2026 Texas prep SS Mateo Gil (3) is the son of former big leaguer Benji Gil and is solid on the mound as well, but he has more upside as a hitter with solid-average tools across the board\u2026 Texas Tech LHP Steven Gingery (4) had TJ surgery earlier this spring. He has a plus changeup and starter traits that likely would\u2019ve had him in the top two rounds if he\u2019d been healthy\u2026 Maryland 2B Nick Dunn (5) is just okay with the glove at second and doesn\u2019t have much power but is one of the top hitters in this college class\u2026 South Alabama 3B Brendan Donovan (7) got some shine from scouts bearing down on teammate Travis Swaggerty but is solid in his own right, with average offensive tools in a corner-utility-type profile\u2026 USC 1B Lars Nootbaar (8) looked like a potential first-day pick last fall but had tons of contact issues this spring; he still has 65 or 70 raw power and hit well last year\u2026 Parker Kelly (20) is the brother of Carson Kelly. He\u2019s a relief righty from Oregon whose delivery and plus slider are tough on righties\u2026 Puerto Rican SS Kevin Vargas (22) has a utility look.\nWashington Nationals\nLink to Draft Selections\nFlorida prep RHP Mason Denaburg (1) has been up to 97 mph with a present plus curve and has flashed a 55 change. He would have gone higher had he not missed a month due to biceps tendinitis\u2026 UConn LHP Tim Cate (2) also missed time with an arm issue and likely fits in relief. He tops out at 95 mph with a present plus curve\u2026 Vanderbilt RHP Reid Schaller (3) came out of nowhere this spring (he\u2019s a redshirt freshman) to hit 99 mph, but his slider and command came and went at times\u2026 Oklahoma RHP Jake Irvin (4) has been in the mid-90s in the past but was mostly 90-93 with an average curve this spring as a starter\u2026 Arizona State CF Gage Canning (5) is a plus-plus runner who has some power but a 4 bat\u2026 FSU RHP Andrew Karp (6) has had an up-and-down career but works 89-93 mph with an above-average changeup and starter traits\u2026 South Carolina RHP Ridge Chapman (17) had a velo bump late in the year, working 93-96 mph with a slider and change that flashed average\u2026 Tennessee RHP Zach Linginfelter (19) hasn\u2019t progressed much since being a big name on the high-school showcase circuit, but he\u2019s a big kid up to 96 mph and flashes a 55 breaker."

            "Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) came back from his June 30-July 5 trip to Russia with some new perspectives on the sanctions the U.S. imposed on Moscow after its annexation of Crimea and interference in the 2016 presidential election. \"We need to take a look at sanctions \u2014 are they actually changing Russia's behavior?\" he told Sirius XM Washington correspondent Olivier Knox on Friday. \"And right now, unfortunately, I don't think they're particularly working from that standpoint.\"\nThe eight-Republican delegation to St. Petersburg and Moscow \u2014 led by Sen. Richard Shelby (Ala.) and including Johnson, Rep. Kay Granger (Texas) and Sens. Steve Daines (Mont.), John Hoeven (N.D.), John Kennedy (La.), Jerry Moran (Kan.), and John Thune (S.D.) \u2014 met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian lawmakers, though not President Vladimir Putin. \"Members of the delegation set off on their trip late last week promising to be tough with Russian officials ahead of the president's visit, especially on matters of election interference,\" The Washington Post reported. \"But they struck a conciliatory tone once there,\" which \"played well in Moscow, but not on the home front.\"\nJohnson told The Washington Examiner that the GOP delegation did hammer the Russians on Moscow's meddling in the 2016 election, but the Russians \"would push back with all the ways we interfere in their politics in terms of funding NGOs, and Radio Free Europe and Voice of America,\" and \"nobody yielded.\" At the same time, he added, \"I've been pretty upfront that the election interference \u2014 as serious as that was, and unacceptable \u2014 is not the greatest threat to our democracy. ... We've blown it way out of proportion.\" Johnson also said some sanctions did have promise: \"My sense is that the targeted sanctions to the oligarchs, to the members of government, are the ones that really sting and probably [offer] the best chance of affecting their behavior.\""

            "Olivia Jade Giannulli could face expulsion from the University of Southern California (USC) following news that her parents, \u201cFull House\u201d alum Lori Loughlin and fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, are allegedly ensnared in a bombshell college admissions scandal that involved wealthy families paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to secure a place for their children at prestigious universities across the country.\nIn a statement to Fox News on Thursday, a spokesperson for USC said school officials plan to \u201cconduct a case-by-case review for current students and graduates that may be connected to the scheme alleged by the government.\u201d\nLORI LOUGHLIN RELEASED ON $1 MILLION BOND FOLLOWING ARREST IN ALLEGED COLLEGE ADMISSIONS BRIBERY SCAM\n\u201cWe will make informed, appropriate decisions once those reviews have been completed,\u201d the spokesperson said, noting some of the students under review \u201cmay have been minors at the time of their application process.\u201d\nOlivia's parents are accused of agreeing to pay $500,000 in bribes to have their two daughters designated as recruits for the USC crew team despite the fact that neither participated in the sport.\nThe 19-year-old USC freshman is a famous YouTube star who goes by \"Olivia Jade\" on the video sharing platform as well as Instagram and Twitter, where she boasts more than 1 million and nearly 200,000 followers, respectively.\nA spokesperson for USC confirmed to Fox News Thursday night that Loughlin and Giannulli\u2019s other daughter, Isabella, 20, is currently enrolled at the university.\nA video Olivia posted to her YouTube channel in August of 2018 has resurfaced as a result of the scandal, as the teen said at the time that she doesn\u2019t \u201creally care about school.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much of school I\u2019m gonna attend,\u201d she previously told her nearly 2 million subscribers in the video, which has been viewed more than 1.5 million times. \u201cBut I\u2019m gonna go in and talk to my deans and everyone, and hope that I can try and balance it all. But I do want the experience of like game days, partying\u2026 I don\u2019t really care about school, as you guys all know.\u201d\nDays later, she released a follow-up video apologizing for her remarks.\n\u201cI said something super ignorant and stupid, basically,\u201d Olivia admitted in the video. \u201cAnd it totally came across that I\u2019m ungrateful for college \u2014 I\u2019m going to a really nice school. And it just kind of made it seem like I don\u2019t care, I just want to brush it off. I\u2019m just gonna be successful at YouTube and not have to worry about school. I\u2019m really disappointed in myself.\u201d\n\u201cA lot of people like to attack me for the way I\u2019ve grown up because it\u2019s really different from a lot of people,\u201d she added.\nOlivia has not been charged with a crime as a result of the scandal, nor have any of the other children whose parents were charged Tuesday. She was reportedly with friends on a USC official's yacht in the Bahamas when she became aware of the scandal.\nIn addition to the resurfacing of her video, the teen has been facing backlash in other areas. It appears Olivia has disabled the comments section on her Instagram profile due to hateful remarks, while Variety reports she could possibly lose brand deals as a result of the scheme.\nThe social media star has partnerships with Amazon, Dolce & Gabbana, Lulus, Marc Jacobs Beauty, Sephora, and Smashbox Beauty Cosmetic, among other big name brands, according to Variety. Already, HP has cut ties with Olivia, telling the publication in a statement that it has \u201cremoved the content from its properties\u201d regarding its one-time product campaign with both Olivia and her mother, who was released on a $1 million bond Wednesday following her arrest.\nSephora, too, is facing pressure to drop its partnership with her but has not yet said whether or not it plans to do so.\nOlivia is both a collaborator and paid influencer with the makeup giant, releasing an eponymous bronzing powder palette with the superstore in December 2018, according to InStyle.\nThe USC spokesperson also told Fox News that applicants in the university\u2019s current admission cycle \u201cwho are connected to the scheme alleged by the government will be denied admission to USC.\u201d There are six students in the current admission cycle who are allegedly connected to the scheme, USC confirmed.\n\u201cUSC is still working to identify any donations potentially connected to the scheme, but there was $1.3 million noted in the indictment,\u201d the spokesperson added.\nUSC, in a separate statement following the initial news of the scandal, said it is \"aware of the ongoing wide-ranging criminal investigation involving universities nationwide, including USC.\" School officials in the statement added the university has \"not been accused of any wrongdoing\" and noted it \"will continue to cooperate fully with the government\u2019s investigation.\"\n\"We understand that the government believes that illegal activity was carried out by individuals who went to great lengths to conceal their actions from the university. USC is conducting an internal investigation,\" the school continued, announcing both Donna Heinel and Jovan Vavic \u2014 the school's senior associate athletic director and water polo coach, respectively \u2014 had been terminated as a result of their alleged involvement in the scheme.\nLORI LOUGHLIN'S YOUTUBE STAR DAUGHTER OLIVIA JADE SAID PARENTS ADVISED 'HARD WORK PAYS OFF' BEFORE SCANDAL\nThe school emphasized it would take any additional \"employment actions\" that it deems appropriate.\n\"USC is in the process of identifying any funds received by the university in connection with this alleged scheme. Additionally, the university is reviewing its admissions processes broadly to ensure that such actions do not occur going forward,\" USC added.\nFox News\u2019 Sasha Savitsky, Mariah Haas and Janine Puhak contributed to this report."

            "Dasiah Jordan was arrested after her 11-month-old daughter drowned after falling through the floor at her home. The basement was filled with water. (Video: WXYZ)\nGift Article Share\nUpdated At first glance, the white house on Ferguson Street in Detroit looks like any other home commonly found in American suburbs. Its front lawn is mowed and decorated with thick green shrubbery. Its peaked roof is covered in gray shingles. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The interior, however, is another story. Video footage shows dark rooms cluttered with garbage. While some windows allow sunlight in, others are boarded up with large planks. Once-white walls are yellowed, bare patches exposed where paint used to be. In the corner of one bedroom, a gaping hole in the floor goes straight to the house\u2019s basement.\nIt was through this hole that authorities say 11-month-old Ca\u2019Mya Davis fell and died on July 6, a couple of weeks before her first birthday.\nBut the infant didn\u2019t die from blunt force trauma or injuries usually related to falls. She drowned \u201cin standing water and sewage in the basement,\u201d according to a statement from the Wayne County Prosecutor\u2019s Office. Before her death, Ca\u2019Mya was \u201croaming the house unattended,\u201d prosecutors alleged.\nAdvertisement\nThe Wayne County medical examiner ruled the death an accidental drowning, according to the Detroit News.\nOn Tuesday, 26-year-old Dasiah Jordan, Ca\u2019Mya\u2019s mother, was arraigned on one count of involuntary manslaughter and one count of second-degree child abuse, according to court records. A second woman, 28-year-old Tonya Peterson, was arraigned Wednesday and faces the same charges, the statement said. Peterson also lived at the home where Ca\u2019Mya died, the Detroit News reported. No attorneys were listed for the women.\nJordan told WJBK that she had been living in the house since April.\n\u201cI lived here for a couple months because I didn\u2019t have nowhere else to go,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go back to my dad\u2019s or go back to my auntie\u2019s house. I thought I could do it on my own.\u201d\nOn July 6, Jordan allegedly went to visit friends and left Ca\u2019Mya in Peterson\u2019s care \u201cin an unsafe home,\u201d the statement said.\nAdvertisement\nWhile Ca\u2019Mya couldn\u2019t really walk, Jordan told WJBK the infant could \u201cstand up on stuff\u201d and \u201cwalk along walls.\u201d\n\u201cI just bought her some shoes, so she can get her balance,\u201d Jordan said.\nIn the statement, prosecutors allege that Jordan and Petersen were \u201caware of the hazardous and unsafe condition in the bedroom.\u201d\nUsually, the hole is covered, Jordan told WJBK, adding that she wasn\u2019t sure why Ca\u2019Mya was even in the room at the time.\nAt around 11:30 p.m., EMTs responded to a 911 call about a child not breathing, prosecutors said. CPR was administered and Ca\u2019Mya was rushed to a local hospital, but it was too late.\nAccording to a GoFundMe page for Ca\u2019Mya\u2019s funeral expenses, Jordan did not know her daughter had died. She received text messages telling her she needed to come home, and when she called the babysitter, she was told to go to the hospital.\nThinking it was a \u201cbroken-arm type of emergency at the most,\u201d Jordan arrived to learn the tragic news.\n\u201cFirst he asked me was the basement flooded, and that\u2019s when it hit me,\u201d Jordan told WJBK. \u201cI started crying, and that\u2019s when he told me my baby drowned in a basement.\u201d\nJordan and Peterson are scheduled to appear in court July 24 for a probable cause conference, the statement said.\nGiftOutline Gift Article"

            "LONDON \u2014 Tests on two Britons found unconscious in their home determined that they were poisoned by the same nerve agent used against a former Russian spy and his daughter earlier this year, British police said Wednesday.\nThe discovery triggered new security precautions in the area of Amesbury, England, where the couple were sickened.\nThe town is seven miles from Salisbury, where former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with the military-grade nerve agent Novichok in March. The British government blamed Russia for the attack. Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement.\nFriends and investigators identified the victims as Dawn Sturgess, 44, and Charlie Rowley, 45, who remained in critical condition early Thursday.\nCounterterrorism police have taken over the investigation, and authorities acknowledged that the test results would fuel speculation about whether the two poisoning incidents were linked.\n\"However, I must say that we are not in a position to say whether the nerve agent was from the same batch that the Skripals were exposed to,\" Neil Basu, assistant commissioner of specialist operations for London Metropolitan Police, said in a statement. \"The possibility that these two investigations might be linked is clearly a line of inquiry for us.\"\nHome Secretary Sajid Javid \u2014 Britain's interior minister \u2014 said in an address to Parliament on Thursday that the incident would \"obviously... invoke memories of the reckless murder attempts of Sergei and Yulia Skripal earlier this year.\"\nJavid continued: \"The eyes of the world are currently on Russia, not least because of the World Cup. It is now time that the Russian state comes forward and explains exactly what has gone on.\"\n\"We do not have a quarrel with the Russian people. Rather it is the actions of the Russian government that continue to undermine our security and that of the international community.\"\n\"We will stand up to the actions that threaten our security, and the security of our partners. It is completely unacceptable for our people to be deliberate or accidental targets, or for our streets, our parks, our towns to be dumping grounds for poison,\" he said.\nSturgess and Rowley were found unconscious at separate times in the same home on Saturday. Investigators initially suspected that they had overdosed on heroin or cocaine, but after observing their symptoms \u2500 police didn't describe them \u2500 authorities took samples for lab testing. Those tests came back positive for Novichok, Basu said.\nHe added that no one else had reported falling ill with similar symptoms.\nInvestigators are now focusing on how and where Burgess and Rowley came into contact with Novichok, Basu said.\nAs a \"precautionary measure,\" police cordoned off sites in the Amesbury and Salisbury areas that they believe the two visited just before they were sickened, Basu said.\n\"I do want to reassure the public, however, that there is no evidence that either the man or woman recently visited any of the sites that were decontaminated following the attempted murders of Sergei and Yulia Skripal,\" Basu said.\nIn Salisbury, a supported housing complex for the homeless was cordoned off 840 feet from Zizzi's, the restaurant the Skripals dined at the evening they were poisoned. So, too, was Queen Elizabeth Gardens \u2014 a park just 1,300 feet from where the Skripals were found.\nMike Wade, the director of health protection at the southwest branch of the government agency Public Health England, said in a statement Thursday that the risk to the public continued to be low.\nAmesbury is about five miles from Stonehenge, the prehistoric monument visited by more than a million people annually.\nFrancis Whittaker reported from London, and Jon Schuppe from New York."

            "Credit: Epic Games\nIt would be easy to be confused about the name, but take note: this is not Friday Fortnite, the Keemstar-hosted Fortnite tournament that served as the first major professional Fortnite event. Keemstar's Friday Fortnite was eventually cancelled after Epic kept scheduling Fall/Summer Skirmish events on Friday night, and as a sort of nail in the coffin the developer has apparently decided to start holding its own in-game weekly tournament and naming it Friday Night Fortnite. The first one starts tonight, so read on for rules, timing, scoring and more.\nStart/End Times: The first Friday Night Fortnite starts tonight, October 19. It runs from 7:00-11:00 p.m. local time and once it's done, it's done. The tournament system is still very much in the early phases, so there may well be technical problems during that time.\nRules/Scoring: Friday Night Fortnite is a squad mode, and it does not appear that it will have matchmaking for your own team: you'll need to bring along three friends if you want to compete. Scoring is similar to what we saw in the first Alpha tournament: points are awarded for both placement and elimination, with up to a total of six points from a given match. As some people have been figuring out, it sometimes pays to just drop into Tilted, rack up some kills and then die rather than try to tough it out to the end.\nYou enter through mode selection, and you can see details under the \"events\" tab in the lobby.\ncredit: epic Games\nPrizes: Just like with the previous solo tournament, the prize is a shiny pin. You'll need to get 25 points to earn your pin, and you're restricted not by the number of matches played but by the 7:00-11:00-time range.\nMatchmaking: A regular Fortnite match has platform-based rather than skill-based matchmaking. Touchscreen players play against each other, controller players play against each other, etc. Not so here: things are meant to be more difficult as the tournament goes on, so you'll be matched with other people that have a similar point total as you regardless of platform. It's a bold idea, and it's not without its problems: touchscreen players will always be destroyed by PC players, for example. This is one of those systems that are very much still in progress.\nExpectations: Things have been a little rough with these tournaments so far between queuing, matchmaking and other problems. That's why Epic is billing these as practice runs, with the full tournaments yet to come. Just don't go in expecting something totally smooth, and know that you might not get all the points you're after due to technicalorf other problems. It's a work in progress."

            "Spravato nasal spray is a mind-altering medication related to the club drug Special K, won U.S. approval Tuesday, March 5, 2019, for patients with hard-to-treat depression, the first in a series of long-overlooked substances being reconsidered for severe forms of mental illness. (AP)\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved a drug that is closely related to the party drug ketamine to be prescribed as a fast-acting treatment of depression on adults who don\u2019t benefit from other types of treatment.\nLast month, a panel of experts from FDA\u2019s advisory committee held a decisive vote in favor of approving esketamine, noting that its benefits outweighed its risks. On Tuesday, the agency announced that it had granted the approval of Spravato to Janssen Pharmaceuticals, part of Johnson & Johnson.\nAdvertisement\nSpravato is a nasal spray that, when used in conjunction with an oral antidepressant, has been shown to relieve symptoms in hours, instead of weeks.\nMajor depressive disorder is one of the most common mental disorders in the U.S., affecting over 16 million Americans; 121 million people worldwide are believed to be affected.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThis is potentially a game-changer for millions of people,\u201d Dr. Dennis Charney, the dean of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, told NPR\u2019s Morning Edition. \u201c[Depression] is essentially a deadly disease when you haven't responded to available treatments and you've been suffering for years, if not decades.\u201d\n\u201cThere has been a long-standing need for additional effective treatments for treatment-resistant depression, a serious and life-threatening condition,\u201d Tiffany Farchione, acting director of the Division of Psychiatry Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.\nKetamine was approved as an anesthetic nearly 50 years ago, and it gained popularity as a club drug in the 1990s, as part of the dance floor/rave culture, possibly because of its psychedelic effects. It blocks sensory perception, which can lead to the distortion of sights, colors, sounds, self, and one's environment by separating perception from sensation.\nAs a street drug, it\u2019s commonly referred to as \u201cSpecial K,\u201d \u201cK,\u201d \u201cKit Kat,\u201d and \u201cKitty,\u201d and it belongs to a class of drugs called dissociative anesthetics. Other drugs in this category include phencyclidine (PCP) and dextromethorphan (DXM).\nBecause of the potential risk caused by a potential misuse of the drug and adverse outcomes that can result from the dissociation it can cause \u2014 a \u201cK hole,\u201d as it\u2019s commonly referred to among recreational users of Special K \u2014 Spravato will only be available through a restricted controlled distribution model under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy."
